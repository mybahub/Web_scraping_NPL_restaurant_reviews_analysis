0,"4540 La Jolla Village Dr San Diego, CA 92122",Patty C.,"San Diego, CA",5/31/2021,5,"I was invited to have a birthday dinner here. I was glad because I have dined at PFChang enough time to know their food quality is not disappointing. I mentioned my rapid reward dining number to managers Drew and Brian. They both graciously acknowledged my information for future rewards. Our waitress Shadia was nice and professional. She made good recommendations and was quick with her service.  We started off with the spicy Kung Pao brussels sprouts, which was Wok charred and served with peanuts, chili pods and their house Kung Pao sauce. The flavor was delectable and needless to say, mouth-watering.  I decided OOlong Chilean sea bass for my entree. It was a wild-caught tea marinated filet, served with ginger soy sauce and spinach. The dish was sweeter then I preferred, but it still had a lot of flavor.  My friend ordered a Chang's spicy chicken, accompanied with a side of fried rice. The chicken was served in a sweet and spicy chili sauce. He commented that the flavor was pleasing because it had the rightful combination of spice. My birthday dessert was a famous Chang's Great Wall of chocolate. Easily shared because the six layer chocolate cake, laden with semi-sweet chocolate chips and chocolate frosting with a whopping 1700 calories. However, the taste was worth the gluttony.",92122

They did not charge us for the salad and they gave us a free desert but then the free desert took another almost 30 min to arrive, again the restaurant was not busy.  We were not the only table that was experiencing issues.   I did feel for the server and appreciated her taking responsibility for the salad order being incorrect the first time.  She clearly felt bad for all of the problems that we were experiencing.  Sadly, we will never go back.  They have a problem that they need to correct.  It's unfortunate because we really used to like going there.",92122

The hostess had no record of the reservation and I showed her my confirmation email from Open Table. She conferred with others and asked us to wait and we'd have a table in 10 minutes.At 725 pm we asked the hostess who had been seating other parties what the table status was for us. She stated that we were a walk in and we reminded her I had a confirmation of a reservation and was told to wait briefly. We were then shown to a tabletop for 4 people directly in front of the kitchen entrance. Our server was excellent, however we were given another  table's entree and then had one of main dishes come out 30 minutes after all the others were served. It was an extremely uneven night.",92122
3,"4540 La Jolla Village Dr San Diego, CA 92122",Vance E.,"CA, CA",6/11/2021,1,"Staff is terrible. Will stand around chatting it up while you stand at their host stand waiting for them.When I ordered for pickup they said it'd be ready at 6:05. Got there at that time,  they said it wasn't ready and to take a seat. Sat down and waited over 30 minutes and heard nothing. Got impatient and went to the stand. Saw my order sitting right there and asked the other hostess (which there were 4 at that stand, zero at the takeout stand) if I could just grab it since I'd been there so long. She wouldn't let me so I had to wait for another one to return and literally just hand me the bag and nothing else. What a useless staff.. I would've sat there waiting indefinitely if I hadn't got up to check the names on the orders myself. Food is mediocre. Slightly better (not much though) than Panda for 2-3 times the price. Always seems not very fresh. Togo ramen is pretty good so I'll give them that, but that's about all this place has going for it.",92122
4,"4540 La Jolla Village Dr San Diego, CA 92122",Yueming Q.,"San Diego, CA",7/18/2021,4,"PF Chang is not very authentic Chinese food but I believe it meets more people's tastes in US. For me, I'm okay with that too. Today I ordered the wonton soup and Buddha's feast which I was very satisfied with both. The only thing is what my husband ordered - the dumplings taste weird to me because they are lobster dumplings with miso butter. We never put butter with dumplings so it's very strange to me, but my husband enjoyed it very much. He also enjoyed his dragon roll. We will come back, especially I wanna try their ma po tofu next time.",92122
5,"4540 La Jolla Village Dr San Diego, CA 92122",BB B.,"San Diego, CA",8/8/2021,1,The food was not fresh or hot when it came to our table the rice was mushy very disappointing.,92122
6,"4540 La Jolla Village Dr San Diego, CA 92122",Nathalie C.,"Mission Viejo, CA",5/7/2021,3,I havent been to PF Changs in a million years and I remember why. This place is so over priced for the quality of food you get here. The low mein was a joke. Like panda expresses chow mein has so much more flavor. The pepper steak was ridiculously overwhelmed with sauce that you can't eat it unless you chase it with a bog spoonful of PLAIN RICE. the sesame chicken was pretty good and the dynamite shrimp was okay. I would not go back. Nope. The service was good hence the 3 stars. But food is pure waste.,92122
7,"4540 La Jolla Village Dr San Diego, CA 92122",CJ M.,"Sandy Springs, GA",7/31/2021,5,"We ate here this week for a going away party. We had 20 people at our table. Our server, Mia, was amazing! She took everyone's food and drink order without writing anything down. Everything we ordered actually all came out as requested. We were all amazed. She was very friendly and helpful with navigating the menu and attending to our needs. The food was great as always (my husband and I order delivery from here every couple of weeks). Great experience!",92122
8,"4540 La Jolla Village Dr San Diego, CA 92122",Maria G.,"San Diego, CA",4/3/2021,3,"So we came here for dinner and ordered the lettuce wrap and Chicken Pad Thai. We placed an order to be picked up. Overall, the food is decent but not authentic Chinese. What did we like about the place? Menu selection- especially the selection for gluten free. I also appreciated that they labeled the containers that were gluten free because we ordered two Chicken Pad Thais, one of which was gluten free and the other one was regular. Placing the order was simple and pickup went smoothly. The food tasted fresh. What would prevent us from returning? First, the parking is terrible. Luckily, my husband drove so he was able to wait by the curb while I ran in. Second, the prices. The food wasn't worth it. To pay over $50 for three mediocre dishes is too much. Third, the food. Okay, maybe I should have listed this reason first but the parking situation was pretty crazy when we got there so I am still thinking about it. Anyway, even though I appreciated the gluten free options, both the lettuce wrap and Chicken Pad Thai were a little on the sweet side. The portion sizes were also a little on the small size.",92122
9,"4540 La Jolla Village Dr San Diego, CA 92122",Christine H.,"Brea, CA",5/31/2021,1,"I'm so sad to say that this location is horrible. I gave it two chances before writing this review as I hate to write negative reviews and have always loved PF Chang's. First, our table was super sticky then we had to wait a very long time before getting any service (15 min). When we finally did, I ordered a glass of sparkling Rose which came out flat and with RED lipstick on the glass. I of course sent it back and the server brought a new one and wanted to point out to me that it wasn't flat...I was not going to argue because my replacement glass was fine it just seemed odd that she'd push that point. The food was cold and not of the same quality as other PF Chang's I've been to. Trust me and don't come here. Even if staying across the parking lot as we did, just not worth it.",92122
10,"4540 La Jolla Village Dr San Diego, CA 92122",Devianna C.,"West Covina, CA",2/26/2021,5,"Kaitlin was absolutely amazing. I can't say thank you enough. She went above and beyond for me. I have nut allergies, and she made sure I would be taken care of and i appreciated her so much for it. Super sweet and always helpful. I recommend coming and asking to be seated in her area. Thank you!! You made my first PF chang experience great.",92122

12,"4540 La Jolla Village Dr San Diego, CA 92122",Ana F.,"San Leandro, CA",9/8/2020,5,"While staying in La Jolla for the Labor Day weekend, we ordered here through Uber eats. The packaging was perfect and all of our food arrived hot. The containers that it comes in are also super good quality so I'll be reusing those! :)The chicken wraps were absolutely delicious!",92122
13,"4540 La Jolla Village Dr San Diego, CA 92122",Vinh D.,"San Diego, CA",4/3/2021,1,"""AMAZING SERVICE"". I stood at their door for 10 mins watching about 5 of them service walking around and tried to grab their attention. Some look at me and kept walking away. Worst yet, a  handsome looking service walked toward me and stopped at the computer, 2 steps away from me, started to play with his compute- me still patiently waiting next to him. Then I broke the silence by asking how i could get help. Mr. Handsome was still too busy with his computer, didn't even want to look up and sharply respond ""Front door!"".It was 3:00 April 3rd!Bye PF Chang's!",92122
14,"4540 La Jolla Village Dr San Diego, CA 92122",Jason H.,"San Diego, CA",5/9/2021,1,So we decided to do take out from PF Chang's this Mother's Day for dinner.  I wanted to go a little lighter so went with the Salmon Cesar.  What a let down for the cost of this dish. The salmon portion was extremely tiny.  I've had pieces of sashimi bigger than what was provided in this order.  What a severely overpriced easy to lose my business ever again. Not sure how any reasonable business can serve that and think someone would be satisfied with the price to value.,92122
15,"4540 La Jolla Village Dr San Diego, CA 92122",Min-Ru G.,"San Diego, CA",12/8/2020,4,"I was already hungry after work and the traffic delay on the way to P.F. Chang's for dinner with the parents did not help at all. Thus, we ended up ordering a whole ton of food which we ended up packing up for tomorrow's lunch and dinner.The items we ordered: the Happy Hour Steamed Dumplings, the new Thai curry dish (delish over rice), Hokkien Street Noodles, Ma Po Tofu, Pepper Chicken, California roll, Lobster-Avocado roll, and a side of Long Life Noodles. We ordered the steamed dumplings but they erroneously gave us the pan-fried dumplings; they made up for the mistake by giving us a second order of dumplings, steamed this time. The dumplings tasted delish. The dumplings were medium-sized, and each order consisted of 4 dumplings. I've always liked the tofu part of P.F. Chang's Ma P.O. Tofu; I allowed myself to skip the broccoli part since I already ate that veggie the day before. Really liked the new Thai curry dish on white rice. The sauce for this dish is delicious! Would order this again!By this time, I was already full but I had a taste of the Hokkien Street Noodles and the Long Life Noodles. They used rice noodles for the Hokkien Street Noodles. These aren't my fav noodles but they did a great job of making the dish. There was just enough moisture to I liked the Long Life Noodles but I wished they had added more noodles or cut back on the sauce. The sauce tastes good but in a limited amount. Also, the sauce was way more sweet than spicy. Overall, this place serves good food and they've done a good job in cutting back on the salt content.",92122
16,"4540 La Jolla Village Dr San Diego, CA 92122",Jihn S.,"San Marcos, CA",7/24/2021,1,This used to be a really nice place to go and eat. Now its old and needs a renovation. Not to mention the staff just does not care anymore. I also don't think they adhere to any covid standards as at about 3am after eating there I got really sick. Won't ever be going back there again.,92122
17,"4540 La Jolla Village Dr San Diego, CA 92122",Carmen C.,"Santa Ana, CA",2/27/2021,3,We ordered the pick up option of the Coconut Mojito and Organic Agave Margarita... the 4 for $30... this is what we got! Small containers that barely filled a tiny cup full of ice! The Coconut Mojito is really good but we got such a small amount. We ordered the Hot And Sour Soup which was just ok but they didn't pack spoons for us??? Knowing it was for pick up! Don't get the cocktails to go it's not worth the money!!,92122
18,"4540 La Jolla Village Dr San Diego, CA 92122",Wendy D.,"San Jose, CA",8/28/2020,4,"Regardless of the association of PF Chang's with not making authentic Chinese-American Food, this location is particular has gotten me through a lot of tough times as a student. I even had an unhealthy obsession with PF Chang's for a good couple of months! This location is probably my favorite out of all the ones that I have been to, despite the disgusting parking situation (You can park across the street at UTC and walk over or street park by the neighborhood) and overpriced food. But, it tastes great and was close. To-Go: When you order to-go, you simply just walk into the restaurant and tell them that you want to order something to-go and they will make the food, package it, put it in a bag and you're on your way! I usually order in advanced online so I could just arrive and pick up the food (which comes out just as hot; however, the portion is a bit smaller than dine-in). Dine-In: There's usually a bit of a wait (unless you're dining at an obscure time). The waiters are pretty attentive and usually check a couple times after they have brought the food. My favorite dishes are: any of the soups, the fried rice, and the kung pao chicken.",92122
19,"4540 La Jolla Village Dr San Diego, CA 92122",Jordan W.,"TX, TX",7/19/2021,1,"My family and I came to this place and were treated very rude by the manager/server (Adrian)and waitress (Aphril). We told the manager that the whole table was not served food. The manager did not apologize, nor was he willing to compromise. Moreover,   a black group next to us were also treated unfairly. It goes to show that there was inequality for others.  I would not go to this place ever again because the service is terrible. I would give this review 0 stars if I could. I would have liked an apology or a full refund for our lack of service on 7/17/21. This is a terrible restaurant. I with they had a more welcoming environment.",92122
20,"4540 La Jolla Village Dr San Diego, CA 92122",Mimi L.,"La Habra, CA",1/2/2020,4,"We just love it that there is a P.F. Chang's everywhere, after a few days of excessive drinking we were in seriously need of some hot & sour soup. This location is right across from the Marriott we stayed at in La Jolla. We could've just walked but both hubby and I weren't feeling well. I ordered a Kirin draft but didn't finish it, so I really wasn't feeling all the well cause no way I don't finish beer! For good we had hot & sour soup, beef Lo mein and Kung pao chicken. Food portions are always huge at Chang's and the flavors are so rich and comforting, best hangover food for us! Too bad I was getting sick too so I didn't eat much except the hot & sour soup. Our server was friendly, attentive and fast, glad that we got our upsetting stomach settled down a bit before driving back home! Ps. Valet was $6, so if you stay at the hotels nearby just walk here!",92122
21,"4540 La Jolla Village Dr San Diego, CA 92122",Nina S.,"La Mesa, CA",5/12/2021,1,"My husband made reservations here for Mother's Day. We loved PF Chang's but haven't gone in a long time because of covid. The food and the service was horrible. We were so disappointed and we will most likely never go back. We had to ask to order drinks after being seated for 20 minutes. We had to ask for refills a few times because our writer kept disappearing and forgetting .She finally brought us  a water after we kept asking and it had paper stuck inside on the bottom of the cup and the water was cloudy. We told a different waiter and she replaced it with a clean glass and clear water. My son got apple juice but it was warm and not even served in a cup. She gave it to us just in the bottle it comes in. I asked for a  cocktail that I didn't get till I was already eating dinner. When I ordered the cocktail she said oh we didn't have that drink I said it's on the menu and she said let me see... like if I was lying. After she looked at the menu she said oh okay. The menu is not the same. For appetizers we always ordered the green beans and calamari, our favorite. She brought us the wrong green beans we asked for spicy and she brought fried. She took the fried green beans back and gave us the spicy green beans. Even though we didn't eat the fried green beans , we were still changed for her mistake. My husband said it's okay, it was only $9  so we didn't say anything. They changed how the calamari is served and added veggies with it, which was okay but we had way more veggies than calamari, the sauce was not even close to the sweet chili sauce they had before. We were so looking forward to it. I hate that they changed it. We had asked for extra sauce and never got it. My husband ordered the salmon and it was so dry, he took one bite and said never again. I ordered the combination fried rice, with no pork, one of my favorites at P.F. Chang's but there was barely any meat., it was pretty much all rice. We spent about $85 and still gave a tip. The place wasn't even that busy so I don't know why everything was so bad. My husband apologized to me because it was not a good Mother's Day dinner but it wasn't his fault. Attached is a picture of my husband's water with paper on the bottom of the inside.",92122
22,"4540 La Jolla Village Dr San Diego, CA 92122",Paige A.,"San Diego, CA",1/20/2020,4,"I've been to a few PF Changs locations in the past, and this location is a solid OK. My boyfriend and I had a gift card so we decided to stop in.It was somewhat busy for a Sunday night, but we were sat right away. We waited a while for our server to come over to our table and were ready to order our whole meal. We ordered a cup of soup and the Mongolian dumplings for appetizer. My boyfriend had already finished the soup when the server brought over another order of it. We didn't order 2, but they let us have the second cup. The dumplings were okay, but not what we were expecting. For dinner, I had the Gf Chang's Chicken Lettuce Wraps, which has always been my favorite thing on the menu. My boyfriend order the beef and broccoli entree, but got the Mongolian beef by mistake. The server graciously corrected the mistake and apologized. We were not charged for the Mongolian beef, which was nice.Parking at this location is also not ideal. You can park in the Embassy Suites garage or valet. If you park in the garage, don't forget to have your parking ticket validated. Overall, it was a fine experience but not at the top of my favorite dinner spots.",92122
23,"4540 La Jolla Village Dr San Diego, CA 92122",Elizabeth C.,"San Diego, CA",1/5/2021,4,"We ordered takeout at P.F. Chang's and got the street noodles, honey shrimp, and Mongolian beef.  It was really good and the portion was huge so it fed three of us and fed one of us again the next day!  The chocolate cake was sooo delicious and even though it was huge we finished the whole thing.  Overall would go again though the noodles tasted strongly of curry which we were not expecting and probably wouldn't have ordered knowing that.",92122
24,"4540 La Jolla Village Dr San Diego, CA 92122",Flex Y.,"La Jolla, San Diego, CA",6/19/2021,4,"We like the fact that this restaurant takes special requests seriously. Mongolian beef was requested to cook medium rare and light on the sauce, came out perfectly to our taste. Most Chinese restaurant don't handle special requests well but PF is the exception.

Bryce's attention to detail and honest feedback created a wonderful selection of food and drinks. We felt like VIPs and our treatment was unparalleled. They care about their customers and the quality of their products and it shows. We will be back and passed several other PF Chang's on the way here! So worth it!,92122
26,"4540 La Jolla Village Dr San Diego, CA 92122",Daniel N.,"Imperial, CA",10/8/2020,5,There's so much I want to say about this restaurant but especially about the people working there. First I would like to congratulate anyone in charge of hiring  employees and the managers of this restaurant. Took my 12 year old daughter there last Saturday night for a father/daughter dinner. The manager that night was Hugo he went out of his way to make sure it was special every employee that worked that night passed by at least once and asked how everything was and if we needed anything. Again I congratulate everyone involved in the hiring process. People go to restaurants for the food but they return for the service and attention. We will return soon thank you again.,92122
27,"4540 La Jolla Village Dr San Diego, CA 92122",JD C.,"San Diego, CA",2/20/2021,1,"So let me start by saying I absolutely love PF Chang's , we come here often and out of the 150+ times I've eaten here this was by far the worst service I ever had at any restaurant!!! And that's saying something!so we go in and get seated and it takes almost 20 min to get our drinks, we then place an order for dumplings, and two entrees, we also ask for a patio heater as it was getting cold. 20 min later we get our two entrees but no dumplings and no heater so we start eating, we asked another 3 times for a heater (spoiler alert we never got a heater) nor did we get the dumplings that we ordered, what blows my mind is the table behind us had 3 heaters and two servers! so im not sure what it was about us but congrats PF Changs you just lost a customer due to your complete lack of service!",92122

Had a really nice date with my hubby.Fast forward Covid madness- restaurants shut down once again, only requiring to go orders and I am a huge believer in supporting local business and keeping their employees working!!! Ordered food for our family of 6. Drew took our order, he has such incredible customer service. So patient on the phone, answered all questions, gave great recommendations, assisted with using a GC we were struggling with on line, definitely a valuable employee. Food was once again incredible, even as a to go order. Highly reccomend PF chang's! 5 start food 5 star Drew 5 star customer service",92122
31,"4540 La Jolla Village Dr San Diego, CA 92122",Danielle G.,"Oceanside, CA",9/7/2019,3,"P.F Chang's is usually pretty packed no matter what time you go, so you would figure it's amazing. In my opinion that's not the case.I've gone a few times for dinner, but mostly come for lunch with my coworkers. The line is always out the door, but we don't wait too long to be seated and the hostess is usually always doing a great job. No problems there. The problems usually come after being seated. The last three times I've visited this location at least one item we have ordered was delivered incorrect. After discussing with the servers each time  it was determined every time that they put the order in wrong. The last time I was here, the server made my coworker feel like she ordered wrong, when in fact she didn't. She then admitted she was new and confused two items. A mix up is usually no big deal, but to have it happen three times with three different servers and then to have this server blame my coworker was a little bit much for me. I'm the type that usually always over tips even when service is bad and never complains. Good news is the dishes are always remade correctly, so they get kudos for that. The food is good, but definitely not above average. I used to always get lettuce wraps and liked them but got a little bored. Recently I have been getting the poke bowl and am much happier. The portion is pretty good and quality good as well. This is delightful considering this is not a sushi restaurant. Thumbs up for that! PF Chang's is your average chain restaurant. I think they could do just a bit more and would be able to earn a solid 4 star rating. I will keep coming back because it is convenient during the lunch hour and I can walk. I hate driving anywhere in La Jolla during lunch. Hopefully I'll be able to post an updated review sometime!",92122

Too bad you weren't our server from the beginning. More employees should carry the type of courtesy and energy that he has. So again, thank you. & as for the dining experience and service. The food was good. But service was sub par. Server was nice but lacked server knowledge and steps of service protocol. Management failed to move us when we asked our server if we could move tables due to the fact that they sat us under lights where it was attracting bugs (nats, mosquitoes)...I get it, outdoor seating is going to take its course but my girlfriend was uncomfortable and didn't want to finish her food so we took it to go and went home since we weren't locals of San Diego.

She didn't greet us when we first arrived. When she finally did it came across as, ""Are you here to dine? Stand over there."" The ""over there"" was essentially next to her, but no one was standing there. We moved to the right by 2 feet and just waited. She said nothing else to us. It was absolutely ridiculous. She could have said, ""hello, are you here to dine in or pick up? Oh, dine in - please stand in front of the other hostess desk and someone will be right with you."" But NOPE she was rude. So we waited and another gal with a lack of service skills barely greeted us and walked us to a table that was filthy. Food everywhere and floors sticky. We mentioned that it was dirty and she acted  surprised like she didn't see it. It was on the bench and floors. She wiped down the bench with no apology. SMH! Why a 3 Star? Our waitress Katelynn was amazing. She was happy, service oriented, greeted us and really went above and beyond. She also cleaned up the food left behind by the other girl who obviously doesn't know how to clean. If it weren't for Katelynn (hope I'm spelling it correctly) she saved the evening because I was about to ask for a manager. Food was good. The ambiance could be nice if it weren't for dirty tables, floors and chairs ... oh and rude staff except for Katelynn.",92122

I felt like the sushi was sitting out for a couple hours. Then, I shared the orange shrimp and black and pepper chicken. The black and pepper chicken was decent. Only reason I gave this 2 stars instead of 1. The orange shrimp was cold when it came out, and was pretty soggy. The chocolate cake tasted like it was baked from one of those $1 pre-made cake boxes and the chocolate fudge tasted store bought. In addition, the service was extremely slow and kept on forgetting to refill water or take empty beer glasses away. At one point 4 empty beer glasses sat on the table.

When it was time to order dessert I ordered the fire and ice dessert they put on a show but never brought me a fork 20 mins later when I asked twice and did bring one it was already to gross to eat.

The food here is served family style and comes with your choice of white rice or brown rice or you can do half and half! The Kung Pao Shrimp was crispy and had a pretty good flavor to it. The surf and turf was an interesting dish. It had filet mignon cubes with asparagus and roasted potatoes and also came with battered fried shrimp and lobster. It was alright - not much flavor there. The signature lo  mein was good! I love noodles and this hit the spot for me. All in all, it was a pretty good meal. Using the gift cards we pretty much got it for 50% off. Yay!

For myself I ordered a Caesar salad and opted to pay extra for salmon, this is by far the worst dish I have ever had in any restaurant tasteless dressing, all lettuce and croutons and I can't even call what they put on top a salmon. It was this dry chunk, the meat was white and no larger than my fork. Seriously? How can you charge people more than $15 for this salad? And extra for a nub of salmon. My wife ordered the broccoli and beef to share with the family and the portion of the food on the plate was to be shared with the table, only had enough for one normal person with an appetite, and too bad the beef was grossly dry and over cooked, we gave it back and had them bring us another.

Chang's regular, but after last night, can't say I'll go back anytime soon, at least not to this location.  The service and food quality has dramatically decreased.  Specifically:- was here on a Wednesday evening and they weren't very busy but our server just didn't seem to have time to spend with us; after taking our drink order and delivering an appetizer, chicken lettuce wraps, we never saw our server again.  In fact, we had to ask someone else if we could get our server so we could order dinner.- speaking of the Chicken Lettuce Wrap... the food itself has maintained it's consistent good taste.  But what ever happened to mixing the sauce?  The servers used to custom make the sauce to your order... if you wanted it a little more spicier or not so spicy.  It was just a nice thing having them mix it together.  Now they just give you a cup of some pre-made sauce.- Chang's Spicy Chicken - for starters... it isn't 'spicy' anymore.  This is one of my most favorite dishes and they've ruined it.  It used to be solid chunks of white chicken meat in a very spicy, but not too hot, sauce.  Now it's just chicken bits deep fried and covered in a sweet sauce.  And the portion, which used to be a plateful, is easily half the portion it used to be.  The larger portion they used to serve was nice because you could share this dish with the whole table.  But I'm really bummed that it's lost it's spicy taste and they don't use the big solid chunks of white chicken meat like they used to.- People need to learn to 'read' people.  We were deep in conversation when some guy wearing a tie comes over, interrupts us to ask how our meal is.  Frankly, he could have been someone from another table since he didn't even introduce himself.  Completely RUDE!!!  We are talking and trying to enjoy our meal and we have to stop to someone who just randomly walks up and starts talking to us.  To make it worse, we quickly answered ""fine"" and went back to our conversation but he kept interrupting asking us questions.  Assuming this person works at P.F. Chang's, here's some advice... if you aren't paying for my meal, leave us alone!  We are here to enjoy a meal and conversation and YOU are not part of it.  If you want to pick up the bill, then by all means, feel free to interrupt us and ask us stupid questions.- Valet parking - who are these people you hire?  The guy last night seriously looked like someone homeless and I was somewhat concerned about giving him the keys.  But what's worse is when I asked for my car back.  You charge $5 for parking (outrageous) and when I handed him $20... he asked me how much I wanted back!  Can't he do math?  Five from twenty equals fifteen!  Yes, I get it... he figures he will just go ahead and include his own tip into this... he parked my car thirty feet from the front door!  How about if the valet just gives me change and I will decide what and whether or not to tip.  And if I'm paying for the parking and pushed into tipping, then I can complain about the valet's appearance.  Clean it up!!!  The P.F. Chang's in Fashion Valley was much better the last time I went so I'll probably go there from now on if I want P.F. Chang's.  This place really needs to get back to the way P.F. Chang's started.*** Requested to send feedback via PF Changs website... however, that requires my email, full name, phone number(?!)  No thanks... don't want to be harassed by PF Changs.  Contact me here if you have questions.",92122

Generally I try to avoid this place like the plague just because parking is horrible and the place just gets way too packed during its peak hours. But I did learn that if you don't want to do street parking or valet, just park on the top level and then get your ticket validated and you're golden. Now onto the food. The restaurant is pretty spacious and the staff is a hit or miss. Sometimes they are attentive and other times, well, not so much. Today we had two because we were a larger group and both were friendly.  In addition, my co-worker wanted the ""room"" off to the side but the manager couldn't accommodate us so she comped some appetizers for us. Which is pretty awesome. She didn't need to but she did. So 5 stars for that manager!  The menu has a lot of options for everyone. Some of the items have higher price points than others. Overall, it's not bad but if some things are too expensive for the amount of food that you get. In any case, it's not surprising. I ordered the hot and sour soup. I swear this was better in the past. It didn't have much of a flavor. It was more of an egg drop soup than hot and sour. I was disappointed. I also ordered the salt and pepper calamari. This was good. Portion was good as well. Them little red peppers were spicy but I really liked this dish a lot.  I also ordered the street noodles. It was called Singapore noodles in the past and it was as good as I remembered it. There was a good amount of curry flavor. There wasn't a lot of shrimp or chicken. There was a lot of tomatoes for some odd reason. Overall the dish was really good just because the flavor was spot on. In any case, I would only go back if I had to. I'll just get some cheaper Chinese food elsewhere that has bigger portions and better flavors as well. No disrespect to this place. It's just not my cup of tea.",92122

They had a terrific drink/wine selection. We ordered the chicken lettuce wraps to start, and they were SO GOOD. I think next time I'll get those as my meal. When we got home I bought all the ingredients to try to make something similar, as they were just delish. We then ordered the crispy honey chicken and the surf and turf to share over rice. I think if I were to do it again, I'd skip the surf and turf as it wasn't outstanding (and for over $10 more than other menu items, I expected outstanding). The surf part (lobster and shrimp) left something to be desired with flavor as it was pretty bland. Our waiter was terrific, and the service left nothing undone. Overall a romantic location, with great food and drinks when you order right. We ended up wracking up quite the tab for a ""night out"" though.

Neither of us were super hungry, so we decided to share the calamari appetizer and get a large order of the wonton soup. It was the perfect amount for us - though the soup was mostly broth, and very light on the wonton.The calamari was very good - salt and pepper, very flavorful - but it was sadly very small. The soup was kind of bland, but it was warm and the few wonton that we got were at least decent. Throughout it all, the wait staff was at least pleasant and apologetic.

The lettuce wraps are probably the best item to order (surprise, surprise) followed by the Tuna rolls. Beware P.F Chang's is notorious for serving up dishes with a ton of calories. Unfortunately, I don't think the food is worth it. They validate parking, you can also part at the UTC mall and walk over.

118,"4540 La Jolla Village Dr San Diego, CA 92122",Carol C.,"San Diego, CA",8/26/2019,1,"I work at a law firm right next door to PF Changs.  We frequent the restaurant (dining in for lunch as well as having firm-wide lunches catered) because of the convenience.  The food is hit or miss, and the employees not very friendly.  If you are driving here, the only parking available is Valet for $6 plus tip.But last Friday's service takes the cake...I was going to be working late with a couple co-workers, we had not had lunch, so we decided to order some appetizers from PF Changs to tide us over.  It was about 4:30 and I knew that PF Changs had happy hour prices on appetizers between 3-6pm or so, so I walked over and when I walked in, the hostess was chatting to another hostess-looking employee.I told the hostess I wanted to order some appetizers to go, so she directed me to a cashier a few feet away.  She seemed annoyed I interrupted her conversation with her co-worker, but I asked her for a menu and she handed me a small printed brochure.  I opened up the print out she gave me, and I am not sure what it was, but it was not a menu, as only about 5 items were listed.  I had to go back to the hostess stand and once again interrupt the conversation going on between the co-workers, and ask for a regular menu.I decided the 4 or 5 appetizers I wanted to order, and was happy to see the reasonable happy hour prices since the regular menu prices are high for the food you get.  I told the cashier I wanted to place a to-go order, and then listed the appetizers I wanted.  She quoted me a super high price of $65 or something, so I asked 'isnt it happy hour prices now?"".She told me she could not ring up happy hour prices, but I could go to the bar (which was completely empty by the way, as was most of the restaurant) and order happy hour food to go from the bar.I have already wasted 20 min by this point, but I sit at the bar and tell the bartender I wanted to order some happy hour appetizers.  He had ignored me for about 5 or 10 min while he was doing absolutely nothing, and then literally THREW a happy hour menu down on the counter and asked me what I wanted to drink.  I said I didn't want any drinks, just food to go.  Then he tells me he cant do happy hour food to go.So now I have wasted about half an hour with this nonsense, of getting shuffled from one employee to the next.  This bartender was THE rudest, most surly bartender I have ever encountered.  Even if I wanted a drink, I certainly would not want to sit at the bar and deal with this guy, no wonder the bar was completely empty on a Friday afternoon.When I asked why I could not have happy hour appetizers to go, he told me that the point of the low priced appetizers was to have people sit there and drink, not to take the food to go.So I got up and went back to the cashier and ordered $45 of 'regular' food to go.It honestly would have been less expensive if I sat at the bar or a table, ordered an overpriced drink and the 5 happy hour appetizers I wanted, and then asked for a to-go box.Would they refuse to give me a to go box???!!!The food then took another half hour to be ready.This place is THE SLOWEST, rudest, restaurant I have been to in a long time.   The food is fast-food Chinese quality, and the portions are not in line with the prices.There are a ton of restaurants right across the street in the UTC mall that are way better, way cheaper, and way friendlier.  And with the first two hours free for parking at UTC, you will also save by not having to pay for valet parking.Which is exactly where my co-workers and I will be going from now on.P.S. for the person that is writing the canned responses ""sorry we did not live up to your expectations and hope you give us another try"" for the last 10 bad reviews, you can save your breathe.  Your responses are all the same, no matter if the complaint is rude employees, long wait times, or mediocre food (of which I encountered all).  It sounds like you just copy and paste your prior response to a negative Yelp review so obviously you don't ""discuss with our crew"" what exactly customers are having issues with.",92122

Food was off as well with simple lettuce wraps kind of Blah.. 3 different soups and ALL OF THEM THOUGH TASTY WERE ABSOLUTELY ICE COLD when trying to get her to bring them back our server was no where to be found. Entrees were ok but nothing to write home about.  I've come to expect a bit more from PF Changs as I always consider them one of those chains that always gets it right.  Unfortunately in this case.. They failed miserably.,92122

It had been a year or so since I had been into the UTC PF Changs and for the most part my memories were pleasant of my last experience. We knew that we going to be in the area around dinner time and decided to make reservations assuming that it was going to be busy. We arrived right on time and were seated promptly, right in front of the kitchen. The table was a neat spot to sit, ringside for the hustle and bustle of a busy Saturday night dinner service. A food runner brought us over some water right away and let us know that our server would visit us soon to take our drink and entree order. This was the point where our experience started to take a turn for the worse. We waited a full ten minutes before our server came to take our food order, which at this point I was not upset because her section was kind of busy. I had the distinct advantage of being able to see her whole section from where I was seated near the kitchen looking out over restaurant floor.  Her section quickly cleared out and I got to watch her chat with her friends in the top left corner of her section at a station for a least ten minutes while arunner ran our app. We had calamari, it was very tasty! The food runner ran our entrees. The server never came over to check on our food or see if we needed anything, I would have loved some hot sauce.  At this point our drinks were long since empty and I'm mad. I watched her fill the old couple soda four times over in the corner and talk about their kids. We did get to see our server one more time before we ended our horrific experience ... she walked up to the table dropped the check and said "" you don't want anything else do you? Because here is you check?"" The complete and utter lack of attention paid to us was absolutely inexcusable. The server needs her walking papers. I would have better suited to have served myself, frankly I would have enjoyed my experience better Final thoughts Wow, just wow.",92122

But then, slowly, you started to change and get rid of all the things I loved about you.  First was the lemon pepper shrimp. Then the garlic scallops, then for reasons that I will never understand, you did away with Mooshoo pork.  It was the BEST THING ON YOUR MENU.  But alas, I stray and bring up the past.  The service at this location was great. Quick, friendly, and no complaints.  I had a coupon from their rewards program to use, and it was my husband's day off, so he met me here for lunch. It was well within my acceptable lunch hour, so that did earn them the extra star.  But the food, well, was lacking. My pepper steak was fine. Nothing fancy, but nothing I will crave like I used to feel for the mooshoo.  My husbands broccoli beef (we are simple folks sometimes, so don't tell me not to get what we did) was too salty and too gingery.  It was like the Panda Express end of night remainders that you always regret eating.  Go back to what made you so great, PF Changs I'm not the only one who misses Lemon Pepper shrimp or Mooshoo pork (at least I don't think I am).  Keep your friendly staff, but bring back the classics.  Please?",92122

We did and sat down in the foyer where a couple of other parties were waiting. I didn't catch his name, but I assume it was a floor manager who was very pleasant and asked the couple in front of us if they would like to sit out on the patio for immediate seating. They declined and he came around to ask us. We said yes since they had all the heaters fired up and it was a great decision. We were warm on a chilly night and had the whole area to ourselves - hubby said ""red flag"" since it's easy to be forgotten outside, but he was wrong.Our server, Greg, was excellent! He knew exactly when to come out, when to check on us and when to give us space. He was attentive, personable and friendly, and also had great suggestions for our meal. Everything was spot on!

My wife and I swung by here on Saturday afternoon for a late lunch, did the obligatory valet (he just left it parked in front), and we were seated immediately. Our waitress was a cold and pushy middle aged blonde lady who seemed upset that we were eating so late. We were among the only people at 1:00pm, but that shouldn't change the deal. Really quite nasty with us. We ordered the Pepper Steak and Orange Peel Chicken lunch specials. Portions were very meager, but very tasty. The fried rice is always excellent here. Couple of iced teas and tip and we were out of there for 30 bucks- Not bad. Overall good, but I think I'll stick with the nice folks at the Fashion Valley location...

Still good but if you prefer the ginger taste and whatever alcohol you're drinking I'd go for just a mule (which he did order by the way and this was made but it's all good).Asian Pear Mojito- very delicious drink! Refreshing and not too strong or sweet. Sat at the bar. Got so-so service. Asked for happy hour menus. They told us there were none. Never got any. Bar tenders told us to their best guess what was on the happy hour menu. Got our food and drinks promptly but when the check came some of the items were not on the happy hour.

I absolutely love PF Chang's and have never had a bad experience with the food or the service, however today was not a good visit.  First of all we pulled up to the valet sign and stood there for almost 10 minutes and nobody showed up.  We asked an employee who was walking in where the valet guy was and he said ""oh we're not doing valet right now"".  I get why with the virus issue, but maybe you should take your sign down then??  We were seated right away, there was hardly anyone in there.  We ordered our drinks and mine was so tart that I couldn't even drink it.  We had to ask for straws 3 times and had to ask them to pull the shades down so we could actually see who we were talking to.  We had a waitress who was new, so I know she was trying, but a lot of things we needed were just common sense.  We got our apps and the crispy green were SO salty!!  But the lettuce wraps were good thankfully.  They also took a lot of their great items off the menu which was a huge bummer! Our food finally came but with no plates, so we had to wait to get her attention to bring some over.  We got the pork lo mein and it was very greasy and kind of bland.  The egg drop soup which is usually amazing was also very bland.  We asked for boxes when we were done (I guess they don't box it up for you like they used to) and she brought small little boxes, no containers for the sauces and nothing to put the lettuce in or a bag to carry it out with.  Again, I know she was new, but the restaurant was empty and those are basic items to remember.  All in all it was a very disappointing visit and the food tasted like they just weren't trying very hard.  It's ashame because my daughter and I love that place and their food, and we will go back again after the virus scare is over and hope that they can redeem themselves.",92122

Beef with broccoli was good, pad Thai was yummy, garlic noodles and dumpling soup were good too! My only reduction in stars was for service. It was really lacking and very disappointing.

Unless you are cool with parking on the street and walking a fair amount, I'm not. It's also pretty busy, since there are many businesses around the area. So if you're looking for something quick, this isn't it. Additionally, when I came in, the waiter got my order wrong. lol he heard shrimp when I clearly said chicken. I mean, it's cool, we all make mistakes, but it gave me a bad experience. Especially since I was short on time and my partner's meal already was served and was eaten before I even got my food. Sort of a bummer. The thing is, I ate here before and my food, along with all my friends, smelled and tasted of gasoline. So I really wanted to give this place a fair shot, because it must have been an off day for them. In the end, this is a restaurant I probably won't come back to again. Because in addition to the awful kitchen staff, my server never came back around to see if I needed anything, to refill my drink, or to give me my check when I asked for it.

Honestly i think P.F. Chang is really overpriced for chinese food that's not authentic at all. Which is fine, i get that this restaurant is americanized. and being a chinese and eating their food just drives me nuts.portions here are small! for $14 for a plate of noodles and all i got was a handful of rice noodles, a few pieces of chicken and shrimps but there were a ton of veggies: beansprouts, scallions, red cabbage, carrots. For those who likes veggies, this is a great dish for you. all the ingredients weren't cooked thoroughly -- there were still crunches to all the vegetables as well as the noodles. The noodles were not soften enough. I suppose this gives the feeling of ""freshness"" to the bite. the kung pow chiken was good but again, very americanized. ordered a small order of potsticker with pork. Literally the filling is just a blob of ground pork. not marinated, not seasoned with any ginger / scallions or anything that traditional dumplings should be like. If it werent for the soysauce and chili oil that comes with it, this appetizer is very bland! service though... of course is top notched.

We had to ask another staff member before the server in our section even thought to stop by or offer us water. After an hour and 15 minutes since arrival, we thought to ask our server if the food was ready. He said he would check on it. Here I was, about to be late for a 2pm appointment. I asked to cancel the meal if it wasn't cooked, I needed to leave.  What do you know? The food was already cooked. He just forgot to bring it to us. I bagged up the Chiang Mai noodles. Now it's the evening, and I just ate the meal that I begrudgingly didn't want to cancel and then waste. It should have been thrown out. Chiang Mai is a curry-noodle dish. Curry or noodles on their own are so easy to make delicious. How can a place claiming to provide high quality cuisine make an inherently good sounding dish have no appeal?I have consistently had this caliber of experience at this location, over the course of years.

Update: it is now 7:49 and I am still waiting for my food. The host apologized. The manager just came out and have me two free appetizer cards and a cheese cake. I appreciate her trying to fix it. They forgot my fried rice so I'm waiting again. They actually said that was done first and waiting on my chicken.

You can park in that first lot on the left and they will validate for you. Not my first choice, but if someone insists on going there, you can have a decent lunch. Our waiter Mitch was exceptional and informative as well as on top of things.",92122
182,"4540 La Jolla Village Dr San Diego, CA 92122",Krystle S.,"San Diego, CA",7/26/2018,2,I have fond memories 12 years ago of PF Chang's being the place to eat. I used to eat at the VA beach one all the time!My mil loves the lettuce wraps so occasionally I will bring her here. Tonight we came for that lettuce wraps and the wonton soup. I couldn't help my first notice the dirty woman's bathroom. It was nasty! Looks like it used to be nice (like 10 years ago) but now it's old and dirty. WTF PF Chang's? The restaurant was dirty also!The lettuce wraps were dry. The only good thing about them was the lettuce was really fresh. We ordered the wonton soup. The big bowl had 6 wontons said it was enough for 6 people! Yeah.. that's a lie. The shrimp in the soup was dry and nothing to ride home about. We also had the honey glazed shrimp. What kills me about PF Chang's now is the amount of fried noodles they give with a dish. It's pretty much all fried noodles and a little chicken for the lettuce wraps or all fried noodles and a little honey shrimp. I could of ate fried shrimp at home. The last thing that sucked was we asked for half white rice/ half brown. They gave us 10 percent brown rice and the rest white. The rice could of at least not Been dry. This place will be bankrupt on 5 years for sure. What happened to PF Chang's man??,92122

I just left the restaurant about half an hour ago and I feel sick like there was a ton of MSG in my food and I instantly feel it since I have a pretty clean diet,  this is awful I am never coming back here ever and oh my God do I feel so bloated, like I can't breath, heart racing, tired , needing so much water.

Unfortunately, the portion is small and you may have to order an appy to curb the rest of your appetite. We decided to order the chicken lettuce wraps which are delish! Very juicy, especially if you add the sauce they mix together.

About 20 minutes later we received our order, which looked delicious.  The eggplant was steaming hot (yes!), the Mongolian beef was lukewarm and not usually as crisp as we have had it, and the green beans were almost at room temperature and looked old and dehydrated.

I've been surrounded with all types of Asian food, and tried so many Chinese restaurants. There were many great ones, mediocre ones, and horrendous ones. Unfortunately, P.F. Chang belongs in between horrendous and mediocre. Many of my friends denounced this place as a really bad ""Chinese restaurant."" However, I tried to not let anyone influence my experience here. It was my family's and my first time here; we had a gift card, so we had to come here. The interior was very spacious and decorated well. We ended up ordering the Hot and Sour Soup, Orange Peel Chicken, Moo Goo Gai Pan, Mapo Tofu, and P.F. Chang's Chicken Fried Rice. Hot and Sour Soup: really really salty. Although the items in the soup were pretty good, the salty soup base made it very difficult to consume. Orange Peel Chicken: it was pretty good; best thing we ordered here. The chicken was tender. However, the portion was really small...it was like a serving for a kid's meal.Moo Goo Gai Pan: the only dish that wasn't salty! The chicken was also tender, and it was surprisingly pretty tasty. Try this if you want something not too salty.Mapo Tofu: I have no idea why they called this ""mapo tofu."" It was basically fried tofu on a bed of brocolli w/ some sauce on top. Mapo tofu should usually be unfried and placed in a spicy sauce, which is on the soupy side. I've never seen broccoli w/ mapo tofu. This dish's name should be changed to P.F. Chang's Fried Tofu or Fried Tofu w/ Broccoli. It wasn't that great. P.F. Chang's Chicken Fried Rice: it was just alright. Some of the rice were still hard. The dish was salty, yet again... Overall, the food was wayyy overpriced! For the amount and quality of food you received, it was definitely not worth it. The whole meal was salty...I drank 5 glasses of water during dinner! The food was about 1.5 stars, but the price of the food, just killed it for me. How is it justifiable to charge a tiny plate of Orange Peel Chicken for $13.95?!

How many Asian families do you see eating here?  How much you wanna bet my Father would remove me from his Will if I were ever to suggest we eat here? I couldn't find a single 4-5 Star review written by a Yellow Yelper. Yes, I've eaten here a few times, but thats only because it was for work-related lunches and dinners in which my generous Bosses pick up the tab on the company credit card. And if you think this food is ""healthy"", or ""healthier"", the American Heart Association reccommends not more than 1500mg of sodium per day. A lot of these dishes far exceed that: Cashew Almond Chicken 3780mg, Broccoli Beef 3260mg, Stir Fry Eggplant 3350mg...see all the sodium madness:pfchangs.com/images/Nutr…Despite PF Chang being overpriced, fake and bad for you(just like those bitches and douchebags), the gorgeous ambiance is good ""eye candy"", the food is edible, and the service is way better than at any real Asian restaurant. But this Yelper's Asian food dollars are always spent somewhere real, stinkier, and uglier on Convoy St...Spicy City, Sam Woo, Phoung Trang, Friend's House, Jasmine(for dim sum), etc.  And try dating someone for who they are in the inside too, not just the outside. Maybe you'll finally find true love. And real Asian food.",92122

We left confidently knowing we were in highly capable hands, and CONNER really ""got it right"" on everything. The day of the event, CONNER graciously (I will NEVER forget his kindness and consideration), closed off the room so we wouldn't be stressed out about stragglers taking up the tables as our event time approached), and he put the tables together mid-afternoon, so that we could set up the centerpieces and special place card bags at each place EARLY without hurrying and stress.  His calming presence did so much to ease my concerns and anxiety. We were missing a needed buffet table, and after he went into the office to make a phone call, a lovely and perfect large table magically appeared!!! Problem solved.  I see Conner as a young man who will go far up the corporate ladder in your organization.Throughout the event, CONNER was very present checking on our satisfaction and needs that came up, despite his other responsibilities managing the restaurant. I could not have asked for more personalized and attentive service.We clearly were provided your ""A-Team"" servers, as Connor promised. A tray of sake and cups were ready to go when our guests arrived. Nicole and Jenna tray-passed the sake per my request. Both Nicole and Jenna were highly professional both in presentation and attitude, well-prepared, pro-active, courteous, responsive, and quickly took care of every request I made throughout the event with a consistent ""can do"" and ""I'm on it"" attitude.""  They were on top of every course and were efficient and friendly from start to finish.The food came out on schedule throughout, was fresh and delicious (our guests raved about it), and was attractively prepared. Our servers worked around our little ""programs"" and speeches for my husband, who was 110% delighted with the entire experience. While Connor was dealing with a family emergency, we appreciated the other manager,  ANDREW AUEN (sp?)

Shrimp with candied walnuts...one of our all time faves! Pad thai noodles, never had this before, but would definitely order again.

The hands down winner was the salted caramel, followed by the red velvet.  The chocolate peanut butter crunch was very, very sweet.  Too sweet for me.Our waitress was great, but the food coming out of the kitchen was slooow and from what I remember is the norm from PF Chang's Bistro.I ordered a seasonal cocktail, the Crimson Spritzer.

My boyfriend had a gift card to use so we decided to give it a try despite the middle of the road reviews. Although nothing was terrible, I've had much better Chinese food with more reasonable prices and larger portion sizes at non-chain restaurants. The service was fine but there was a 30 minute wait for dinner on a Wednesday night.We were seated outside on the nicely decorated patio and the heat lamps kept the temperature comfortable on a winter night. If you're prone to getting cold easily, like I am, I would still recommend wearing a jacket though. My boyfriend swears by the chicken lettuce wraps, as do most people it seems, and I thought they were okay. I'm not a mushroom fan though and just knowing that there were mushrooms in the mixture tainted them for me even if the mushrooms aren't very noticeable. For our entrees were ordered the chicken lo mein and the Mongolian beef, two of our favorite Chinese restaurant dishes. As I said earlier, both were okay but I've definitely had better. The lo mein tasted fine but the quantity seemed very small. The plate barely looked half filled and while we usually have half the plate left over at other places, here we had a couple bites left. The Mongolian beef looked better in terms of quantity but the price ($17) is what set it over the edge. That's a good $5 at least over what I would usually pay for the same dish at a more authentic restaurant and the taste quality would be better elsewhere too. I'd prefer to eat at a smaller mom-and-pop type of Chinese restaurant but we still have some money left on our gift card so it looks like we'll be back once more.",92122

If you're going here to hang out with the hip young crowd, then this is your place. Not really my cup of tea! Plus it's really noisy here.Parking here can be tricky. You can either have your car valet parked, park on the street (nonexistent) or park in the garage next door and they do validate your parking here. Parking in the garage is hard to maneuver.

We also had the chicken lo mien (which my sister loves...I thought it was ok) and the lemon chicken which is another new add to the menu.

Four of us had dinner at PF Changs, and the ""spicy"" dishes were mild enough for my little granddaughter to eat, with the exception of the jalapeños. So where's the spice?! The food was definitely ""dumbed down"" for the masses. Two of our entrees and 1 of our side dishes had clearly NOT been made fresh for us. Instead, they had been made earlier, probably in a batch, and kept warm. They arrived at our table at a lukewarm temperature, and had poor texture.The Crispy Korean Chicken Wings for $10.95 were lukewarm and not very fresh, and they were a bit doughy, and definitely not crispy. Normally we should be fighting over these, but instead nobody wanted  to finish them. In the end, I told our waiter they were doughy, and they removed them from our bill. The orange peel shrimp for $15.95 wasn't as good as it used to be a few years ago. It was lukewarm and it seemed they had made it a lot earlier in a batch and let it sit around. The spicy green beans for $4.95 weren't very fresh either, and they were lukewarm as well. That's a total of 3 dishes which were unacceptably poor, and it would have been embarrassing to send them all back!!! )-; What happened to the standards at this PF Changs?The tuna tatake appetizer for $9.95 was tasty and fresh, and that is probably because they had to sear the tuna fresh per order. The large hot and sour soup was good and hot.This isn't the first time I've had a disappointing experience at this restaurant, but it will be the last time. There is no excuse for serving customers lukewarm food that has been made earlier and then sits around until it tastes like leftovers!!!!This PF Changs enjoys a good location across the street from the Westfield UTC mall, and near a hotel and businesses.  They get some customers due to their location, which is probably why they are still open.",92122

After 45 minutes how could the hostess not confirm with us if our table was almost ready or not. Instantly they brought us to our seat and there was about 10 other tables open in the restaurant.

Keep in mind, none of those words are big enough to describe how good this particular team from pfchangs was. I'll try and keep it short, but give you a quick synopsis of the tale of the tape. My mom had her retirement dinner ceremony hosted in the restaurants private room which was set up and built to standards that even emperor Trump would be proud to dine in. Very nicely done.  Food was perfect (naturally of course, I mean it's pfchangs, duh) and everything was executed in a timely manner and nothing felt rushed. After we paid the bill and everyone started leaving, I stayed behind at the bar to finish the playoff game on tv. Pretty much closing down the place, the only ones left were one table far off sipping coffee, in no rush to leave, the two bartenders,  one chick one dude, and the manager on duty, a very young dude, well put together, very sharp, probably in his mid 20's if I had to guess. Thinking I was done with my evening, paying out the bar tab, saying bye to the staff, walking across the street to my car, I noticed the poor city parking setup that my car had fallen victim to. (What was this, the automobile war draft?) I parked my car earlier along the curb with about 4 feet of curb in front of me before the red fire zone. Leaving Chang's  I find the car behind mine, and all the 13 cars behind it, a mere 4-6 Inches from bumper to bumper. (YES, 13 CARS ALL PARALLEL PARKED BUMPER TO BUMPER WITH NO MORE THAN 4 TO 6 INCHES FROM TOUCHING) Are these mofos planning to not move their cars until the car in front of them leaves at the exact right time? How the F is this so carefully orchestrated with everyone's consent?Now the crappy part. A huge sedan (I needed a more forgiving adjective to describe it so that I didn't have to use a bad word) backed upto my car with 6 INCHES from hitting my front bumper, all the while, his car being COMPLETELY into the red no parking curb.  10 feet in the red, 4 feet into the white zone next to my car.  IMPOSSIBLE to get out I thought.  I go back inside, wait at the bar, complain to the embassy suites hotel management team (which do nothing but give me the runaround) I sit back at the bar at Chang's  explain my situation, they see the exhaustion and discontenting anger I'm trying to keep within as I'm shaking my head in disbelief and mumbling new curse words to myself that I'm making up on the spot,  the bartender and server chick totally hung out and let me vent, all the while keeping me entertained and happy while I waited to parking, tow, whoever myself and the Chang's manager called that night for help. (Keep in mind, this was more horrible than I'm letting it come across) I waited nearly 2 hours, spent close to one hour on the phone with tow people, AS WELL as the Chang's manager dude on the phone trying from his house line, and also being on hold nearly 45 min during the dinner closing time at the restaurant. He really tried to help. I was stuck at the restaurant,  an hour from home, and it's getting close to midnight. No bueno situation. Then, the heroic bartender dude (all this guy needed was a cape) had the bright idea to make this car escape possible , and use his jumbo jet earmuff and orange light saber plane guiding skills, to help guide me out of the parking spot, in under 100 moves of moving a mere inch and a half at a time to wiggle it out of there and into freedom. I ask the young manager dude if it's cool that this guy go out there and help me, and the manager suggested that he go out and help as well so that each of them could supervise each end of the car. BOOM! I escape. In under 50 moves lol. Freedom and nightcap here I come! Talk about going above and beyond, these two dudes are studs. I mean I was ready give up hope, and sell my body to the mean streets of la Jolla for the night. But these staff members of Chang's are the new justice league under cover. I'm seriously considering leaving my marketing job and hiring these guys to start a crew similar to The Italian Job team's line of work.In conclusion,  these guys are very much worth the time and thumb torture it took me riggt now to type all this over a cell phone, whilst getting glaring looks from my gf as she's decorating the Xmas tree because I in a robe on the couch not helping. (Good thing I can cook, and spiked her coffee with a good amount of Bailey's earlier)Go see these guys. Bring up the story at the bar, these boys (and girls) are the prime example to not only all Chang's franchise location' s staff members, but every restaurant  in existence, of what real quality service and levels of going above and beyond should be all about. Kudos Chang's team members. My hats off to you guys. Talk about using 'the power of one' P.s. the food rocks and the bartender dude really knows his tequilas. Go to him for recommendations.

I feel like everytime we go in here, it's right after work (aka peak dinner time/tail end of happy hour) and it *should* be super crowded and a long wait, but that's not the case! It is crowded, yes, but the staff here is extremely efficient and really makes the most of the huge space (I've counted three indoor rooms and a very large outdoor patio); they manage to do this without sacrificing good service, which is great. They'll get your order in for happy hour even if it's 10 minutes to 6, and they will bring the food (which tastes delicious, always!) out promptly without making you feel like you need to eat quickly and get outta there. Whether it's for a quick bite with drinks or a long leisurely dinner and dessert, I have always enjoyed the atmosphere and the whole experience at this PF Chang's. Our favorites: Asian Pear Mojito, Mai Tai, lettuce wraps (like everybody else, apparently, and for good reason), Crispy Honey Chicken, Dan Dan noodles.ps. You can park in the Embassy Suites lot located right next to the restaurant entrance, and get validated.",92122

We had the hot and sour soup, which was fantastic (but not authentic, it was the more commercialized version that is delicious). For apps, we had the green beans which were flash fried in batter and basically were fries but healthier. We also had the chicken lettuce wraps which I loved as well. For our entrees we had tofu pad Thai - better at an authentic Thai restaurant but would do for pf changs. My husband had changs chicken which is only one of their few non breaded/fried chicken options and was only ok. Dessert was delicious but 1-2 bites per person, would consider upgrading if you like dessert.Service was fast. Ambiance was nice with a booth and quiet atmosphere.",92122

If you're ever around from 3 to 6PM any day, they have a good happy hour including some of their appetizers and drinks. :)",92122

A few years ago I remember it being pleasantly spicy, slightly crispy on the outside, moist and tender on the inside. Now it's just kind of soft, and I taste mainly salt instead of spice. They also added celery a while back, which seems like filler.It's not bad, it's just not what I'd come to expect.

Idk why Kanye wasted his phone call in jail for this foodWe had a reservation for 8:30 PM, and we got there early. But it still took them a while to get our table ready for us. My sister and I were worried about their portions and we asked our server and he said something quite misleading. He said that the main entrees are quite big, but they were actually quite small! They could easily feed one person only, so my sister and I were still hungry after ordering only our shared one dish. Anyways, the food wasn't even that good. The service was subpar because they forgot some of the tables dishes and they gave my mom her hot sauce AFTER she was done with her food!Terribleish to mediocre service at best",92122
272,"4540 La Jolla Village Dr San Diego, CA 92122",Glenn W.,"San Diego, CA",3/31/2019,1,"First let me say, I've eaten at this restaurant many times over the past 25 years and had not experienced any problems. It was never spectacular, but good enough to get me to come back every couple of years. It's been about 3 years since my last visit, and this place has gone to the dogs! We went in a group of 4 to celebrate a birthday, but found this is NOT a place to go for a dining experience, rather more of a fast food eatery environment, but without the fast service or fast food prices. We paid close to $90 with no drinks or desserts, entrees being mostly in the $16-24 range. The service was horrible. The waitress never came back to ask how the food was until long after we had finished. We had to flag her down for more water. They did not clear the dishes, and at one point we bussed our own plates to another empty table to make a little extra room on our table. The longest we saw the waitress is when she was trying to sell us on some small custard dessert cups!Initially we were brought a small bowl of rice. That was gone immediately and we flagged down the waitress for another small bowl of rice. She then brought 2 large bowls of rice, most of which went untouched. What a waste! One large bowl or two small bowls would have been plenty. The entrée portion sizes are small, certainly not enough to get a 'full' feeling, unlike most other restaurants we go to. I guess they wanted us to fill up on rice. The food was very tasty and especially some of the chicken dishes and Mongolian beef were all good. When you pay $20 for an entrée, usually a good portion of that price is for the ambiance and service. We got only the food, and not that much of it!Prior to my visit, I registered on their web site by giving my name, phone no., email address, and birthdate, and in return they said I qualified for a complimentary chicken appetizer dish on my next visit. They told me I didn't even need to print out a voucher, just let the waitress know my phone number. I mentioned this to the waitress but she said they can't look up phone numbers. We went back and forth on this, but in the end, we did NOT get the free appetizer. I also tried to make a reservation online, but their web site did not take it. I tried 20 times. I ended up calling in the reservation. Their web site definitely needs some work.The seating was mostly old and broken. At first we sat at a booth with a broken back. It leaned backward too much so was useless for any back support. We tried to move the bench closer to the table but found both it and the table were anchored to the floor. We then moved to a table with chairs. The chairs had seat cushions, but when I sat down, the cushion was so worn out I sank right down to the wooden base, and no, I'm not overweight. It was like sitting on a wooden plank.  When leaving, I stopped in the restroom, only to find a pig sty. It did not look like it had been cleaned since the previous day! All in all, this restaurant seems to be run by a bunch of unsupervised minimum wage jean-wearing youngsters who act like they've never been in a restaurant before! Very disappointed, and left with the mind set of never going back. San Diego has too many good restaurants to waste time with the incompetent ones.",92122

We began with the Chang's spare ribs. You could tell after the first bite that the quality of pork was very poor. In addition, the sauce was so sugary and artificial tasting. Next we ordered the Mongolian beef, I think it was called Chang's spicy chicken and the Dan Dan noodles. The Mongolian beef was the best of the three. The Chang's chicken breading was extremely soggy and sauce once again was artificial tasting. The beef was actually crispy and had a decent flavor. Next the Dan Dan noodles was the worst of the three. The noodles were super soft and the sauce was very unappetizing. 2 hours after the meal I could not get off the toilet, and would not even return if the meal was free.",92122

So, it's pretty cool now you can go online to pfchangs.com and put your order online with your CC number. Then at the time you say just roll up - parking in the pick up parking and everything is packed up very nicely in a handle bag - they have your sign for your card and you are done. The whole picking up of our lunch today took 5 minutes inside the restaurant. They do a great job packing up the food & are very friendly. Lastly, they just gave me a Warrior Card this year (it just came in the mail) but I think you can go online and sign up for one and it gives you 10% off your meals for the year.

But it's been years since I have last visited this particular PF Changs. I usually eat at the one in East Chula Vista. Being in the Fashion Valley mall and having a craving for Chinese food. We decide to eat here.I know PF Changs isn't completely traditional Chinese food but more of a Asian-fusion. They have been doing it for a while though and been serving good food since then. It's one of the wife's favorite.They were one of the first to come out with lettuce wraps. Now everyone has them on the menu from Applebee's to some steak places. PF Changs does lettuce wraps the best though. We always start with that.Our server Amber was a doll. She was so friendly and took care of us through out our lunch. Besides the wraps, our server helped us with our drink order. I had the seasonal Summer Samuel Adams and the wife had a ginger vodka cocktail. The wife loved her cocktail. My beer was the perfect pairing with my lunch. Light, refreshing with hints of orange. Not as overpowering in orange flavor like some beers like Blue Moon.We ended up ordering sweet & sour chicken and broccoli & beef with white rice. It only took moments and our food was at our table. The wife and I also shared a cup of egg drop soup. The soup had a darker color than I expected but that was because they added mushrooms. The soup ended up being thicker than regular egg drop soup but had a great rich flavor.The orange chicken was good. Hot, crunchy, chewy chicken in a light tangy sweet and sour sauce. The broccoli and beef was also very good. Crunchy cooked broccoli with tender strips of beef in a thick soy sauce.Overall it was a good lunch. Service was great. Food was good.

For dinner we had the crispy honey chicken & singapore street noodles (both around $10 each), & the food was mediocre.

Sat at the table starring at our menus for about 20min and no waiter in sight. I finally had to get up and ask someone where our waiter was. Really?? I could expect this type of service at a hole in the wall on Convoy street but not at a corporate chain. Ordered the dynamite shrimp...came out cold and barely any shrimp. Mostly batter. This would probably have tasted 100x better had it been served hot. Kids meal are affordably priced I'll give them that much. No parking nearby so valet is a must....$7 down the drain.

Usually by the time it hits the table it's a little bit soggy. The hubby had his usual Mongolian beef. It was just a really good family meal. The space was unlike any other PF Chang's we've been to.

It was jam packed on the Monday after New Years at 5PM. We were seated quickly but it took some 20 minutes for someone to acknowledge us. The first thing I notice was how tightly packed the place seemed to be with people. There was barely any space between our table and the two around us. When our waiter finally came by, he didn't even apologize and didn't seem to know what he was doing. Our food took a long time as well. A different waiter brought our food, and he said he'd be back with plates. He didn't, so we had to get the attention of our own waiter to get plates. The whole time we were eating, no one came by to check on us. The food was really simple, but I guess that's expected from Crispy Honey Shrimp and Mongolian Beef. But it looked so much less appetizing on tiny plates. Despite this, we were hungry and finished most of our food. We would have definitely been pushed over the edge had the food not been decent.It took a really long time for our waiter (who had a large party of 10 or so in front of us) to notice we were done. Luckily we had the card ready so he didn't take long with the check. Overall, this was the worst experience we have had at a restaurant. Definitely do not recommend this location. It's disappointing because we generally enjoy PF Chang's.Sidenote: we saw a lady call the manager. We don't know whether it was the food or the service but just something to keep in mind.",92122

It's pretty easy to get a reservation for a large group and they will also split the bill if needed. The food is good, but I think it is overpriced. I usually get the crispy honey shrimp or the shrimp with candied walnuts. The last time I was here, I decided to go for the entree size of the crispy honey shrimp instead of the lunch portion because the server said that  the lunch portion was 1/3 of the size of the entree (but you do get your choice of soup or salad with it). The price of the entree is about 50% more than the lunch entree. I was with a large group and others got the lunch special and the server was incorrect in stating that the lunch portion was a 1/3 of the size; it was more like 2/3 of the size of the regular entree. The salad that comes with the lunch special also was rather large, so I'd recommend opting for the lunch special rather than getting the regular entree. The shrimp still tasted good though, I just overpaid. Service is typically good, with friendly servers, but it has always been slow whenever I've dined here (even when it isn't a large party). They are slow in refilling your drink and also slow in bringing out the bill. If you plan on dining here for lunch during the work week, plan for at least 2 hours. Validated parking for the parking structure and valet are available. They also have a Warrior Rewards program. I signed up for it years ago and used to get free lettuce wraps, but they are ""revamping"" the program right now, so I haven't gotten any good rewards during this time (which seems like months if not a year). They also aren't accepting new accounts, but when they do, I'd recommend signing up.Although not my first choice, it is a good option for work lunches. I've heard they have a good happy hour as well.",92122

She handed me 5 menus and said we could seat ourselves. ?? The restaurant was at less than half capacity. Not sure why no one could seat us with the crowd of staff chatting by the bar. We ordered an appetizer soon after we seated ourselves. 10 minutes later the server came back and asked if we wanted an appetizer. Told him we already ordered one. He said oh, would we like to order more? One member of our party had to repeatedly ask for the cocktail she had ordered. After 10-15 minutes another waiter came to our table saying they were out of that particular drink and offered something different. Five minutes later he came back saying they just found more and could bring her the original order. When it was finally brought, it was warm instead of chilled. The waiter offered to bring her some ice. The food was delicious, but some entrees were lukewarm.The floor and table were sticky. The women's restroom was filthy with trash and dirt on the floor and a toilet that had over flowed. My husband said the men's room had puddles of urine. Three separate times we heard large amounts of dishes hit the floor.I understand that our original server was in training; but given the light crowd and what appeared to be far more than a full complement of staff; PF Chang's SHOULD have been spotless with impeccable service.

And to top it off they both tasted like crap.  The lo mein was way too salty or dry and the beef was way too sweet and chewy.It will be a long time before we return to this place.  Either I will have some gift cards to use or a craving for some good lettuce wraps for me to return.",92122

We were a table of five, and she always kept our waters full & provided information on how long the food would take up front (which we really appreciated - and the wait wasn't bad at all!).

It's kind of its own thing with its own distinct taste. Everyone I know comments on this. And,while the food is great, it really is, it has such a distinct taste that I can't go there very often or I get bored with it.So, if you've never been try it out. You'll probably love it.

This place is perfect for the people who are scared to eat at a real, hole in the wall place, or just want to feel ""fancy"" eating some Chinese food. So why did I come here? (lol) Because it's the only place my Americanized bf's family knows of.The only thing I really like about this place is the lettuce wraps. It's the best, but everything else is either really salty or really dry. I think this place puts more msg than a hole in the wall Chinese place. We did the dinner for 2 thing, the hot and sour tastes like it was all soy sauce, my bf's cousin said it tasted like a fisherman's shoe or something. It was way too dark for hot and sour soup. Not the best. I suggest you go with the egg soup. Everything else, mongolian beef, peppered beef, sea bass, lemon shrimp, lemon chicken, etc was either waaay to salty or waay to dry. Overall, it's like Buca Di Beppo but Chinese food. Mass-chain Americanized restaurant. I think it's better to go to a hole in the wall Chinese place, pay half the price, get half the service, and wait half the time, but you'll be satisfy. Ohh, but for HAPPY HOUR: I would come here just cause they have lettuce wraps for $2 off, and a good selection of cocktails. Only 3 beers though, but I haven't hit this place for happy hour yet!",92122

I chose the Buddhas feast stir fry which was 420 calories. Although it was no orange chicken or chow Mein, it was pretty good, although not very hot.

No way I'd manage like this with social media so relevant these days.The parking problem needs addressed by city. Our car was two disabled and a driver who had no handicapped sticker. Parked at back side of neighboring hotel in valet space because psrking in hotel parking garage was too far to be able to walk for some. Where we parked wasn't much better. At no time was valet available. We tried. What I said on their webpage:""So sad. Have gone with family a dozen or more times and they've gone even more and all was superior. Yesterday was worst ever. Set up lunch for 6 and from minute res made it was  made clear by me from hostess on how special this person and her birthday celebration needed to be. Disasters didn't stop, starting with parking. One appetizer didn't come until asking several times. When asked waiter said he remembered talking about it but he didn't write it on order. It came at end of lunch then was packed stupidly and would have been inedible. My lunch didn't come with others and waiter said it was being cooked. 6 checks later waiter admitted he hadn't put it in. Finally arrived as check being prepared. So I sat while everyone ate and wasn't about to make it worse by making my friends sit while I ate. Birthday dessert was delivered after manager came to table and it took telling her several times before it came. Waiter had already been reminded multiple times. To add insult waiter was nowhere all the time. Had to send other waiters to get him. He never once refilled our glasses or even checked or asked if we wanted refills or anything else. PF Chang's birthday girls favorite restaurant and had been mine. Later found she liked one in fashion valley I didn't even know existed. My plan to make her 86 birthday perfect was a disaster. I am in my 70s and for the first time ever in memory (confirmed by daughter) I did not leave a tip. Have always believed server deserved a tip always. Even if service bad because it's a hard job.

We had the Korean wings, the green beans, a chicken and broccoli dish and an orange peel shrimp, none of which were hot, and most were barely warm. The fried chicken wings tasted like they had been left soaking in their sauce for an hour, no crispiness left. And some of the dough inside tasted raw.

400,"4540 La Jolla Village Dr San Diego, CA 92122",Wanugee N.,"San Francisco, CA",8/23/2011,3,"This PF Chang's, that themed based formula restaurant chain out of Scottsdale, AZ (known for it's large immigrant Chinese population - not!) that adds sugar to nearly every Chinese dish and makes it look like Chef Boyardee made it, is on the edge of the upscale suburb of La Jolla, and amidst the high-rise business area just off La Jolla Village road. The street on the backside is called Executive, so that tells you that this is mostly occupied by business lunchers. Parking is limited to Valet mostly, another hint. And sure enough, we came for a business lunch, the three of us, and at 11 am there was nobody here. But by high Noon, there was a cacophony of gabbing, bottom line biz lunchers and boorish, gossiping and idle La Jolla LOLs (that isn't a texting ""Laugh Out Loud"", it is old school ""Ladies Of Leisure"" in this case).Our waitress seemed a little dazed, as if on Opium. Which reminds me that the British brought Opium from the fields of Pakistan, and sold it to the Chinese via Hong Kong for 100 years to get them hooked on something they needed, because the Chinese had nothing they wanted before that from the Brits, but her Royal Majesty's upper class clamored for fine Chinese Porcelain, Tea, and Silk. The British needed something to trade, so why not get them all hooked on dope, and voila, the trading company and Brits get rich off the imperialization of China!  Plus they wanted to beat the Russians, Americans, and French at getting all the spoils in the Central KIngdom, and since the Chinese wanted nothing from those other Low Fan, addictive drugs was a great choice by those English! So it is with PF Chang's, create a formula of making Americanized Chinese food in a large noisy restaurant with large statues of Horses and Ching Dynasty clay burial soldiers, raise the prices at least 50% over real Chinese dishes, and hire young Caucasian waitresses to ask their white male business counterparts if they would like their ""sauce"" spicy or not (Uh, you mean with the 3 ""sauces"" I can find in any Chinese diner, Soy, Vineager, and Chili Sauce?).Bo Hau, Hsieh Hsieh Ni. No thank you, I would like to make my own ""sauce"" concoction. After our waitress suggested 3 times in a row if we wanted to start with the lettuce wraps, we acquiesced and order them. They weren't bad, but it went down hill from there. My Mapo Tofu, a dish you can order in virtually any CHinese restaurant whether or not it is  on the menu, was dried and look like it came from a microwaved frozen dinner from Chung King. I might tell you this is a good place to bring your Bai Gui business relationships for lunch, but it is too noisy to have a conversation without yelling. At least that part is a little more like going to a real Chinese restaurant for a Cantonese banquet, where everyone seems like they are yelling and you can't hear yourself think!",92122

The eggplant dish was miserably over-thickened almost to the extent of Jello. Otherwise, it would have been good because the sweetness and spiciness were well balanced.The shrimp in lobster sauce should be called shrimp in plopster sauce because, again, it was over-thickened. Also a little plain. A hint of fermented black bean, which was nice but otherwise pretty watery. Not creamy, like I imagined, and not a hint of lobster.The one winner that never disappoints, though, is the shrimp with candied walnuts, honeydew melon in creamy sauce.

Nice, themed decor and clean bathrooms...and that's about it. I've given this place several chances already yet on each occasion, they've still failed to impress me. The service is a joke here. It's inconsistent. The servers are friendly, yet they seem to disappear after they've delivered your meal. My team and I come here for lunch quite often only because it's right around the corner from our office. We've had the same server a few times. He is absentminded - a bit aloof, and does a poor job of describing the dishes. Come on, dude, it's your job to sell me! I can't say this is the case for all of the servers who work here, but damn, can we get seated in a different section next time?Onto the food. I ordered the Moo Shu Chicken today for lunch and it was terrible. While the dish looked promising, it was too salty and all I could taste was soy sauce. The only thing that I could do to make the dish a bit more edible was squeezing 5 lemons into it. Blech.I've also had the Chicken Chopped Salad. I guess you can never really go wrong with a salad that consists of only mixed greens and grilled chicken, but the dressing it comes with is bland and tasteless. My quick fix? You guessed it - 5 lemons. I would actually order this salad again. Well with the side of lemons, of course.Here is the list of items I've tried off the menu:Egg Drop SoupHot and Sour SoupWonton SoupSeared Ahi Tuna Sweet and Sour Chicken Moo Goo Gai PanAlmond and Cashew Chicken Chicken Lettuce WrapsSpicy Green Beans Spinach Stir Fried with Garlic Sichuan Style Asparagus Shanghai Cucumbers Oolong Marinate Chilean Sea BassLuckily, we get paid lunches where I work. If not for that, I would not be throwing my money away here. I wished my company would pay for my drinking habit however. Ah, I just had an idea. I'll suggest PF Changs for Happy Hour!

Initial contact with our waitress was good and our drink orders were taken while we perused the menu.After our drinks were delivered and orders taken, the experience started to go downhill.Disappointed in the delivery of our orders. 3 people in our party received their food initially, but the other 2 people in our party had to wait several minutes (about 5) for their orders to arrive. This was either a problem in the kitchen with the sequencing of the order prep, or the wait staff not waiting until all orders were ready to be delivered. Regardless - it led to several minutes of uncomfortable waiting at our table while those who already had their food had to wait for everyone else's orders to be delivered.The food was great, but we needed to get all our orders delivered at the same time (or very close).

They made sure her dish was handle carefully without possible contamination. The way they handle my mistake was first class. We apologized for not letting them know at the time of the order.

Chang's is the quality of their meat.  Regular...or ""authentic""... Chinese restaurants use really poor quality meat but P.F. Chang's has non-fatty meat that makes me much more comfortable eating it.My favorite dishes are:  Chang's spicy chicken, Mu Shu pork or chicken, Kung Pao chicken & the Singapore Street noodles",92122

This used to be one of my truly favorite restaurants.  I don't get to go often because my wife isn't big on Chinese food, but every so often she takes mercy on me and I get my wish.So on that rare occasion, I walk into PF Changs ready, to eat some great food in some good atmosphere, with what I had become accustomed to.  Well holy smokes, they have gone downhill in a big way, and in a hurry.  Let me count the ways.'1) The menu- totally re-done and not for the better.  Fewer options, nothing new, nothing seasonal.  Used to be some 3 of 4 different kinds of dumplings/pot stickers...not any more.  2) Decor-- this particular location got re-done... Going for fancy I guess since they are in the UTC area???  But it is so dark and loud and mehh.3) Service-- and maybe it was just this particular night, but we walk in on a Sunday night at 6 pm.  The Chargers have a home game, thinking it should be pretty quiet... but not.  45 minute wait for a table... so we sit at the bar.  Bartendress could not have been less friendly.  Service was slow.  No customer service at all.4) Most importantly, the food stunk!!(a) appetizers-- pork dumplings used to be great, these were just OK.  No one made us the nice sauce they used to make for you.  Instead these came pre-soaked.  They used to serve them so nicely in the little metal thing and they were so much fresher and better.(b) entrees-- I specifically go to have the Kung Pao Scallops there- so good.  Not this time.  When the guy brought it out he handed me the plate and said ""Kung Pao Chicken"", I said nope, I ordered the scallops.  He looked closely (its really really dark in there even at the bar) as did I.  It was impossible to tell... they had deep fried the protein in this dish so much, it was impossible to distinguish chicken from scallops.  Usually the scallops are just flash fried, but these were like chicken nuggets.  Also, the dish was FULL of celery... tons and tons of celery... Usually there is no celery in Kung Pao, it is not mentioned in the menu description.  My wife's dish was full of celery too, apparently they must have just received a large celery shipment and were including heaps of it in every dish.I sincerely think the lead chefs had the night off to attend the Chargers game and our meals were cooked by the janitorial staff or something.  We also both experienced digestive issues the next day.  PF Changs, I once loved you.  But you are off the list.",92122

Purchased dessert and took care of the waitress who was very nice through whole process. Waitress even came over and said everything was covered thank you for coming in expecting not to get any tip out of it. She was a very hard worker and hope I showed my appreciation. Thank you for making a uneasy situation .. awesome ! Thank you",92122

But today was unlike any other visit I have had in the past. Had the sweet and sour chicken with brown rice and a side of broccoli. Felt a little nauseous about 4 hours later while at work. When I got home didn't feel so good. I laid down and immediately had to run to the bathroom. I look in the toilet and there laid my lunch. I laid down again. And the scene played again. Throwing up back to back. I hadn't eaten anything since 12ish at the restaurant. I decided to call and speak with a manager (Melissa) to inform them something clearly wasn't right in the kitchen. She was unsympathetic and said she would let the cooks know. She took my information and hung up. Wow!!!! I will NEVER visit this restaurant again and I'm telling EVERYONE I know BEWARE: DO NOT GO TO THIS LOCATION!,92122

True to its packaging its large and contemporary decor - a good mix of east meets west style, however it was super noisy when you enter. Felt more like a loud sports bar than a nice restaurant. That was my first turn off. Secondly I had to wait for several minutes before any of the 5 seating hosts noticed me. That was absurd!! There was no one else waiting to check in (I had reservations too) and there were 2 screens to check in and 5 people standing around them, two of whom made eye contact with me yet did not acknowledge me standing there waiting to check in. Blew my mind!! I know I'm petite but cmon!! Well eventually they checked us in and we got a table. Our server was really friendly and did her best to make me forget my jarring entry experience so kudos to her for that. I also appreciated her taking my order for an old favorite of theirs which is currently not on the menu anymore - the awesome garlic noodles, and voila I got my wish for it. Hubs got the Buddha delight and we both agreed that the old classic garlic noodles is still better than newly inspired menu additions. Also to note was for the family friendly restaurant I did not notice a baby change station in their restrooms. Maybe they have another restroom with a set up but the main one by the front door I didn't see anything. Just an FYI for families heading there! And there were several families!!",92122

I had not eaten there in over 1 year had the displeasure of returning last week. I won't go into a big rambling story but in a nutshell the new prices were ridiculous the food tasted horrible and like a salt mush fest..the new asian lobster tacos were gross... I wouldn't feed them to my dog and the service was horrendous great job PF...fail.  also the waiter was the worst... inattentive not trained correctly they don't give one crap about their service anymore. I even told the hostess in the restroom and she just laughed and said I know when I told her about the waiter.,92122

Chang's and I can't say that I was totally impressed... the hostess were very helpful and sat us even though we were early for our reservation. The first seat they offered was right but the kitchen. I work in the restaurant industry and I didn't want my dinning experience to remind me of work, so I asked to move seats. They helped out right away. After we got our new seats the experience went a little down hill. We ordered drinks and an appetizer and after for a few more minutes we were ready to order our entrees... but our server failed to come talk to us. She even passed our table taking away our menus without a word. After eating out chicken lettuce wraps the server gave us dinner plates... but still never took our order. 45 minutes later a different server, whom we didn't see before asked if we were okay. We told him that our server forgot about us. He placed our order which tasted GREAT!! But again our original server walked right past up. She then came up and instead of saying sorry for forgetting about us asked if we wanted the check. We proceeded to pay but still had our drinks to finish. I pre-bussed all of our finished plates at the end of the table so we could finish our drinks in peace. Our server reached over our drinks and arms to grab the check. This is was bothered me the most. Why take the check that's between us but not the plates at the end of the table.... she never said sorry or more than a few words to us. Our whole meal ended up being 2 hours!! It was embarrassing. I understand if you are training but some acknowledgment would be nice. Great great food but a sub-par experience.",92122

We were the only table outside so I decided to mention it to my waiter that if being outside would be a problem we'd be happy to move inside, he assured me it wouldn't. Needless to say everything got better after that!As an appetizer we ordered lettuce wraps and egg rolls, good gracious! The appetizers tasted amazing!

We did come in a little late in the evening so maybe the server was tired after a long night but he could have been a little more attentive.The location is decent.

I mean, you can't really go wrong with their food, but they serve very little proportioned entrees so be prepared to order 2 of the same entrees if you're with a group of 3 or 4.  The food is definitely overpriced.On busy days, you'll find yourself having to look for parking on the street or you can take the easy route and valet.  There is also a parking garage on the side, but I'm not sure if that is only for the hotel next to it.Whenever I come in, I usually head to the bar.

We came for lunch here today and it was beyond great. As expected, the place was fully packed and very crowded. However, the wait was only about 10 minutes for a table of 2. I must say, for being so busy I have never seen better or more attentive service at rush hour. We ordered the fried green beans, steamed dumplings, lettuce wraps (of course), hot n sour soup, and the chicken pad thai (which was a new menu item). Everything was delicious as expected. The lettuce wraps were of course great, the green beans are one of my all time favorites, the dumplings are prepared differently now and I was impressed, and the chicken pad thai was full of flavor! I normally stick to my usual, which is the mongolian beef, but I thought why not try something new and I was pleased with my selection.The wait for our food did take quit a long time (we didn't mind at all - they were super busy and we didn't have anywhere to be). Me and my mom were enjoying our quality time, but our waitress Stephanie insisted on complimentary dessert! We ordered the salted caramel cake and it WAS DELICIOUS. Small enough to split for 2 and enough to satisfy our sweet tooth. Also, shout out to our waitress Stephanie! She was very attentive and provided impeccable service! I will definitely be back and hope I have her again!P.S. The La Jolla location just went under a renovation and the place looks great. I love it! There are now community tables in the bar area and the place just seems more spacious. The old decor seemed dark and crowded. We will be back soon and can't wait!",92122

They grabbed a table and ordered an appetizer and I got there just in time to order. When I sat down the waiter came to the table and asked if we were ready to order but never asked me if I wanted a drink. We ordered lettuce wraps to start off with which are always delicious and then we ordered four entrées to share. We waited for our food for probably around 15 minutes, which I would say is fairly normal for an early Friday evening. The lettuce wraps however came out in the middle of our meal instead of before. Unfortunately, our waiter never asked if we wanted brown or white rice so when our entrées came we didn't have any rice at all so we had to ask the waiter in training to get some. All around the dinner service was kind of chaotic. Waiters were running into each other, they were dropping utensils and plates and the restaurant wasn't even at 50% capacity. I don't know if they were just all having an off night but it was a really un relaxing experience. Despite not being the best waiter in the world he was a really nice guy. To my dismay, they remodeled the La Jolla PF Changs and it's kind of disappointing because I really enjoyed the ambience before with the red barrel lights it was a little darker, more romantic and I feel as if they have altered that into being a more modern and hip place.. which when you go to PF Changs you expect to be in a more Asian type environment; considering it's a Asian bistro.... But nonetheless the food was good and we went on our merry way. If I had to choose between the Carlsbad and UTC location I would hands-down choose Carlsbad.",92122

When I go out, I want food that I couldn't make myself. The chicken lemongrass pot stickers were a decent appetizer and the filling was pretty yummy. We ordered off the lunch menu. I got the pepper beef, which was drenched in this odd salty sauce. It was just so salty that I couldn't finish the rest of the beef after the rice was gone. My boyfriend had the opposite problem, his lemongrass grilled chicken was under seasoned and a bit dry. Service was nice. Our server was very friendly and he tried really hard. The place was somewhat busy for the lunch hour rush, so unfortunately we had to wait a bit long before ordering, getting drinks, and getting refills despite reminding him.

Each time I also started off with the chicken lettuce wraps as I'm sure everyone and their mother does. Of course, those are their specialty (yes, chicken on top of leaves of lettuce; revolutionary). First time I had the shrimp with candied walnuts. Those candied walnuts will dress up just about any food dish and make it seem worth a million bucks, but it's not.

The spicy tuna was barely OK, nothing special, but the crab wontons were so unpleasant-tasting that I couldn't finish them. It was like biting into, and chewing, wet, microwaved cardboard.

On this visit, we were here for a soccer tourney and wanted The Little Foodie to experience this place. Yes, we have one in Hawai'i, but we don't eat out often, so we've never brought the family here. He thoroughly enjoyed it. We ordered the Tuna Tataki Crisps and the Flaming Red Wontons for our appetizers. Boy, did that whet our appetites. I think we could have ordered appetizers only and been happy. For our dinner, we had Chang's Spicy Chicken and Crispy Honey Shrimp. The chicken was not spicy at all, so I was a little disappointed. The shrimp was also tasty, but the flavor profiles were a little too similar for my taste. Next time, I'd like to order the Dynamite shrimp and something with veggies. I was, however, with my carnivore hubs, so I ordered lots of protein. The service was friendly and attentive.

My first experience at P.F. Chang's was about 5 months ago with my roommate and we sat in the dining room.  The food was good; however, our server was young, new, very slow & very scattered - but I didn't hold it against him as I was in the restaurant industry for nine years so I understood. A couple weeks later I went back by myself, this time I sat at the bar where 3-4 guys were working the bar.  It took at least ten minutes to even be greeted, and it was all downhill from there. Eventually I ordered the same thing I always get - a water with lemon and the chicken lettuce wraps.  I chalked this experience up to ""maybe they were just having a shitty night"".  I didn't return again for a couple months, but eventually did - again, around the same time as usual (5ish) and 3 of the same male bartenders were working. I sat at the end I'd the bar by the cash register, once again AWFUL service!  These three guys were carrying on conversations amongst themselves laughing and cutting up, completely ignoring me (and I was literally 3 feet away from them).  It was at least ten minutes before I was greeted only after I curtly said ""excuse me"" to get their attention redirected. Even after handing me a menu it took 5-10 more minutes to get my water and place my order of my usual chicken lettuce wraps.  Once again, not ONE time was I checked on in 45 minutes of being there, my glsss sat empty for 20 minutes, and right before I left another gal sat next to me...I made it a point to wish her luck in getting service, and as I walked out the valet guy greeted me and asked me how dinner was. I told him food was good, service was horrible as usual.  I didn't have any intentions of ever returning, however, I'm clearly a glutton for punishment!!  Let me add - I'm not from here, I work all the time, and this place is very convenient to where I live. Well, it'd been another couple months and I was craving chicken lettuce wraps...oh, and it just so happens that tonight is my birthday. Why.did.I.bother??? I haven't a clue as it was just another repeat of the last 2 times I sat at the bar - absolutely awful service, it was like the situation was just on ""repeat"" mode.

Better off going to a real dim sum restaurant. Something this P.F. Changs really needs to work on is keeping their booth seats cleaner!

545,"4540 La Jolla Village Dr San Diego, CA 92122",Rob P.,"Orange County, CA",7/26/2010,2,"P.F. Chang's is like the Chili's of asian food. Why does everything taste like it was furiously rubbed against the wall of a salt mine? I don't mind some sodium fueled cuisine, but these plates could single-handedly give you kidney failure. The inside of the bistro is decorated with these monolithic horse statues, a few nondescript stone representations of people, and other similar rock carvings; it looks like they used Medusa as an interior decorator. Lucky, though, if you have an arch nemesis sitting next to you, there is a likelihood that you could just push a statue over on top of him.Everything is pretty expensive on the menu, so be prepared to bring a satchel of greenbacks when you arrive. The Mongolian Beef I ordered was fifteen dollars, and the portion could have fit on a petri dish. The beef was so gelled with spices I couldn't tell if I was eating meat or just a congealed glob of fermented sauce. The rice that accompanied my meal was wonderful though!Also, the bartenders here are confounding. If you order any specific drink, even the house ones, they let the flood gates go on the soda water and put roughly one splash of alcohol to chase it. If Sam Spade existed, he would slap these guys.If you're in the mood for fake asian cuisine set to the set design of Clash of the Titans, I say indulge yourself. P.F.

Chang's is just an expensive, fancy version of a Panda Express because that is exactly what it is. I don't think of it as anything close to gourmet or fancy, just Americanized Chinese food on Ikea plates. The chicken lettuce wraps were just average. The crispy honey chicken tasted basically like orange chicken...but worse. Yes, it was worse than the orange chicken at Panda Express. The beef and broccoli was also disappointing. I thought this place would have Chinese food with a fancy twist. It was definitely not fancy and the twist was that it sucked. If you want decent (but not the best) Chinese food in San Diego, just go to Convoy. No need to pay an exorbitant amount of money for a fine dining experience to only eat average to lower than average Chinese food. It'll probably only cost you half as much at Emerald or Jasmine (despite their already overpriced menu).  I just don't see what people love so much about this type of food. There as a huge, huge line outside too. On top of this place being a Chinese themed restaurant, they go on to serve dessert in little shot glasses. What a gimmick...and not a very good one at that. $2 for your favorite type of dessert in the form of liquefied pudding. Everything was either too sweet or too tart. And what is up with the waiters/waitresses wearing all black and black turtlenecks? They remind me of that black leotard guy who used to walk around UCSD - you guys know who I'm talking about.",92122

Pulling up you have the option to valet or use the parking garage. Each time I've been here the service has been extraordinary. From being seated to finishing the meal, the staff seems to make every attempt to make you feel as though you're the only one there. One of my favorites on the menu is the lettuce wraps. These could be a meal in itself. The interior decor is like any other Changs out there. The layout is nice and they have some more private areas for larger groups. There is also outdoor seating available if you want to experience the outdoor dining scene however it can be a little loud from the traffic from La Jolla Village Drive.

For a happy hour I have to say this is a PRETTY SOLID DEAL. The happy hour goes from 3-6pm and they have deals that range from $3 - $6 (WHOA lookee there!). I really like this tiered option actually better than the flat price happy hour deals because truly somethings are usually ""worth"" more than other things. For example $6 for nice large and decently liquored mai tai should in fact be priced differently than a $3 draft beer. I think this gives everyone flexibility and you can really make a pretty decent meal as the portions are not skimpy either for happy hour. The thing I hate the most is going for a happy hour deal and getting just a couple of pieces of say shrimp or what not to be shared by only 2-3 people. You definitely get good sized portions for happy hour. My friend and I only got 3 dishes and we didn't even finish everything. I would certainly suggest coming here for happy hour for probably a group of 4. Like I prefaced in the beginning. Let's not even pretend that what is served here is even close to true Chinese food, BUT for the sake of having a good time, getting some drinks, hanging out with friends, eating tasty (albeit not authentic) food I would have to say I like PF Chang's. Some days I just don't feel like hauling my arse to downtown or hillcrest or northpark. I'm glad I was introduced to the happy hour here.

But, after living in NYC for many years and being disappointed again and again by supposedly authentic Chinese food, PF Changs is a gift from heaven.  The ambience is great, music is tasteful and not too loud, lighting is nice and dim, and of course the food is excellent.My personal favorites are: kung pao shrimp, Mongolian beef, lemongrass prawns with garlic noodles, and the amazing chicken lettuce wraps.  The only thing that didn't blow me away was the chicken & cashews which was good but unremarkable.  If you like it spicy try the Dali chicken, or the Szechuan shrimps.This is way better than Panda Express, Pick Up Stix, or Pei Wei, their less expensive spin off.

To me it seemed to lack the basic importance of every guest (not being directly welcomed as I entered). Also you can quickly notice that the owner of this location is only interested in hiring men who look exactly the same; more then  1/2 of the staff is the same weight/height/and facial hair. The interior is very nice; with all glass walls, makes the guest feel different (in a good way). Parking is an issue! There is no actual location to park for this facility, you will need to go to the main road and find a road side parking. (if they have a parking area, it was never fully marketed to be found).Service:The waiter was nice, with smiles all around; felt as if she had a bad day and was trying to play it off. We asked for a round of drinks (about 20min before the happy hour was to end), she literally brought the drinks 20mins later; this made me somewhat disappointed as it should not take 20mins to get drinks from the bar. Lack of service in water, make sure you ask for the re-fills or they will never come back to the table to re-fill it while you are eating.Food: To me the food was SALTY; not sure if it's because of the location being in San Diego, but everything had too much salt in it. I was somewhat dehydrated after having my dinner =-(. Other than the salt the food has the same standard of all PF Chang's.",92122

I've visited the Friars Road location, as well as Otay Ranch mall and La Jolla.  Where do I begin?!?  I used to LOVE this place.  However, the food is absolutely awful.  Last night, a friend and I ordered orange chicken, shrimp lo mein noodles, white rice and choc cake.  To begin with, the food was served nearly cold, not even room temperature. The orange chicken was extremely dry and equally tasteless. The lo mein noodles were hard, dry, and appeared as if they had been sitting under a heat lamp for days! The noodles on the right side of the plate were actually crispy!  Lo mein noodles are supposed to be moist. The quality of PF Changs food has gone downhill. Panda Express would've been a much better option. At least the food is hot, tasteful, and not sitting under a heating lamp for hours. The only positive comment I have to say is our waiter Aaron was great, and the cake was pretty good.I will never eat at another PF Changs again.  Unless you desire food that's over priced, tastes worse than a frozen entree and lacks quality, I suggest you eat somewhere else.

The noodles were a decent size portion. The Mongolian Beef was very tiny compared to the portions I've had dining in the Restaurant. Over cooked, tough, hardly worth the 15.95 I spent. The Kung Paola chicken was so dry and tough. Quick Wok for 1/2 the price and way better food will be my new take out Chinese option.

I was very disappointed when I ate at this place.  I ate here for the first time when I moved to La Jolla.  I was really excited because it was a newly built restaurant with a lot of good reviews (at the time).*People always said that I should always say the positive then the negatives, so here it goes.  (+): The interior decor is clean and nicely decorated.  I like the two horse statues in the front.  (-):   1)  The food.  The food is a replica of panda express.         2) It's EXPENSIVE for something that you could just buy at panda           express        3) Not authentic chinese food .. and yet they charge that much?         4)  Portions: it's tiny!! One plate could only feed one person.  It             seriously looks like they took a scope and placed it on the plate.So, I went with 5 friends (girls and boys).  We were seated in a large booth, but it wasn't enough for all 6 of us.  We ordered 4 plates because one of my friends told us the portions were huge.  Each plate cost about 11.95 - 14.95.  Once we got the food and saw it... we immediately laughed and had to order couple more plates.  The food was not worth it's price.  The food price ranges from $8-19.   The average plate cost $12. Please don't waste your money.  It's not worth it.They have a smaller fast food chain called pei wei.. it sucks too.  Go to panda express, sam woo, 99cents market, etc.",92122

I usually get any one of these items:  -CHICKEN LETTUCE WRAPS- their specialty, can never go wrong.-SHRIMP WITH CANDIED WALNUTS- the honeydew melon it comes with is a nice touch.-LEMON SCALLOPS (don't see it on the menu anymore) - totally sad I dont see it on the menu.- DAN DAN NOODLES- love the spicyness of this dish!***THE BEST PART ABOUT PF***- BANANA SPRING ROLLS- sometimes I just come here JUST for this. The banana spring rolls are just soooo delicious. The banana literally MELTS in my mouth. Top that off with the coconut-pineapple ice cream it comes with and call that my happy place. ooo yesss. =)One point of concern and its happened a couple of times is that service can be a little slow; not all the time, but defintely on a work day you notice these things during lunch. When an hour and a half lunch becomes a two or two and a half hour lunch because of service, it makes you think twice about coming by for a lunch.",92122

The lettuce wraps were great like always.  We decided to order a salad, which had old raw tuna in it.  The waitress tried to convince us that it was fresh and eventually offered to exchange it for another salad.  She suggested one with chicken, which actually turned out to be worse than the  1st one.  The chicken seemed overly processed and just gross.  I went to the mission valley location last summer and the food was extremely salty!!My advice for their service: -have a table really ready before you sit someone down-if you're going to exchange something, bring a menu so we can see our options-ask if you may take a non empty plate from the table!!-don't ask if everything is okay if you can't handle to hear the truth.My advice for customers:-go to Pei Wei if you like the food here.  It is faster, fresher, cheaper.  Their lettuce wraps are the same.",92122

I hear a lot of people say this is very Americanized Chinese chain restaurant and yes that's probably true. But i enjoy their dishes and atmosphere.... even thou it might be not so ""authentic"". For that i can go to Convoy st. The restaurant is very specious with large glass windows, there are 2 rooms, one is a main dinning area and the second one is for large groups. The decor is somewhat contemporary and clean. Its a nice place for a date or for a birthday party. Now.. the food. Of course you have to order their signature appetizer - chicken lettuce wraps (there is a vegetarian version of this dish as well). Definitely very delicious, crisp lettuce with minced spiced chicken. Won-ton soup is mild in flavor but yet has chicken and shrimp, can be shared as well. For the main dish i often order Mongolian beef (very juicy) or orange peel chicken (sweet and spicy at the same time). On my latest trip here i discovered two new mouthwatering and flavorful dishes: ground chicken & eggplant AND Shrimp with candied walnuts (comes with melon pieces, very unusual but delicious combination). Also take advantage of their happy hour 3-6 every day, half off selected appetizers and drink specials.",92122
586,"4540 La Jolla Village Dr San Diego, CA 92122",John G.,"Lafayette, CA",12/21/2006,3,"One of my colleagues recommended this place. While the reservation system, crowds of people, service personnel moving at breakneck speed, and overall loudness would not be in one of my good reviews, I have to admit the food was very tasty and delicious. My friend had the reservation.  You show up expecting to get seated.  Ha! Ha! The reservation is to get a little thingy that lights up and vibrates when your table is ready.  According to many of the other ""waiting"" people, it could be anywhere from 15-40 min. later than the time you thought you had the reservation.  Poor customer service here folks. Of course, I think the reservation system is part of their marketing plan, as they hope you hop to the bar, and buy a drink or two.  We actually tried that and were just about to give up, until finally I almost grabbed the bartender and put in my order.  Was very busy on a Thursday night.  So, our little reservation thingy lights up and off we go to get seated.  Took a while for the server to show up.  The place was rocking and really busy, to admit. Asked for sparkling water.  All they have is something called Bass (I think) comes in a unique bottle that doesn't hold much water (about  1/2 glass each).  Gee, you'd think they never have heard of Pellegrino, Perrier or Calistoga. We ended up having to order another bottle once the food came (thank goodness for expense accounts). Ordered the sea bass, orange peel chicken, Kung Pao shrimp and brown rice.  Took over 25 min. for food to arrive as we expected given the crowd.  When it did arrive, it was served hot, thank goodness.  The sea bass was a nice white fish that had been slightly browned in a scrumptious sauce.  Best dish of the night for sure. Chicken was done very nicely with the orange peel flavor emanating from every bite. Shrimp was a little spicy as ordered, however, really had some unique other spice ingredients that provided a great taste. We both were very pleased with all the food dishes. So, three stars overall, with the food bailing this place out. PF Changs is a chain, and found in all major US cities.",92122

I wasn't that upset about the wait, but I didn't like how I felt like I was sitting in patio furniture when I ate at the flashy restaurant. But it was really the food that left me with a bad taste in my mouth (hardy-har-har). We all shared a variety of dishes, but they were all spicy, so much so my family and I were fighting over the water pitcher.

They took forever to bring out the food. It was late (almost 9pm) and we were starving. In a chinese restaurant, you don't wait until all the entrees are ready to bring them out. You bring them out ASAP!!! There are hungry people :( Or I just don't like waiting 25 minutes for my food.2. They went soy-sauce happy. Every dish was WAY too salty.3. I told myself I'd never go to P.F. Chang's EVER! Because americanized chinese food??? No good right? But we were in SD (not many choices), and we were hungry. It was late and near our hotel so yes.4. Of course, small portions (americanized chinese food!!) and expensive.5. Couldn't taste the oolong in the oolong sea bass. :( 6. Dragon eye oolong tea -- was a tea bag. eep!POSITIVES:1. Ambiance was nice.2. Our server was all smiles3. Convenient location -- near our hotel.Management & Corp needs to SERIOUSLY fix this super salty not-even-chinese-food restaurant chain! That is all.

Changs serves Asian style food.  It's not the best chinese/asian food I have had but it is certainly not the worst.  My personal stand-bys are the Chicken Lettuce Wraps (that can be eaten as a meal), the mongolian beef and the chicken with broccoli.  My BF usually gets the Changs Spciy Chicken,  All entrees come with your choice of white or brown rice.  The portions are definitely large enough that they are meant to be shared.  The price for 2 for dinner with an app and 2 entrees and non-alcoholic drinks will run about $45.00.Lunch is a better time to go if you have free time.  They have a lunch menu on I believe Mon-Sat which has  a variety of bowl options such as moogoogaipan that come with your choice of a soup, rice and an spring roll.  I feel this is a little better bang for my more then ever depleted bucks.The desserts are fairly typical however, if you are really really into chocolate like I am they have a Great Wall of chocolate dessert that is pretty much a monstrous slice of super chocolate cake served with Rasberry sauce.  Pretty decent if your really a chocoholic.Parking is a NIGHTMARE, there are maybe 2 parking spots, other then than you are relegated to parking in the hotel garage, valet or the street.  If ur anything like me you do not really expect a parking nightmare in UTC so I usually pay the valet fee.  They also provide take-out if you simply cannot handle the parking sit.Wait on a normal Fri/Sat can be up to an hour or more and I have been on a random week night and had to wait for about 30 min.All in all not bad not great and everyone really knows what to expect.",92122

They have way too many people working here - just standing around talking among themselves.The food is very salty, across the board, everything was salty. Small portions and on the expensive side and to top if off, my sister felt sick after wards. We didn't really eat family style, everyone had their own dishes which is why no one else got sick.

It's definitely wannabe asian food. You can definitely go to a Chinese restaurant and get something bigger and better for a cheaper price. When compared to authentic Asian food, PF Changs is close to fail. (but don't get me wrong, it ain't HORRIBLE). I give this place a four for their service. GREAT! Well putting aside the fact that our server spilled a drink onto one of my friends, they were super nice, friendly and efficient. After spilling the drink, the server apologized A LOT and the manager came over to offer him a dry shirt he could wear. She even gave him her business card so he could call her if he wanted his shirt dry cleaned! Oh yea, he also got a FREE henny on the rocks. Ok aside from the dude with the wet shirt, the servers were constantly on top of their game. I went on a super busy night filled with proms and graduation dinners.

632,"4540 La Jolla Village Dr San Diego, CA 92122",Michael N.,"Manhattan, NY",8/23/2010,4,"Lets get this out of the way: if you're Chinese and particular about how you like traditional chinese food, then don't even try PF Changs. If you're looking for a place to take your Chinese friends/business associates/relatives then this isn't the place for that either.However, if you don't come here with preconceived notions of what their food SHOULD be like then I think you'll enjoy yourself. I came here on a Saturday night with a few friends looking for a reasonably priced meal that was in the La Jolla area. We each did the Prixe-Fixe for 2 that ends up being $20 a person. Since we had 4 people we got...1. Bowl of soup per person2. 2 appetizers (Crab Wontons and Lettuce Wraps)3. 4 entrees (Broccoli Beef, Mongolian Beef, Kung Pao Shrimp, Chang's Spicy Chicken)4. Mini dessert per personExcept for the mini dessert, the full menu price came out to $83 so we saved $3 and got free dessert. On the surface the prixe-fixe seems pretty awesome but you're probably better off just ordering off the menu.First course was the soup, of which I got the Hot and Sour. At first I did notice it was more salty than i was used to, but I did like the bits of chicken and tofu. I tried some of my friend's egg drop soup and it was better seasoned and probably what I should've ordered. When I come back here next time I'll just skip the soup and save $3 because it's honestly nothing special.The appetizers were good and surprisingly full sized. The crab wontons are awesome especially with the dipping sauce. The lettuce wraps were a little underwhelming but you do get about half a head of lettuce. The chicken mixture was just average and could've been better seasoned. For the entrees, there was definitely a variety of opinions at my table. I thought that the Mongolian beef and Beef and Brocoli were the best. The mongolian beef was tender and had a nice crust to it, and I liked munching on the green onion. One of my friends really liked the spicy chicken, and another really liked the Kung Pao Shrimp. The spicy chicken wasn't spicy to me at all and seemed like chicken breast cubes in sweet and sour sauce. The kung pao shrimp had a great texture but the breading was way too salty for my taste; I did like picking at all the peanuts though.The desserts are basically shot glass sized and I doubt they would be able to charge any money for them normally. I got the red velvet which I thought was fine, but nothing of note. You do get fortune cookies as well in case you were worried :)Service was alright, there was definitely a long lag between getting seated and placing our orders, and there was another long delay between the appetizers and the entrees. Dinner ended up taking about 2 hours total so don't come here on a Saturday night if you're in a hurry! The place was totally packed and not aching for business. I think the decor is pretty classy with a central bar area and plenty of glass windows. Sure you can get ""better"" chinese food in other more authentic places but the tradeoff is the questionable sanitary standards and typically ghetto ambiance. PF Changs costs more because the experience is closer to fine dining and it's a place you wouldn't be embarrassed to bring a date. I'm looking forward to coming back here again another time!",92122

My friend who loves tradition goes here to celebrate his birthdays and of course being the great friend I am, I have to come along even though I detest this place. I ordered the Mandarin Chicken and it lacked anything a real tasty dish has. To add to the pisspoor taste, my dish came out 30 minutes after serving it.

After a long drive and with my little girl hungry, I thought why not?! Very modern decor and a snooty hostess. We were waiting for a few more people and when the hostess had to wait, my sister saw her rolled her eyes. Umm excuse me, if it had been me who caught her doing that, I would definitely have said something. Customer service is high on my priority list when it comes to rating a business. So one star off for that. Another star off for this dirty smell, it just didn't feel clean hence why they have dark furniture.Food was just okay, too pricey for something that didn't really taste all that good. We ordered the following: Salmon with asparagus - this dish was a bit too dry and lacked flavorMongolian beef - When they first brought this dish out, it looked really plain but it was surprisingly good. Does not taste like your traditional MB dish, more on the sweeter side.Almond & Cashew Chicken - This dish tasted better than it looked. Beef and brocolli - Crunchy brocolli and tender beef, your typical B&B. Spinach with garlic - Something that you can easily cook up yourself. I love spinach but if you do not cook it a certain way, it leaves a weird taste in your mouth and that's what happened when we ate this dish.I did however loved how they have brown rice("",)Would I ever go back? Probably not. It's too modernized for me and no, I'm not even Chinese. I think I've had too many great Chinese food to waste my money and appetite for PFC.

BUT it turns out he put in the 2nd drink order at happy hour price and mixed it up for me as soon as I finished the first one (past the time limit), so yay!The food was good, we ordered the crispy green beans, which were batter fried (remoulade dipping sauce was good but a little spicy for the Boy), three kinds of steamed dumplings (they come in servings of 3), and pork and shrimp street tacos (I liked the pork better). The food was about $5-6 a plate. For drinks we got mai tais and the 88 Martini. All in all it was a pretty good happy hour dinner, and service was attentive considering it was the bar at happy hour, someone checked on us every 5-10 minutes.Bonus, we got to watch the Monday Night game on their TVs!Parking tip, the restaurant has parking at the Embassy Suites parking structure which requires validation, but we were at UTC mall anyway across the street so we just parked at the far end of the Sears lot and crossed LJ Village Drive to get to the restaurant.",92122

Bummer:( not filling at all but after that I didn't even want to try anything else. Drinks: I had the Mai tai. That and the service is the only reason I'm giving 3 stars. Tangy and sweet at the same time. I like drinks when you can actually tell that there is alcohol in it. Sometimes for happy hour I feel like places skimp on the actual alcohol and you just end up drinking juice.  This once you could subtly taste the rum.  Definitely a winner!Service:  Our waitress was great.  She was attentive, came to check on us often, and when the bill came and we presented her with 2 coupons (technically it says one per table) she tried to make it work so we could get an extra discount.  Even though the register wouldn't accept the 2nd one, we were glad she tried instead of just saying no.  I might come back here for another drink or maybe to try something else on the menu, but with all the other great happy hours in the area it wouldn't be my first choice.",92122

She says she's sorry and that yes, she had run my credit card for the $220 in error and that I had been credited back. I went and explaining to her no my bank only is showing as charged and no credit was made or showing that was being put back to my account. She went on explaining to me how the credit back works but nothing she was telling me was making any sense. She also apologized for not having someone from the restaurant inform me of the error made. Everyone kept telling me,she pocketed the cash or tried thinking you wouldn't notice the charge made on ur credit card. And no I wouldn't of notice the charge if it wasn't for my husband. She then went on explaining to give it a few days for the credit to be put back on my card and she wanted to mail me a $50 dollar GC for the inconvenience.

F.  Chang's!  As my husband is Asian and I have eaten a lot of good Asian food, we don't usually go to this restaurant.  We like the food on Convoy much better!  However, we decided to give it one more try!  I wish I had not and given the card to someone else.When we came in, it was not busy and we were seated right away!  We chose a both over the chair and booth seat that was offered - more comfy.  The server came over and took our drink request and returned with the drinks while we reviewed the menu.  I decided upon the lemon grass chicken salad and a cup of egg drop soup.  My husband had the Korean chicken with brown rice.  My soup arrived first, but there was no set up or napkins yet!  I was hungry so I didn't wait and started the soup.  It is more like a good chicken soup with a bit of Asian touches - peas, slivered carrots, and the eggs whites cooked in the soup broth.  It is not the traditional yellow, thick soup! It was yummy though!  My husband's food arrived next and looked wonderful!  It was spicy enough for him and the rice was fine.  I tasted a piece of the chicken, but it wasn't to my liking.  Still, I am glad that he liked what he ordered.  Finally my salad arrived.  It was NOT what I ordered and the server seemed bewildered that I didn't want it.  It was the Waldorf salad with kale.  No thanks, I wanted the lemon grass chicken salad!  That is what I had orderedI questioned the server and she pressed me to accept the salad.  I told her that I had been looking forward to the lemon grass chicken salad with mango and avocado and clearly this was not it.  Another server chimed in with ""take it back and throw some avocado on it""!  By then, my husband and I were frustrated so he asked for the menu.  We showed the servers the salad descriptions which clearly stated that the salad delivered to our table was NOT the one I ordered.  Finally, the wrong salad was removed and a new salad was brought to the table; it took some time though!  I was so happy at first, but then I tried to find the mango and avocado.  The mango was cut into small squares and the avocado was difficult to find as well.  The dressing was refreshing and the greens crunchy, but egad!  What a disappointment!We decided to order dessert and chose the New York cheese cake.  Our server brought fresh plates and two new forks. That was good as one of the forks and one of the plates were not as clean as they should be; that sometimes happens at home even.   The cheese cake arrived - a large piece with blueberries, strawberries and raspberry puree (there could have been more)!  A sprig of mint might have been nice, too.  I was also given another glass of ice tea even though I hadn't wanted one.  That tells me the server is either not listening or trying to overcompensate!Would we return?  Not likely!  I would suggest more training for the servers to help them understand how to work with customers and understand that when a mistake is made, they need to admit to it and correct it.  At least offer a complimentary something as a gesture of goodwill.  I write this review in the hopes that the management reads it and improves upon other customers' experiences.  Thank you!",92122

Parking was ridiculous, unless you stay at the hotel they're affiliated with or you want to pay for valet parking, it can be a little tricky.  I ended up parking on the street and walking in. I was by myself and I got seated near the bar which was nice. The staff was very friendly, and accommodating. I ordered the eggplant with ground chicken which wasn't on the menu anymore but they gladly made it for me. I also got the Lettuce wraps and a glass of white wine. Perfect dinner. I took most of the eggplant home and the waiter gave me extra brown rice to go too, it was awesome. Overall good place with great service, however parking is weird, so 1 star off.",92122

My wife and I went on a Sunday afternoon expecting it not to be busy, which is wasn't, and the service to be good as a result, which it was not. We asked to sit outside and was given our choice of table. Upon sitting down, I noted the table next to me had not been cleaned. A party of approximately four was just leaving as we arrived and it took nearly 30 minutes for them to clean that table. We also had a tray with dirty dishes standing right next to us. Both the table and tray made me feel as if I was eating in an unclean environment. I couldn't understand why the area around us couldn't be quickly cleaned considering we we were only one of two parties eating outdoors at the time. Towards the end of my meal I couldn't take it anymore and eventually asked my server if she could remove the tray (another server had already broken down the table). Aside from that, the service and food was average at best. I've eaten at this location countless times before but as of today I don't think I will ever go back.",92122

I've been going to this restaurant since it's opened. Sure things have changed - portion size for example but their menu has expended. When they opened they didn't have even egg drop soup, not even their famous lettuce wraps. Prices have too changed - 5 years ago you would pay $15 for Oolong sea bass now it's over $25. But never the less it's pretty nice food. Of course for many Chinese people this food many be strange but you have to remember that it's Americanised Chinese food.

Usually it takes 30mins every time we go and there is a bar and comfy seating for easy chatting while you wait.  A pager lights up when your table is ready alerting you to get your ass up and find the hostess.

I've never been so disappointed in a restuarant's service and the hostess' attitude like I received at the P. F. Chang's on  La Jolla Village Dr. My lunch companiion and I arrived at 12 noon were seated immediately and told a waiter would be coming soon. At 12:20pm still no service at which point my companion on the way to the restroom informed the hostess of the problem she assured him that a waiter would be at the table immediately. When my friend came back to the table still no service at 12:40pm we left. On the way out the hostess saw us coming towards her and she turned her back to us (I'm guessing she didn't want a confrontation) We let her know we were leaving because of the terrible service. Her response was oh ok sorry. The valet parking attendant was more embarressed by the shoddy service than anyone in the restuarant. He appologized repeatedly asking us to please not give up on PF Chang's and to please come back. My friend and I have been going there for years but not sure if we will return now.,92122

666,"4540 La Jolla Village Dr San Diego, CA 92122",Jack K.,"San Jose, CA",5/17/2008,2,"P F Chang's is definitely not your authentic Chinese restaurant. It is full of people with money willing to empty their pockets for Americanized Chinese food when you can get it way cheaper at some other joint like Panda Express or Pick Up Stix. You can go to anywhere else in San Diego, like all along Convoy, to get real Chinese food! This place was disappointing because I expected so much for such steep prices.The service was good though, probably better than any other Chinese restaurant. Nothing really seemed authentic about anything. A plus was that the hostess looked like Lucy Liu.I think upon walking in, I saw all these business people dressed up in their fancy clothes and suites. They stared back as they didn't think someone in college could pay for this food that seemed so ""high class"". However, I realized that the food was a joke and that these people were being ridiculous for thinking they were eating anything close to what Chinese food should taste like.Another good thing is that you can sit outdoors and enjoy the great La Jolla weather. The restaurant is also on a big street corner, so at least there's a lot of outdoor seating. I'm sure that it'd be nice to eat there there on a warm summer night.I did find the mixture of sauces by the waitress very interesting.

Out of the three, the Mai Tai was the only drink that wasn't watered down and had any alcoholic content. The food was extremely mediocre, and still overpriced during happy hour. The service was slow, and it didn't appear that busy when we were there around 4pm.My experience today at P.F.

I mean we have all eaten here and to be honest the reason why we come back is because we are trying to nip whichever particular craving that we happen to be experiencing. There are so many PF Chang's across the U.S. that we know that no matter which place we happen to 'pop' into that we already know what to expect. With that said let me remind you that this review is only based on this particular location. I stop by this place usually on a whim. I'll be heading home trying to figure out what to cook for dinner and when I pass by I figure, ""why the heck not?"" Lunch time is always a fun time to come in not only is the mall across the street but there are business buildings all around and it does get busy. Either way make a reservation or plan on a wait. Even the bar seats fill up during lunch and dinner. The bar has a pretty good selection of wines and specialty drinks. If you're looking for an after dinner coffee then I would suggest trying something different and going with one of the hot teas selections. Vegetarian lettuce wraps are what I am usually craving. For dinner my favorite dish is dan dan noodles. I get it with tofu instead of chicken but always check with your server first because not all of the cooks are willing to do this. It's also spicy so be warned. I ask for a milder version. Another good vegetarian dish is vegetable chow fun. It's also spicy with wide egg noodles. The service is always excellent. If there is something wrong with your order the servers are great about rectifying it. Drinks are kept full and food is served hot. Service is all around great!",92122

Their Americanized version isn't inedible, but for the prices one would think it would be a culinary treat, and frankly, the quality is barely average. There is validated parking, but watching some of the ""oops"" of the valets, I was glad I parked across the street at UTC.The Mongolian beef was WAY too salty (imagine drinking a shot of soy sauce), and the wonton soup was bland (Wonton Top Ramen has more flavor). I did like the brown rice and the crispy honey shrimp. The chocolate dome was... interesting. I don't know if I'd get it again though. What did irritate me a little was how long it took for my bottled beer to get to the table - our server apologized and apparently this is an ongoing problem with their bar staff.As for the service, our server seemed like a nice guy, but was having a really off night, or... The table was wet and dirty so I asked him for napkins to clean it off. Every time I asked for paper napkins he came back with more place settings. When the soup came he spilled it all over me - thankfully, the soup was luke-warm so it was more like getting drenched in cooled-off pee - I'd take that over getting burned. And when he was boxing our leftovers he spilled our food, and there were bits of food and sauce all over the outside of the bag, like we picked it out of the trash. He tried to make a couple jokes throughout the evening, with some being belly busters and some falling awkwardly flat.In a nutshell: Meh. I've experienced better. If you're looking for good, authentic Chinese food, go somewhere else. If you're more into the ambiance and image, this is the place to go since it has a nice atmosphere and their servers are attractive, though that isn't an indication of how good a server they are.",92122

I can't think of anything that's OMGWTFBBQPWN I have to have it, but the same holds true for the reverse. Sig-o's never been to one and knows tons of people who rave about it, so we rolled down to the UTC one last night and had the Kung Pao chicken, Lemon Scallops and egg rolls for an appetizer. Everything came out warm and tasteful, service was good, and the interior decor is pleasantly ""asian"" without feeling like you're in a caricature.So overall 3/5...beware though, parking is a b*itch in that area.

We were sat at a large table when we had no other people with us, as we were waiting  group of family came to our table and just sat themselves, I had my jacket and purse sitting next to me because I didn't want it falling off the chair or on the table, one of the women asked if we were waiting for other people we said no. Honestly we were trying to have a private dinner on a holiday and these people bombarded our table and ask if I owned the restaurant and told me to move my stuff, told her family I had issues, was all around a rude person, my boyfriend said there's no reason to act like a bitch and then they tried to fight us. After the scene was made we started to leave, they offered to get us other table but what's the point we had been waiting and these people just ruined our dinner which we never got.

While waiting for our friends to decide on food, waiter complained to another waiter about a table that had just left with maybe 10-12 people there, the tip they had left behind was too little. After we ate, the waiter came out with seperate bills for our party which we all had ordered dinners for two, some how he was not interested in serving us, he didn't not bring desert menus over first which should have been done until we asked? After we got desert.  I paid my bill and not feeling I had been served 20% tip I had left it anyways, as soon as we left the patio, he stopped everything he was doing to run over and look at the reciepts, shaking his head.

It's for two people (perfect for date night) you get 2 soups (highly recommend the wonton soup) then you get a choice of one appetizer the chicken lettuce wraps are out of this world and probably most popular, at this point I'm very full but you get two entrées (we shared the two so we ordered something we both liked) we got the changs spicy chicken.. It's a must and always consistently amazing! And we got the kung po spicy chicken not too spicy but wasn't my favorite. I also really like the chicken lo-mein it's a noodle would of ordered that if I could go back. Then to top it off we both got a dessert wonton that was filled with warm sweet vanilla cream!

I ordered hot and sour soup and Mongolian beef. Both were almost ineffable they were so salty. I sat at the bar since I was alone on a business trip. I had asked the bartender for suggestions but was told he does not eat here. The bartenders were very occupied with being very friendly with an attractive host or floor manager that they neglected to ask if I wanted refills on alcohol or even a glass of water. I always had to flag them down. Unfortunately I will not be returning and I am in town several days a month. I have them a two because they are a national restaurant they have to be doing something right. At this location more attention to service is needed and less salt.,92122

Today the meal was absolutely unacceptable. So my parents usually share 2 starters and i get the sesame chicken. Today it was salt and pepper calamari, pork dumplings, and sesame chicken with white rice. The calamari came out very late even though it wasn't at all busy, it was so dry and reminded me of beef jerky, seriously it was a challenge to bite through it. We sent it back and we hadn't received our dumplings because the chef burnt the first batch. So the calamari had the same problem the second time and had to send it back again and almost cancelled it all together, but the waiter wanted to get us a new one. The dumplings were just ok. Then the third calamari came and it was a little less tough, but edible. The sesame chicken wasn't that good and the rice was kinda bad either. btw the water refills were kinda slow.Then the bill came and nothing was comped i know it's wrong to expect to be comped something, but come on the apps coming after like 40 minutes and it wasn't busy and the visit took us over an hour. This restaurant has steadily been going downhill since the old manager left and i think after this experience we wont be coming here anymore.On top of all that, the parking situation is horrible.",92122

Chang's.  They gush and gush about how amazing of a restaurant it is and how I should count my sweet blessings that I live in the glowing aura of Mr. Chang.  I don't get it.  What am I missing?The last time I was here we shared a plate of the lettuce wraps.  This was a safe option.  If nothing else, P.F. Chang's helped make lettuce wraps famous, right?  Were they good?  Mildly.  The chicken was a little bland and the lettuce was starting to brown around the edges.  My out-of-town guests practically wet themselves with delight when they had a taste of the lettuce wraps.  Again I ask: what the heck am I missing here?!  Did my tastebuds enter some parallel universe when we entered P.F. Chang's?!  I don't get it!Next up: we shared a plate of lemon chicken.  I wasn't impressed.  The sauce was so sour and cloyingly lemony, that I could barely taste any chicken through it.  And the dish was slimy and it had the color of pee.  But as expected, my companions heaped tons of culinary praise on the lemon chicken, but I couldn't figure out why.  As this point, I figured we would simply never agree on anything we would end up ordering there.(Full disclosure: My dining buddies and I normally agree on things.  I swear that this only happened at P.F. Chang's.)But, to be completely fair, I should give it 1 star for a keeping everything tidy and a 2nd star for that neato horse monolith thing that faces the street out in front.  Or something.Since I live close by, I walk over.  There's never enough parking here, so I recommend parking at UTC across the street.",92122

We got there early so it wasn't crowded yet. All was well. Had the tasty vegetarian lettuce wraps and edamame steamed dumplings. I ordered Buddha's Feast and my sister got a curry dish from the (tiny) vegetarian section of the menu. When they arrived I asked the waitress if the curry dish was vegan (it looked good and I wanted to try it). She informed me that NONE of the dishes at P.F. Chang's were vegan, because they ALL contained oyster sauce! I was like, whoa, hold on there Josie, these dishes were in the vegetarian section of your menu, and didja know? Vegetarians don't eat oysters!  She was a bit blown away by that revelation. I insisted that she scurry off to the kitchen to ask the chef if they were indeed making their vegetarian dishes with real oyster sauce.Well, of course they weren't, as she brightly chirped when she returned to our table. The ""oyster"" sauce is a vegetable sauce make to taste like oyster sauce.  (I believe them, don't you?  You do, don't you?)So we ate it all, and it was good.It just surprises me the number of waitresses and/or waiters who don't know what vegetarian food is (even when it's on their restaurant's menu), let alone know what vegan food is, and really don't know what the ingredients are in the food they are serving.  I guess it's too much to ask.Other than that the food was good and the service was good, and I will go back again sometime.But LMK if you hear anything about that ""oyster"" sauce that you think I should know...",92122

The bartender Richie made a face when I ordered my drink and said he makes the chocolate martini with espresso 'not the corporate way' that made me feel uncomfortable so I said ok not wanting to be a pain. The drink way eh average but not what I'm used to. I ended up ordering a second one and it TASTED LIKE SOAP AND SMELLED LIKE SOAP!!! He saw my reaction and apologized (at least). No manager ever apologized. He served me another one and it was fine. When he gave us the bill he charged me for both martinis. I asked why he was charging me for the second one when I had a horrible experience and he got upset and said I'll see what I can do and walked away. When he came back he just slammed the receipt down and walked away. The drink was taken off but gosh what horrible customer service!!! Also they got rid of their tiny deserts (another favorite).

Looking around the place, I noticed that the glass doors were filthy with greasy fingerprints everywhere. The floors were even dirtier. Has anyone thought of running a broom around this place? Service was bad. Had to ask several times for water and glasses never refilled. We waited forever for our main dish to arrive. Heard the people next to us complain about the wait too and the waiter said ""it just got really busy.."".  Yeah, but it wasn't busy when we placed our orders 45 minutes ago!!The food finally arrived and the Kung Pao shrimp was not edible - it should be a crime to serve food so salty! Basically, it was a plate of deep fried battered shrimp with a salty sauce and a pile of greasy peanuts on top.  Good thing we ordered our ""mini desert"" that was included in the fixed price menu to go.  The desert ended up being a tiny desert stuffed in a plastic tube - they said it was five bites worth, but wasn't even that.

In fact, it was started by a non-club-member (ie. white man), Patrick Finnegan.  And to give his upstart restaurant some street juice, he added the suffix Chang to his initials PF.(in the same vein that three Jewish brooklyn'ite rappers go by the aliases Mike D, Adrock, and MCA as opposed to Diamond, Horovitz, and Yauch)If my ancient Chinese history serves me correctly, the Chang name dates back to the legendary King Huang Di, who held throne 20 miles south of Ping in the Shandong Province.

""Haagght haghttt!"" as he contracts desperately to move his bowels.....Fun stuff that Randy man.I think this might have been my 3rd time eating at this exact PF Changs this year.  I like this place... I really do, but why 3-stars? I think it well may be the food? I'm not sure. I'd rate this a 3.5, but Yelp won't allow me to do so. I'm not exactly a fan of this place if I've only came 3 times this year. Right? Sure.There is one dish that I ALWAYS get when coming here. There's literally not ONE time when I didn't get it: Kung Pao Scallops.  It's SO damn delicious, word's can't explain how yummy it is.  The scallops are seared perfectly, leaving a crisp crust that will help absorb a lot of the kung pao flavors, however, not making it soggy.  I've tried their Mongolian Beef, which is quite a generic entree choice.  You really cannot go wrong with this dish unless you are allergic to beef or green onions. By the way, whenever ordering a dish, it's not something that you could eat by yourself unless you like the thought of gaining 4 extra pounds.  These are sharing portions as indicated with the large spoon served alongside with it.  Come with a party, or be prepared to ask for a doggy bag.  What else have I tried... the Lettuce Wraps appetizer is also a no fail item.  I absolutely love putting the spicy mixture the servers make on the wraps. Spicy, sweet, and SUPER savory.  I've also tried the Double Pan Fried Noodles (w/beef).  This one was okay. I feel that I've had better at more authentic Chinese diners.  The egg noodles were really thick and were less than 'double' pan fried. I understand that the sauce might have ""softened"" the noodles up, but the word 'double pan fried' is a bit misleading.  I mean, I've made pan fried noodles (thin egg noodles), and that thing stayed consistently crispy throughout the meal. I've tried the some kind of Honey Chicken dish, which was pretty good. It resembled Orange Chicken, without the oranges?  It was good, but the Wow factor wasn't there.  All the time's I've ever dined in, the service has always been phenomenal! They make your special sauce at the beginning right in front of you are very attentive.  I believe my last server was Keith? He was GREAT! Refilled our drinks just about when we needed another, always checked up on us, brought out a complimentary dessert for my sister (the birthday girl).  They package up your remaining food togo in front of you. Nice. ' Hey mister... i'm watching you....' The environment is nice and well maintained for the most part.  There were a few tables around where we sat that were kind of screaming for help to be saved for a mass of dirty dishes piled on it, but it didn't stay that way for too long.  I like how there are huge glass windows to let all the light shine in to give more natural lighting within the building.Never been here for happy hour, but I know they've got a $3-6 deal during 3-6pm M-F (don't quote me on that though).  I'm sure to try it one day, and probably back at this location since service is so wonderful.The only thing that boggles my mind is how Americanized this establishment.

Getting There:Trouble began before I even entered the restaurant.  After scouring for an open parking space amid the sea of La Jolla's finest mid-life crisis mobiles, I opted to wait near the curb for one of the (two) designated pickup parking slots to become available.  Despite the fact that I was not obstructing vehicle in the parking area, the valet attendants asked me to move my car.  When I informed them that I was there to pick-up food, they advised me to park in the red fire lane.  Now aside from my being a lawyer and thus having an occupational aversion to breaking the law, and aside from inherent desire not obstruct the fire department's ability to save a kitten from a tree, somehow I had the feeling that the valet attendant would be less-than-willing to fork over half his monthly salary to me in the event that I got a parking ticket.   Eventually, after brief negotiations with a senior valet attendant (valet captain? lieutenant? general?), I was ""allowed"" to park there and pickup my food. . . .The Food:My repartee with the parking sentinels was only slightly less appetizing than the food I picked up.  Not entirely terrible, not entirely satisfying, it was greasy and salty, not unlike a high school math teacher.  The cooks were kind enough to throw a few slivers of chicken and vegetables into my Chicken and Vegetable Low Mein meal, but only to such an extent that the meal was not a complete and total misnomer.  The Service:To his credit, the guy at the register was courteous and quick; however, at that point my experience was already beyond salvation.  Considering the cost and quality of food, I doubt I'll be returning to B.S.

I got no garlic, lots of sauce and a very mediocre dish. Also, had a grandchild who needed to use the restroom and I was appalled at how filthy it was. No toilet paper, a mess all over the floor, unflushed toilets, etc. I would recommend going anywhere but here. Apparently customer service is not something they care about at all.",92122

It depends on the bartenders or server that day if you get good service or good drinks! I've been here 4 times and each time I get the same thing (Moscow mule, chicken lettuce wrap, crab wontons and then I switch on and off with garlic noodles or orange chicken)...pretty easy stuff I say....! Well it's never consistent and I've had a great experience over all with both food and drinks only 1 time out of the 4...all other times something goes terribly wrong! Don't depend on this place for consistency!!! The only good and consistent thing about this place is the set up and how spacious it is. Other than that the parking situation is a bit silly (either valet for $3 or self park and get validation). What happened to just parking and not having to worry about those things. PF changs...

Since it is a chain restaurant i didn't have the highest of expectations. I ordered the servers recommendation since I didn't know what was good, and I don't eat meat (just seafood). He recommended I try the Kung pao Scallops, so I did. They were chewy and very small, I was not happy with my choice one bit. Now onto the service, It was intrusive and awkward, I wont go into why he was acting this way, but the server was intrusive nevertheless.

The gluten-free selection is somewhat limited, but they have an appetizer, a few main courses including some rice noodle dishes, and a great dessert.I've always loved the Chang's Chicken Lettuce wraps, and the GF version tastes just the same.  The Singapore street noodles and shrimp with lobster sauce are also both very good.  I can't recommend the Chang's lemon scallops as I found the gluten-free version to be overpoweringly lemony.  The flourless chocolate dome is to die for if you're a fellow chocoholic.I've added this to the gluten-free restaurant list so hopefully fellow celiacs will be able to find it.",92122

We were given a coupon for a free appetizer to offset this horrific delay. The restaurant was noisy and full of children running around.

This restaurant is nearly a carbon copy of most other P F Chang's around the world with a nice clean and comfortable decor. However like many others it suffers from being excessively noisy when there is more than 50% occupancy. The overall service was very good with constant attention (e.g. fill drinks, taking orders, etc.), orders were correct, etc.On the culinary side, the menu is essentially the same everywhere with a good selection of appetizers, entrees and deserts complimented by a full bar and reasonable selection of beer and wine. I was fortunate to try 5 different appetizers and 6 different entrees with the overall grade for appetizers being a B+ and entrees being a C. The fried Chinese beans, shrimp dumplings and firecracker shrimp were wonderful and accompanied by sauces that had a lot of flavor and complimented the appetizer. The chicken wraps lacked flavor and the portion seemed small. The entrees I tried included honey prawns, kung pao chicken, Chinese string beans, orange chicken and chow fun. The honey prawns were simply decadent with great flavor and generous portion. The chow fun had a nice hint of tamarind but was a bit dry. The beans were good too. The orange chicken and kung pao lacked flavor and the chicken was dry.

People have a whole lot of disdain for this place. Who would have ever thought since the place is always packed like a can of sardines with hordes of people. After reading the other reviews here are my thoughts on their complaints:  #1 The parking. There is no denying that it is horrible at this location. You must valet or go with someone that has a disabled placard since they do have ample disabled parking in their lot. #2 The wait. I would never dream of coming here without a reservation set up well in advance. Otherwise you can expect an a la Cheesecake Factory wait. #3 The front desk staff. Yes they are overwhelmed and not always the most gracious and courteous. I find that if you just match their demeanor and make it very clear what you want they will oblige. If that does not work complain to the Maitre'D or call the corporate number for resolution if that does not work. #4 The noise level. It is simply atrocious. What a ruckus this place is and good luck keeping a conversation with a large party of people. #5 The service. The service here is good but not great. Sometimes it borders on mediocrity like my past visit. The wait staff consists of mostly collage age students trying to get by while staying beautiful. Yes they do forgot to refill your iced tea sometimes and try to turnover the table far too quickly.#6 The food. P F Chang's is Americanized Chinese food and does not claim to be an authentic Chinese experience. That does not mean the food is not great. This is fusion. We are lucky in San Diego that you can have an authentic Chinese experience at places such as Jasmine and Emerald just to name a couple.,92122

As soon as we came in, I got the idea that it was a totally upscale restaurant since there were a lot of obviously rich looking people. I liked the interior design. The servers were extremely friendly and I couldn't have asked for better ones. The only thing I didn't like about my experience there was that the food was quite overpriced. I can honestly name a handful of restaurants nearby that serves genuine tasting Asian food for a much lower price. The food was satisfying but I know it could've been so much better, it just wasn't on point compared to what I'm used to and I've had quite plenty. I just felt like we were paying for the environment, friendly service and the maintenance of the restaurant, seeing how upscale it is. Would I come back to this restaurant? Maybe. There are many other places where we could save so much more money with better quality and genuine taste. Let's just say the ""Asian"" food here had a westernized twist.",92122

All of the girls hate the food but somehow, we find ourselves here at least once a year (it's got to be the adrenaline rush we get from trying to climb the big horse statues without people seeing us haha). The ambiance is definitely nice and the wait staff is great. However, it's hard for me to overlook how expensive the food is when it is so boring! The dishes here lack pizazz and the flavors all fall very flat. The menu is very one-note to me. For example, the crispy honey chicken I had was a medium, at best, sized serving of fried pieces of battered chicken drizzled with a sweet honey sauce served over more fried rice sticks. What in the world?!? There was nothing exciting on the plate and I'm all for simplicity, but it has to be done right! When I'm craving Chinese, P.F. Chang's never comes to mind. This place serves a very westernized take on Chinese food, but clearly this is just one person's opinion because people love it. The place is usually booming with business.",92122

I have been here probably 10 times in the past 18 months, and more often than not there is a problem. A problem with either the wait to get a table (even with reservation) or the wait to get your food once you've ordered. I have been to PF Chang's all over SoCal and Vegas so I know the drill. This place has a nice ambiance and the music isn't overpowering neither is the lighting.  They make the ambiance nice because they know you will be there A VERY LONG TIME!But this Changs is the sloppiest I have been too. Last time I ordered the prawns with garlic noodles and the noodles had set around so long they had hardened on top.  ALso, your appetizers may arrive after your meal.  WTF?  Don't plan on getting drunk here no matter how much $$ you bring. For some reason people who order drinks who aren't at the bar get lowest priority. It can take literally 20+ minutes to get your drink even when the place isn't packed.  OK then? FUck you, I'll spend my $$ elsewhere.The final reason to avoid this place is the parking situation. More often than not the validation doesn't take. I was almost charged $8 even with validation, but thankfully an employee of the garage or the hotel next door opened the gate.  I don't want to risk an expensive dinner, then have a fucking hassle like paying extortionary pricing to park my car.  I enjoy me some PF Chang's. This is just a rant about this specific Chang's.  Actually I would rather drive the extra distance to the one in Chula Vista, or even go to the hell known as mission valley to fight traffic at Fashion Valley mall, which has the worst traffic flow of any mall on earth.",92122

Chang - mostly since I've moved out of the area for a while.  I remember food was good before so I was eager to go back again.  The dim sum lunch special should really be called lunch appetizer set since it's enough food for perhaps people on extremely limited calorie diet but not for average appetite.  My coworker and I both ordered it and agreed it's not enough food for lunch.  Considering we are both small women with average appetite, if we're not full, I can't image anything feeling full with that quantity.  Luckily, I ordered vegetarian delight dish as well so we were full but needed 3 lunch sets.  In the end, I was definitely disappointed with the food.  The sweet and sour soup should be renamed soy sauce soup since it was almost as salty as eating hot soy sauce.  I returned the soup for the salad which was edible but not particularly noteworthy.  The vegetarian delight was anything but delightful.  It was basically steamed unseasoned vegetables next to steamed unseasoned rice.  You can make this dish at home by steaming vegetables and placing it next to steamed rice.  For a $15 lunch without a specialty drink, it was remarkably unremarkable.  If you want to impress someone with expensive lunch at a nice location, this maybe the place but if you lunch out regularly and want delicious satisfying lunch, look elsewhere.",92122

I wipe the sweat off my forehead, realizing that she knows how to save the day when PF Chang's starts spinning its wheels. Red vinegar and soy sauce.

Normal, right? The waitress then brought out the appetizer she had suggested. She apologized and knew she got our order wrong. We didn't want to be jerks, so we reluctantly said it was okay and took the thing we didn't want. It wasn't good at all. Our main entrees were also very mediocre. Not any better than panda express honestly, and it was ~3x the price. Then when she brought us the bill, we realized that she had charged us full price for the appetizer that she screwed up--even though it was MORE EXPENSIVE than the thing we originally ordered and didn't even get to try!! I think the ""norm"" would be to charge maybe half price for something when the server screws up and the patrons are nice about it (or at least charge us for the cheaper appetizer that we actually wanted), but apparently not here.Needless to say, I'm never going back there.

It's really difficult to have a conversation when it is so crowded.  I guess it's not really a 'warm, cozy ' atmosphere.. that would be a great improvement, and I'd probably go more often if they could reduce the noise level considering that it is usually crowded!!",92122

The guy who brought the food out did not, and the waiter had to keep apologizing and fixing. But he was clearly giving his attention to the larger groups, which would be larger tickets and tips. Our soup arrived too hot to eat, but was delicious once it cooled down. I asked for crunchy noodles with my egg drop soup, which were forgotten. The entrees were brought without plates, so we had to reuse our appetizer plates. I ordered the sweet and sour chicken, which arrived without rice. And tasted like overly sweet lemon chicken. My husband had chicken lo mein, which was about on par with Panda Express. For dessert we had the Peanut Butter Chocolate Crunch. The taste was delicious. The consistency was dense. Very dense. We couldn't get a fork through it, and ended up taking turns holding the plate and dessert in place for each other. The atmosphere was loud - 'Vegas loud.  More family buffet than fine dining.

Like if you know you messed up, just own it and apologize. No biggie! When he came back asking if we wanted a box to take it home and we were quick to say no, one would think that would be an insight into the meal not being to our liking.

The hostesses said it would be 30 minutes for a table or I could grab any open seats at the bar. We sit down at the lower ADA accessible bar seats which were available and before we could order, a very rude hostess, maybe only 20 years comes over to me and my girlfriend and rudely tells us we need to leave and that it only for handicapped people. First of all, the ADA laws say these seats are supposed to be available for those in wheelchairs, but not for exclusive use. A handicapped person who walks in the door to a busy restaurant does not immediately get sat down bypassing everyone already in line. Much like the handicapped stall in the bathroom, is that meant to be left open and waiting for a disabled person? I think not. It's not like there's a handicapped plaque or card for use in a restaurant. Also HIPPA laws say that I do not have to share my medical history just to get some take out Chinese food.I told her that I was a veteran and if since it's open, could we sit there and just order food to-go. She said no and kicked us out of the seats and told us to order from the take out side. I guess my PTSD and hardware in my shoulder and knee isn't enough for that little brat who has no respect for customers and apparently the military. This place needs to talk to their people and they 1) need to properly understand the ADA laws 2) be respectful of those who serve our country. This happened July 24, 7:00 pm. I'm never going here again. It's upsetting because the food was good in past. If you are military or ex military, avoid this place.",92108

Beef & broccoli definitely nothing special about this. We didn't end up finishing it. It wasn't as good as we predicted it to be. We personally agreed that Panda Express has better beef & broccoli. Appetizer sampler was good. The crab filled appetizer was lacking on crab meat. The spring rolls were great!Chicken wraps are always good here. Personally the only thing on the menu worth the price.

897,"7077 Friars Rd San Diego, CA 92108",Laurae S.,"Grantville, San Diego, CA",7/12/2021,2,"I am disappointed in my dining experience tonight for many reasons. First, our waitress seemed to care less about my table from the beginning. There were only two of us at the table, yet Delaney made us feel as troublesome as a table of 15. Throughout our two hour dining experience, not by choice, she spoke to us less and less until she simply avoided our table unless absolutely necessary. Second, it took 40 minutes from the time we sat down for our appetizers, edamame and fried green beans, to be served. I understand that there are sometimes hold ups in the kitchen that are outside of a servers control, however nothing was communicated to us until only one appetizer was brought out at the 40 minute mark. It was at this point that Delaney finally reappeared, now that she was done servicing and checking in on every other table around us, to take our entree order. Third, we ordered our entrees when our appetizers arrived and it took 32 minutes for the first to show up and 34 for the second to be ready. Again, after the food was delivered by a very friendly server, we had to hunt down Delaney to ask for refills and dipping sauce. The only silver lining, the reason for 2 stars and not 1, was that when my food finally showed up it was delicious. The rice was kinda hard but by then I was too hungry to be that picky. Overall I am disappointed and annoyed at my time being wasted. My friend and I love coming here to eat, however after tonight I don't know the next time we will come because we spent the entire night ignored and had our time wasted by someone who clearly didn't care for her job or us.",92108

(Hope I spelled her name right) She was amazing in getting our order correct as some of our dishes changed and we like the old way better. Our drinks never emptied as we had refills right away. Our appetizers came out and immediately so did our entree's. Ashley immediately asked if we wanted new dishes after our appetizers because the food would get cold while we ate. Plus there was no room for our food on the table. We opted to have it reheated when we finished our appetizers. After noticing we were almost done Ashley had our food going and once we finished our food was delivered with no delay. This was perfect for us as we wanted to get skating as soon as possible.

914,"7077 Friars Rd San Diego, CA 92108",Holly V.,"Brooklyn, NY",5/2/2021,1,"The San Diego Fashion Valley P.F. Chang's needs to train their manager Hugo on customer service skills, accountability and the proper way to handle an escalation. We made reservations 3 weeks in advance for a party of 10. When we arrived, we were advised this location was not able to accommodate a party of 10; their tables were only able to hold 8. We would have to split our party, and the tables would not be guaranteed to be in the same section. Hugo the manager advised all hosts taking reservations over the phone are trained to advise parties more than 8 will not be able to sit together. We were not given this information over the phone, and he said that is not possible because all hosts were trained by him to give this information. I told him again, we were not advised and we would have made reservations else where. He replied ""Then you should go somewhere else that will accommodate you. I'm not bending the rules."" No apology, no accountability, just a suggestion to leave the establishment. He then stared at me without saying anything, waiting for us to accept his suggestion to leave. After his death stare, I broke the silence and asked him if he was going to apologize, or maybe attempt to seat 2 tables near each other, or some other suggestion than leaving?? Hugo became very uncomfortable and continued with his explanation of ""I am not bending the rules."" This is not how customers should be treated in an obvious miscommunication. Hugo decided it would be best for us just to leave, so he wouldn't have to deal with a confrontation. A simple apology or an attempt to try and keep 2 tables together would have been satisfactory but unfortunately Hugo is not trained properly to handle a customer escalation, and now I have taken extra time out of my schedule to advise you of what is happening at a fine establishment that is being run down by poor management. Please take the time to train your managers on how to properly handle dissatisfied customers.",92108

936,"7077 Friars Rd San Diego, CA 92108",Nick R.,"Rancho Mirage, CA",3/20/2021,2,"Normally I avoid giving low reviews, because I believe there can be such things as off days. However even if one thing is off, usually everything else is at the very least sufficient. This was not the case for this PF Chang's. Everything was kind of just... Off. Starting with the food, my S/O ordered the ""Korean Bulgolgi Steak"". This came with potatoes, which should have been a red flag from the get go as all other bulgolgi is usually served with rice and not potatoes. But whatever, gotta try new things. It took about 30 minutes for it to come. Out and when it did, the cook on the meat was wrong, it looked dry, and the server poured a bland sesame like sauce that didn't taste anything like a bulgolgi marinade. Alright. No worries, just an off day. She likes medium steak anyway and chowed down. Well, for some reason the New York Strip was chewy as all hell and dry. Like ""this has been frozen for at least 2 weeks"" dry. So not only was this New York Strip steak not korean bulgolgi, but it was a poorly taken care of New York Strip. If you are a Bulgolgi  lover like my S/O, stay the fuck away from this iteration. I ordered the Sweet and Sour Chicken with Fried Rice. Usually a solid Combo at any PF Chang's. But like. Slight problem. The Chicken was bland, and super dry as well! The sauce on top tried masking this but the sauce didn't even pack any significant flavor that I was accustomed to. No worries though, we still got the fried rice. How do you mess up fried rice? By not infusing any form of flavor into it. That's how. And my friends, this PF Chang's did just that. Flavorless fried rice withBland Sweet and Sour Chicken. This is impressively dissapointing. Best yet, the bad food review doesn't end there. The table next to us (family of 4, two small kids) also complained loudly about a Burnt Beef dish. The mother could be heard saying ""baby please don't eat that, you'll get sick"". So good to know we weren't crazy thinking the food was abysmal. Bad food wouldn't merit a 2 star review though. Why the 2 stars? Well, the service was abysmal. We were seated quickly which was a pleasant suprise, our server was super super friendly and she was genuinely great. However, I do think they were either understaffed or their kitchen was backed up, or a mix of the above. When you order your food, you will be waiting a long time. Oh and when you receive your food, you'll realize they forgot to give you silver ware or chopsticks and all of a sudden their isnt a server to be seen. That isn't even a bug deal but at this point it feels like icing on the cake.Now after all of this, there is one bright spot. Their music selection for ambulance SLAPS. Whoever's phone is playing all the music, has an amazing selection of Lo-Fi trap music and it was easily the best part of this PF Chang's Experience.",92108

And it truly upsets me to cast out this old mall favorite, a former go-to after a long day of shopping, a once-great spot for afternoon drinks and appetizers. I'm not even sure where to start - I'm actually that upset, and even gave myself a few days to cool off. But this is where we're at; SMH.It was a typical Saturday, 2pm or so, and the thought of a great PF Chang's lunch sounded right, especially after a few hours of braving mall crowds. We were seated fairly quickly, and immediately noticed a completely destroyed table next to us, replete with a high chair, piles of garbage and food all over the floor. It actually took 10 or 15 minutes for a rather upset-looking crew to police this disaster up, and not well. After a while, we were greeted, and went with some Crab Wontons and Lime Sodas to begin. The Wontons were badly over-done, and crumbled into crusty, mess-making flakes everywhere. After some time, we ordered Chicken Lo Mein and Honey Chicken, with steamed rice. Lo mein? Squishy, greasy and twice-cooked. Chicken on both? Twice cooked. All dishes were obviously pre-made and microwaved, as was the HARD and old rice. I asked for replacement rice, and you probably won't be shocked to hear what they did. Same rice, nuked with some water, with a top. I recognized the holes I had dug with my chopsticks minutes before. And still hard and old, just hot. WTF. Really? How could this be served to us with a straight face? Unforgivable.Really bad; I won't be back, and I stand corrected for ever thinking I could actually love a chain. But no more. Sadly the dynasty is over - Not recommenced.",92108

Ambiance and atmosphere:It was almost 9 PM by the time we arrived here. Seating was spacious and comfortable. There were several large groups that were finishing up their meals while we were there and were happily leaving with bags of leftover food. Sweet. There were several patrons that were picking up ""To-go"" orders. The decor at the restaurant gives it an oriental feel to it. The mural on the wall, the warrior statues throughout the restaurant all just add to a Chinese dining experience. There was adequate parking at the restaurant when we went. However I am not sure how crazy parking would be during day time hours when the stores are all open?Service:A hostess greeted us with a smile and took us to a booth. She gave us an extra set of crayons after Ian rolled his down under the table. *L* Derek was our waiter and he provided great service during our dinner. He patiently answered all our questions, recommended dishes based on our liking, explained the portion sizes on several menu items. Thanks to his suggestions we were able to order items we could almost finish eating at the restaurant. He got us extra bowls, chili oil, chili paste, packed the leftover entree, etc. Great job by him.Food:We ordered the following.Kids Fried Rice $4.50Lobster and shrimp rice. $18.95.Asian Mac and cheese. $8.50Drinks:Club soda $3.50Coconut Mojito $10.50House of Roku $12.00Total with taxes came to $62.44Ian was able to enjoy his Kids fried rice. It is an ideal portion for a hungry kid. Vegetable (Broccoli) is also a nice add to the meal. Chopsticks on the table kept him entertained for a while. *L* Asian Mac and cheese was deceivingly heavy for its portion size. Crumbs, cheese and noodles have a different texture compared to a regular mac and cheese. The truffle oil gave a unique flavor to its taste. Lobster and shrimp rice was different. I hadn't had crisp lobster with rice ever before. As a matter of fact I do not recall ever eating anything crispy with fried rice before. Somehow the crispness paired well with the soft rice and vegetables. So it was definitely worth trying out this dish. The portions of meat were not skimpy. The dish itself was generously large and for the first time in a while I had leftovers on my entree. *L* Coconut Mojito did not have anything going on for it but the House of Roku was delicious. Overall I definitely recommend this restaurant for very good service and a unique take on Oriental cuisine.",92108

However, this mistake could have cost my daughter her life. Take a look at my photo. The receipt is very clear that there is a PEANUT ALLERGY. When I got home and opened the orange peel chicken for my daughter, there was a peanut right on top of her food!!! Luckily I saw it before she started eating and it wasn't mixed in somewhere. This dish isn't even supposed to have peanuts in it! How could this happen? It almost seemed intentional. I ordered online so there was no miscommunication. Anyone with a food allergy, be very cautious when going to this restaurant, or avoid it all together. The carelessness of this is very unsettling. My daughter has a life threatening peanut allergy. I hope the restaurant learns from this. In the UK, a person died because their food contained nuts even when they explained their allergy to them. The restaurant was shut down and the owner was charged with man slaughter after a second person died for the same reason. This is not something to be taken lightly. UPDATE (8/29/19):It is nice that the company acknowledged this review by writing a reply. However, they suggested I contact their corporate office. I already contacted their corporate office almost a week ago after reading other replies to reviews with that suggestion. I have not heard from anyone.

Chang's has been a negative one. Last night I came in with a party of 7 to celebrate a family birthday. The only positive was that we received a nice table since we had made reservations but the good stops there...our server didn't smile even once during the night and was really cold which is fine and maybe just his style. One of the people in our party has an egg allergy so he requested the server to check and see which dishes he can have. Turns out every single protein is marinated in egg and therefore he couldn't have anything besides veggies or steak. Basically not the ideal restaurant for anyone with an egg allergy. I ordered the Chang's Spicy Chicken with a substitution of noodles instead of rice. It took quite a while for our food to come out and when it did it was so cold. My noodles tasted as if they had came out of the fridge. I was honestly really shocked that something like this can happen at a big restaurant where the food isn't exactly cheap. The portion of my chicken was also significantly less than the other chicken dishes at the table and when I asked the server about this he responded with ""they just used a bigger plate for yours so it looks like that"" I can assure you the plate was not any bigger than the other plates at the table...I just looked at him at that point like really? When we were trying each other's dishes at the table I realized everyone one's food was cold so they either a) left the order sitting for a while before bringing it out or b) brought out not fresh food that came out of the fridge and was stuck in a microwave and removed prematurely. The server also made an expression that I can only describe as ""yikes"" while I was telling him about my food being cold which was a little unprofessional. Fast forward through 45 minutes of miserably munching on cold, bland food in silence and the server comes with our check and just a sorry. I'm not sure how it's okay for a party to choose your restaurant for a special occasion like a birthday, have things go horribly wrong, and to just leave them with a sorry. The least they could've done was offer a dessert. I had to remind our server that we were celebrating a birthday and that it would be appreciated if he could bring a little something out for the birthday girl. We waited what felt like an eternity but was probably 30 minutes for a simple scoop of ice cream with caramel drizzle, no one sang happy birthday. We paid and left.TL;DR: Avoid if you have any allergies or dietary restrictions unless you're okay with having steamed veggies dipped in some soy sauce at an inflated price. Food is cold and bland. Service is abysmal. I recommend lighting cash on fire if it is weighing down your pockets. Panda Express offers a better experience with equivalent quality food that is less punishing on your wallet.",92108

However, our waitress was very prompt with her service and getting things cleaned. We ordered their lettuce wrap, mongolian beef, and shrimp/crab dishes. The lettuce wrap is their signature and delicious. The entrees come family style and with as much brown or white rice you desire. The taste of the entrees is mediocre and what you'd expect from an americanized Chinese restaurant, slightly better than a cheap Chinese take out restaurant but not worth triple the price of what it'd cost at one of those restaurants (~20 an entree here).

I'm glad my gf shared her chicken Lo Mein with me. That was delicious! The Asian pear mojito was a bit of a let-down as a lot of the reviews said it was really good. Every time I come here I always have to get their banana spring rolls for desert. This thing is awesome! Overall, it was a good meal.

1013,"7077 Friars Rd San Diego, CA 92108",Haylee M.,"Mountain View, CA",8/7/2019,2,"Did not meet the regular PF Chang's standard at all!Went here for dinner with friends after having had really nice experiences at other locations I've tried. Firstly, the restroom was very poorly maintained. We could smell the bad odor quite a few feet away, not something that would be expected from such a reputed chain.The service was also quite terrible. The food took forever to come out, and the server did not even fulfill the order right. I asked for the sauce on the side for my dish, and had to walk up to the host and ask them to get it. I still had to wait 5 minutes after the entree for that sauce to come, within which the food had already gotten cold. I also requested for some olive oil on the side, and they had none, which they told me when getting the sauce. So I had to wait another 3-4 minutes until they could get me butter instead.One of my friends was never asked what rice she wanted with her entree, and hence never received it. She had to wait till the server came with my sauce to place that order, and then longer for it to come. Food cold again.In terms of the actual menu items, we got the dynamite shrimp appetizer, which was just as expected, so plus points for that. None of the entrees lived up though. I got the Buddha's Feast (steamed) and it was essentially a bunch of steamed veggies with a bad sauce. The tofu was supposed to be cooked with five-spice seasoning, but I'm pretty sure it was just plain steamed tofu. No taste at all. The sauce was also terrible. Had no flavor at all. So my dinner was essentially cold, buttered veggies. Some undercooked.One of friends got the Chang's Chicken, which he said was just okay. The other one got the Ginger Chicken, which was a total letdown. It was basically boiled chicken and broccoli with sauce poured over. She was expecting a good garlic ginger flavor as was described, but there was none. The chicken was also tasteless since it was cooked separately and not with the sauce itself. She tried adding crushed red peppers to it, but it didn't help. Another bad dish.Did not have a good experience at all. Will probably not be going to this location again.",92108

We had rudely been turned away at another restaurant and came here for dinner. I'm so glad we did. We were sat rather quickly. At first we were offered a table right in front of the doors; which I didn't want to sit at because a cold gust of wind blew in everytime they opened. We let the host know our concern and that we would prefer to wait longer for another table. He was super nice about it and actually got us another table further inside the restaurant within another minute. Also, we needed a highchair and he already had it set up at the table when we got there which was great. I hate having to stand in the middle of a restaurant holding a squirming 1 yr old while waiting for a highchair so I am always so pleased when the host(ess) takes the initiative to bring it first.Our server, Wes, was great! He was pleasant and attentive and made good eye contact and smiled at us. Took time to answer a couple of my questions without making us feel like he was too busy or we were rushed. Quick to bring out our kids drinks. We didn't have to wait for refills and he boxed up our food for us at the end. A great server really makes the visit an experience. Food came out quickly and was fresh and yummy. I got the kung pao shrimp. I used to always get the kung pao scallops but it looks like they took scallops off the menu. So sad! The scallops are my favorite (bring them back!) But the shrimp did not disappoint. They were tender and the kung pao was flavorful. My husband got the tonkotsu ramen which he thought was bland. Our server brought out some chili sauce and that made it perfect. The kids portions were really good too; we got the chicken fried rice and lo mein noodles with chicken. I was impressed. We also got a cheesecake to go and it was delicious!Excellent service, excellent food, overall an excellent visit! Already looking forward to coming back again.",92108

Started off with the chicken lettuce wraps as an appetizer which are a must have when you go here. We also ordered the Mongolian Beef, Chang's spicy chicken, combo fried rice, and the long life noodles with prawns. The waiter also brought out some white rice for us to all share. It was really nice not being charged for the extra rice which i know some places tend to do. The lettuce wraps came out almost immediately after we ordered and then the rest of our dishes came out after. The Chang's spicy chicken wasn't spicy at all but all of the dishes were good and pretty good sized. It did take some time for us to get our check after we had finished eating because our waiter was scrambling to help several tables as it had gotten a little busier.

Was it ready at 4:15PM...no more like 6:15PM. Despite the long wait times I believe P.F. Chang's (FASHION VALLEY LOCATION) did the best they could. They were hustling getting orders out, maybe not the orders of the people who were waiting at the restaurant but they have no control over the order these meals were place or how impacted they would be. I understand many people are frustrated but they are forgetting we are in a pandemic and this is the new normal. Wait times are going to be HIGHER than usual especially when they are solely doing TOGO orders. The same goes for when you got to a grocery/regular store these days, you're going to wait a long time to get in and check out. This is the reality we are living in. If you don't like it or are not going to social distance eat at home, simple as that. Could P.F. Chang's have been better prepared? Sure, but this is a learning experience for everyone. Next major holiday it would be s good idea to not use any third party delivery, this will eliminate the unnecessary component of confusion. Also I would strictly do prepaid orders, I noticed lots of orders were no-shows. Maybe people who hadn't paid saw the lines and left leaving the customers who were there to see the food becoming angered thinking it's their food. Just some tips, take them or leave them. Lol. I want to thank everyone who worked yesterday during Mothers Day, I can only imagine the stress, rude customers and tiredness you guys experience. Through it all you guy kept your heads up, did your best with what you had. I am not sure if my family was just starving, but the food was great. We had to wait a little longer, but made the best of the situation. I am looking forward to the day where we can dine in. You have a loyal customer here, again thank you guys.

Lastly, they have a big bowl of fortune cookies at the front, which I shamelessly helped myself to both before and after dinner. The reason why it's a 3 star review is because I just can't really get into the food, which is why we went in the first place. I feel like it's expensive for what you get, and the flavors are just off. The Lo Mein was not tasty. The main courses were ok, but nothing that made me say, ""hey we need to come back for this.""

Don't ask me why but we had craving for chicken and so we ordered the orange peel chicken, sesame chicken, and yes Chang's spicy chicken. Just to make sure we had some beef on the menu we had to get the Mongolian beef. I must say the chicken selections were all good and I would not say I had a favorite. The Spicy chicken may sway me a bit as it was soft and the spicy chili sauce was just right (not too bland and not too spicy). I can definitely taste the pineapple in the Sweet & Sour chicken which is not a bad thing. I am a fan of the only beef we had ordered... the Mongolian beef was delicious with the hint of garlic and definitely went well with my fried rice.

We had heard rumors of their world famous boba and knew we had to try this delicious elixir. Our hopes were high and so were we - but we were quickly brought back to reality when confronted with the un-amusing size of the so called boba balls - the size of their balls mirrors our respect for their beverage game. We trudged our way through disappointing lettuce wraps, just yearning for a taste of that LO MEIN. As vegetarians, we went with the shrimp option. But ALAS, we took a bite of the noodles to find it had been secretly spiked with our two-legged friends!! You read that right: they put CHICKEN in our greasy noodle.

We got our food in within a good amount of time. We got our appetizers right away, then had our entrees. Since I was there for my birthday, they offered a free little dessert treat for me, which was a pleasant surprise. The atmosphere was also nice, quiet and it's a bit on the dimmer side type of ambiance.The price is closer to $20 per entree (if you're including tax already). The portion is decent and we were full after ordering 2 happy hour appetizers and 2 entree. If you want to try out this place, make sure you sign up for their emailing list, so you get BOGO free entree, which is what we did. If you do not, your bill could add up quickly. If you're on a budget, I do not recommend this place.The taste is where the stars starts dropping for me. I got the spicy tuna and there was so much vinegar on the rice (I guess), I had to check the soy sauce if it was balsamic vinegar. The vinegar taste got so strong after having only a couple of the sushi. That really threw me off.The entrees were A-OK. I got the chicken fried rice and beef a la sichuan. The chicken fried rice was a bit bland and the beef a la sichuan was alright. I find that the taste were underwhelming. It wasn't bad, nor was it great. For the money you spend, you could get a lot more quantity and flavor if you just go to a mom and pop's Chinese Restaurant down the street.This was my first experience with them and will be my last.

In reality, he was great! He saw that we were sharing stories and catching up. He alwys kept our drinks fresh and checked in on us as appropriate. This was my third time dining here and my best experience his far.  It's not a write home to mom and dad experience, but a solid place to have lunch or dinner with co-workers or friends.",92108

When I got to the front of the line, the cashier said it would be another 35-40 minutes as they had not started the order yet. Ummmm that would mean you're asking me, a MOTHER, on MOTHER'S DAY to wait an hour to pick up food when your app states my food has been ready for pickup for the last 20 minutes?

It was Saturday night and I thought reservations would help.When we arrived the line of waiting customers was out the door. When we finally made it to the front desk we were asked for our reservations details. The hosted said that it was a good idea to come with reservations because the wait was about one hour. Our wait would be around 20 minutes !?? What is the point ? We left and picked a restaurant with no wait just around the corner.

Edamames, the tempura shrimp rolls & the chicken lettuce wraps... they were all ok... but after hearing about the lettuce wraps for years, I was expecting them to be spectacular... eh... not so much. I've had better lettuce wraps at smaller places.For the entrees we ordered the Crispy Honey Chicken, the Mongolian Beef, the Kung Pao Chicken & the shrimp & chicken fried rice... it was all... ok.

However tonight was an absolute disappointment   My kids tookme for my birthday celebration. They were asked three timss if they  were celebrating  something special. They said yes my moms birthday. They figured it was forgotten by our server as she brought the check  without acknowledging  the birthday. When they went to the hostess she asked what our table number was. Ummm how would we know. The hostess figured it out and went to the server. She took another twenty minutes and brought over ice cream and banana thing with a candle in it. Still no acknowledgment of the birthday just dropped off dessert. On top of it water was dumped in both my purse and my daughter in laws purse. The  server saw this and wiped up the floor but did not offer napkins  or anything   I had to get up and ask  for something to clean it  up. A bit disastrous and worse service I've ever had at any PF Chang's. This iss definitely not the norm. Top it off still have zero knowledge of our servers name. So I did exactly what they asked me to do. Go one the website. Yet they have not contacted me as of yet. Seriously? So very disappointed in PF Chang's.,92108
1076,"7077 Friars Rd San Diego, CA 92108",Amanda A.,"Clearwater, FL",5/13/2018,5,"So I've given it over a year for this location to get better. It has not. I think there is a massive management problem here. When management does not care and is condescending to customers, then that means the quality of staff will not be good either. I often find the waitstaff and bartenders here are aggravated with each other, and customers. The quality of food is extremely inconsistent, as well as the portion sizes for what you pay. The last straw for me ever wanting to come to this location occurred yesterday when it not only took forever for our food to come out when the restaurant was not that busy (the server said they had a large party to serve - okay, but the restaurant was half full - you can't handle an at-capacity restaurant?) and my order of course came out wrong. But no readers, the supervisor at the time accosted myself and my husband accusing us of using an expired gift card. Even after showing him that we were just gifted it that morning, we were still given an exasperated attitude and treated like we were doing something wrong. The approach lacked any hint of ""I want to keep this customer"" so you know what? I will never step foot through these doors again. You embarrass a longtime customer in front of other guests? No thanks. I'll take my money to YardHouse down the street. PS - your restrooms are disgusting.

This is after I spoke with someone and they took my order and told me to be there in 20 minutes.Tonight I placed an order at 5:15pm through Grubhub and received notification that the order had been received and accepted. I then got notification it was being made. At 6:45 I received word from the driver and grub hub- the restaurant was busy and only accepting eat in and pick up orders (what's the difference between pick up and grub hub?).

I have been living in CA for seven years, and this is the first time I feel how horrible it is to experience an ASIAN STEREOTYPE. We wait at least for 10 minutes to order, when my sister call him for ordering our food, he was saying 'who do you think you are', 'I don't care what country you come from' those kind of words and being very rude to us. We called the manager here and say what we need is only an apology. Surprisingly, the manager doesn't really care about our case. And even ask us to leave if we don't accept her suggestion (just switch to another server, and nothing else). I don't want to lower my head just because I came from another country. We just want to be equal treated as other customers. I believe this is not so hard, right? How funny it is to be Asian stereotyped in an Asian restaurant.",92108

Chang's food (sushi, chicken) left on a table, under a canopy by the staff. Skewers for self-serving, during this pandemic, were even spilling out of box, onto the ground.After nearly 2 hours the Manager comes out and takes down everyone's name to verify that orders are in the cue but NEVER RETURNS.Shortly after this,  a group questions staff due to no communication.  At this time the manager approaches the group and says, ""Now I'm going to try to say this as nice as I can..."" to a crowd of clients.  Followed by turning the tables on the crowd as if we were to blame.  Once again, stating all orders were being worked on.  At this time, multiple orders are walking out the right door - the Third Party Delivery door.  The parking lot is emptied and yet, here we still sit/stand.  Some waiting since 5:30pm.  Also, please note bathrooms were blocked. Wine was for sale but no water.Approx. 8:55pm: My husband and I observe waitresses throwing away DOZENS of orders that had remained on the bar/counter for hours - no one picking them up or being called out.Three hours in... I'm told I cannot take pictures of the staff not wearing masks outside of kitchen.  That I am breaking the law.  I am standing too close to my husband. Again, turning the table, refusing ownership of the situation and using a belittling tone while speaking in a condescending, rude manner.10:00pm:  They begin cooking our food. and we are shortly, thereafter, on our way home.  An email is received later with a refund stating, ""Customer no longer wants order"".This manager was so rude, dismissive and altogether UNPROFESSIONAL.  She endangered her clients with the food on the outside table.  Her staff did not (in part) wear their masks while near the kitchen.  -- since then I have reviewed pics now that I have glasses on and can zoom.... there were two people in kitchen exposing their noses and not under a mask.I'm sure I've left off a fact or two but I think you get the idea of her blatant disregard for the experience and HEALTH of your clients.  It was appallingPics available for corporate office if requested.",92108

Figured a line of cars indicated curbside, so placed my car in the line and proceeded to wait. Eventually, the line snaked back almost to the Cheese Cake factory. This was not a fast moving line, instead an average of one curbside pre-order was being filled every thirty minutes. Yep, I counted five cars ahead of me receive their orders between 4:30-7. Management was non existent and the restaurant's telephone had a pre-recording that eventually hung up on the caller. I finally gave up, headed to a different restaurant and received a drive up order in less than 20 minutes. I had pre-paid for my order for 4 that included a 20 percent tip for the workers. I guess that the restaurant made out pretty well, since most of the cars in the pre-ordered and pre-paid curbside pick-up line gave up like I did.

Changs for dinner every year on New Year's Eve and we knew that just because we moved doesn't mean we need to stop a tradition. This is the first time we have come to this location so we had no idea what the size was or how busy it would be so I made a reservation online the week before for 7:30 PM and it was super simple. When we got there we were surprised that the location was smaller than we expected given their location in such a busy area but they seemed to do well with turning tables quickly. We did have a short wait before we could be seated even though we had reservations and it took about 10 minutes. Once we were seated our waiter came over and introduced himself and he was soooo nice it was weird. I know that servers have to be nice but some clearly are nice because it is there job but I am pretty sure this person was genuinely nice and I would probably want him to be my friend.The menu has changed since the last time we dinner here but it was still a good selection and we were able to find what we wanted right away. The meals are served family style but my husband and I aren't good at sharing so we kept what we ordered to ourselves. Adam got sesame chicken with white rice and I got Changs spicy chicken with brown rice. We also got chicken lettuce wraps as a starter. Our food came out incredibly quick. It took about 10 minutes for our lettuce wraps to come out and about 7 minutes after they came out with our entrees. The lettuce wraps were perfect as always but they always seem to give too much lettuce. I never mind because with the leftovers I always cut the lettuce up and make a salad out of it with the sauce as the dressing. We both loved our meals. They were cooked to perfection and my meal had just the right amount of spice. The chickens both had a great amount of flavor. The rice is also unlimited so don't be shy in getting more. We both made sure we have a fresh serving to go with our leftovers that we had for lunch the next day. With the meals, 2 drinks and a started the meal was about $35 per person which is something that can be expected and we were super happy with our experience here however as we have aged we have realized that we don't need anything fancy and we don't feel like we have to do something just because it is New Year's Eve so in the future we will probably go to Pei Wei for out New Year's Eve meal. We are huge fans of Pei Wei and they are owned by the same company so now that we have discovered Pei Wei it is likely that is where we will go and then we can bring it home and eat on our couch and pretend we can stay up until midnight from home.If you want to go out and you want waiter service I do highly suggest coming here. They are quick and they are good. I have never been disappointed in a P.F. Changs and I don't think I ever will be.",92108
1100,"7077 Friars Rd San Diego, CA 92108",Charles C.,"San Diego, CA",1/6/2018,2,"I have dined at many branches of P.F. Chang's over the years, including Mission Valley, La Jolla Village, Irvine Spectrum, Long Beach and Los Angeles.  They each have a slight variance, one to the other, despite the corporate strait jacket to which they all must heed.  For example, the Irvine Spectrum branch has a beautifully-proportioned room in the back with its walls lined in wine bottles, which I call the ""Wine Room"" [I do not believe that is the designation the restaurant gives it]. To dine in that room pleased me more than any other P. F. Chang's décor of which I have visited.  The Mission Valley branch has always been special to visitors from Tijuana, particularly on Sunday afternoons, when the family piles into the big black Escalade in Tijuana, motors across the frontera to Fashion Valley, with the wives being dropped off at the Mall to hit Neiman Marcus and Hermes, while the husband takes the kids to the Zoo or Sea World. Thereafter, they all rendez-vous in late afternoon at P.F. Chang's for an early dinner, before heading back across the border laden with their treasures. I am not sure when it all seemed to collapse for the P.F. Chang's group. It seems as if it were several years ago. Someone perceptively stated it was when the servers stopped the pleasantry of mixing the sauces for you at the outset of your meal. That could be it. The portion size of the food was reduced. Servers were assigned to a greater number of tables, so service consequently suffered.  At one point interesting specials and new dishes were added to the menu; then all that stopped.  Yes, it is the Art of Falling Apart.That brings me to last night at P.F. Chang's Mission Valley. I parked in the little lot behind the restaurant and entered, as is my custom, through the ""secret"" side door. I immediately noticed the door handle was greasy [waiters come and go from that same door to service the guests on the patio, so perhaps that was the reason]. There were two adjacent open seats at the bar, where someone had previously dined. I sat in front of their dirty dishes and plates and cups for a good ten minutes before a passing bartender decided to inquire ""Is this yours?"" I responded ""no"", and he proceeded to clear the dishes and wipe down the bar. He handed me a Happy hour menu that was as greasy and stained as the door handle had been, as well as the regular menu. It was actually more cost-effective to order a bottle of the low-end Chardonnay than to order wine by the glass, even with the Happy Hour prices in place, so I went that route. I knew I may never see the bartender again, so I ordered right then and there: Kung Pao Chicken with snap peas added, with brown rice. My food took quite awhile to come out, to the point where I was about to cancel my food order and simply pay for the wine and leave. I actually had to do that once at the La Jolla Village branch. At that time, as soon as I cancelled my order, the platinum blonde manager was at my side personally delivering the food. She stated the charge had been removed from my bill, but they would have to throw it out anyway so she brought it to me.  I declined her offer of the free dish, since I was leaving to return to work after the long delay, nicely advising her to ""please give it to the dogs"". I later became friends with that manager, who tried her best that day. Not surprisingly, she subsequently moved on to another restaurant in downtown La Jolla. Back to yesterday at P.F. Chang's Mission Valley. The food was delivered [surprise-surprise!], and I enjoyed it. It was generally how I remember it [I no longer go to P.F. Chang's with any regularity]. A cashier at Target La Mesa had recently commented to me that the Chocolate Dome dessert at P.F. Chang's was ""the best dessert she had ever eaten in her life"". Accordingly, I had to try it, since I believe in fate.  However, I was presented not with a miracle, but rather with a hard little frozen ball, tasting nicely of chocolate, yes, but frigidly straight from the freezer. I took only one bite.A woman in a baseball cap and shorts came into the bar area and inquired of me if the open seat next to me was available, and I nodded affirmatively.  My new baseball-capped neighbor ordered a small hot and sour soup and two Happy Hour appetizers to go, which the bartender acknowledged. However, when the kitchen waitress arrived arrived with the food, she set the soup down in front of my neighbor while my neighbor was protesting it was all to be ""to go"". Nonetheless, the kitchen waitress remained oblivious to the protests and proceeded to place the two appetizers on the bar, including one right at MY place setting [my neighbor put her arm around me at that point and whispered ""She thinks we are together!""]  The waitress then vanished into the kitchen, leaving the issue to the hapless bartender to resolve.  I do not know how that scenario ended, since at that point I took off, leaving P.F. Chang's to handle its own disasters.",92108

Insane, unorganized hectic way they run this place. Never will return to this location!I left a review on yelp but then had a response from PF Chang's team to ask to have me leave my experience on their website to then have someone reach out to me, I went ahead and did that yet I never had anyone reach out.

We ordered the ahi poke, chicken lettuce wraps, Mongolian beef, crispy honey shrimp, fried rice, and spicy garlic green beans. All delicious, highly recommended!

As soon as we were seated Travis came to great us promptly and so nice! I don't know how they changed the servers attitudes and their customer service but man were they all attentive and unbelievably polite! Felt like dining in the most upscale of restaurants with out the cost. Travis was fantastic!! He made recommendations and commented on our choices to assure we made good ones. He never left us too long and noticed all the signs like; ready for boxes and ready for the check. Sadly he also noticed that we couldn't stop eating the calamari and we weren't going to take it so he said he'd leave it while he grabbed the check... ugh, fine.... we'll finish it (not much arm twisting there!).

1113,"7077 Friars Rd San Diego, CA 92108",Michael G.,"San Diego, CA",1/4/2018,2,"I am quite disappointed with tonights dinner at P.F. Chang's. Besides the fact that the portion size in relation to the price seems a bit off the service was terrible. I never typically write a review when I'm seated at the bar for dinner because personally I feel you don't get a true representation of the quality of service the restaurant provides. I say that because often the bar tender is one of the busiest workers in the restaurant responsible for all the patrons at the bar in addition to making the drinks for everyone else in the restaurant. Those who have worked in the industry would probably agree. With that being said you should expect the service to be a bit inferior however tonight the restaurant and the bar area was not very busy. If the bartenders have enough time to joke around, socialize with one another and take breaks one would expect they would have time to offer you another drink, check back to see how your meal was tasting or even see if you wanted something else such as desert or another drink prior to tossing the bill down in front of you. Russell think about how much more of a tip you potentially could have got if say we had three or four more drinks and possibly some dessert as we planned. I find it extremely disrespectful to be given a bill without even being asked how everything tasted. Not even a fortune cookie offered from a Chinese restaurant. Hopefully this is not a representation of how the restaurant is now training there employees because in the past the experience has been far more enjoyable.",92108

Multiple times I have order on the online and had to wait more than 30 minutes past the time I was given.  Most recently we were in line to pick up our take out and watched worker after worker go by. No one stopped to help any of the four people in the pick up line. Finally my husband got someone's attention and they went and got someone to help else.  It seems like the servers are too busy flirting with each other, tossing their hair, and slapping each other's a$$es than helping customers.  Sad because I really enjoy the food but it pains me that this location is not up to the usual PF Chang's standard.  Someone needs to get better control of their staff and start working on their customer service.",92108

I lived in Japan almost two years and a half, my wife lived there for 3 years, and grew up there as a child. I grew up eating authentic Ramen, and edamame, and things like dumplings. Needless to say, I know a thing or two of Asian cuisine, at least Japanese cuisine which they happen to have in menu. Their Tonkotsu ramen was horrendous. The noodles were mushy and had a similar texture to overcooked soggy pasta. The broth tasted generic and had little to no flavor, and tasted as if some sort of cream was intentionally added to create a little ""spunk"". The broth is the most important key part of any different type of ramen. If you mess that up, then mess up the Ramen. Clearly, this establishment doesn't put forth the same effort into authentic and traditional way of make real ramen, as they do non-chalantly making it a high price. A real bowl of Ramen wouldn't cost as much as they do here. The broth was horrible and the noodles were even worse and mushy. The edamame was dry, had no flavor, and tasted as if it had been sitting out all day under a lamp. The pork dumplings.. where do I begin. I don't know what is with this place but they were 2 for 2 for making something so horribly mushy. The dumplings had no flavor, no spice, no anything, and to make it worse it felt as if I was eating a Sour Patch Kid gummy! It was horrible. For those seeking true and real Chinese/Japanese cuisine, I'd recommend going else where to a mom and pop shop. You'll be sure to save an enormous amount of money, and will have a better experience than this watered down ""Asian"" restaurant. Bad first experience for my wife and I, and will never be returning. I spent almost $80.00 for those three things along with 1 drink each. You won't spend that much at a real Asian restaurant. Don't be fooled people.",92108

EVERY TIME! savory and sweet tender chicken over crunchy rice noodles served with perfectly fresh, crunchy iceberg lettuce and served with a delicious sauce. I wish they could be delivered to my door daily. although I am a huge fan of hot & sour soup, there's doesn't hit the spot for me. too much sour and not enough heat, and there never seems to be enough filling. I wish there were more tofu egg and mushrooms to fill the cup rather than just the sour broth. it does have a nice flavor, just not amazing compared to many others I have had. tonight we had the Mongolian beef and the Kung pao chicken which was the perfect combo of savory and spice. beware the kung pao might be a bit too hot for some peoples liking. and sadly, for once, we were so hungry we forgot to take pictures of the entrees. for dessert we got the banana spring rolls which were extremely good!

He sent me a text and said he is not waiting any more, by this time, there were over 50 people waiting-and still no one coming out to give any information or updates. He finally got to talk to someone when they brought another customer's food out and told them he wanted to cancel.  Then they told him they couldn't even find his name!  At that point, many other people said they wanted to cancel.  We went to the store and I cooked my own Mother's Day meal.  What a fiasco.  Sent a message to corporate, but haven't heard back.  Won't be going there again.",92108

The managers, the servers, and the chefs make P.F. Chang's an all-around amazing experience. The managers operate the restaurant effectively, and always do their best to make sure you are taken care of. The manager, Anthony, has been an essential part of me enjoying the restaurant. You can always find him on the floor speaking with his customers with a great sense of detail to ensure that they have the best experience possible. There is an obvious tempo and 'flow' of the restaurant whenever he is working.Justin, Chase, Justice, Rosanne, Joshua, and Julie are all great servers that go above and beyond in what they do. Ask for any of them in order to be taken care of.Lastly, the CHEFS know what they are doing. The food tastes amazing and always comes out promptly. It is REALLY good food! The drinks are great also.Before my first time trying P.F. Chang's, I believed it was overrated. I was proven wrong thanks to the dedicated staff that work here. Thank you P.F. Chang's!!",92108

So receiving a 14oz drink in a 20oz cup is unsatisfactory. (Yes, I measured it!). I didn't ask and pay for ice, I asked and payed for the ginger beer drink. ***HIGHLY doubtful I'd get reimbursed for not having exactly what I ordered.For a place like this to not pay attention to detail is very disappointing, especially for the price we pay for the food. .",92108

When our server let us know that the kitchen was running behind, we decided not to order an any entrees and asked for the check, which came promptly. I took that to mean, ""Get the f-k out!""

The service from Door Dash was wonderful! The dish I ordered (chicken lettuce wraps) was HORRIFIC!!! As soon as I opened the container for the chicken filling, the smell of burnt food hit me in the face!! Just looking at the filling, anyone can see it's burnt! Practically completely black in color and a bitter taste!! Why would a restaurant have the nerve to pack burnt food up and think it is ok to serve to a paying customer? I called the restaurant to address my concern. Asked to speak with the manager. A Melissa (the manager) got on the line in a rushed manner asking how she can assist me. Immediately I was irritated with her rushing me in telling her what my problem was. Told her I received burnt food and all she can say was sorry you did. She offered for me to come by to get another order. That was not an option cause I'm at work. Which is why I used Door Dash service to begin with!

My expectations wasn't really high, as I've always like going to mom and pop Chinese restaurants since their Chinese food is fresh and delicious.Going inside it's pleasant and modern as usual for most P.F. Changs. It's not too fancy but not too casual, kind of a ""medium-high"" interior design of what is considered modern today. We were seated at a table (I preferred a booth but they were full) and was serviced by a nice lady that started us off with some waters. To be honest I wasn't 'dressed' for the part, as I was just wearing my workout clothes since I've hit the gym this morning, so my tank top and shorts made me really stand out from the crowd of collared shirts and semi-formal skirts haha!We ordered the Beef a la Sichuan, Beef and Broccoli, and BBQ Spare Ribs. The taste had equaled my expectations from when we set food into the door. It wasn't a wow factor for sure, but it was decent. The Beef a la Sichuan was a bit too salty and the beef was pretty hard. The Beef and Broccoli was fine, but the beef was a little salty as well, probably from the sauce they put onto the entree. The spare ribs was probably the one that was the best from the three. The Asian sauce gave it a nice sweet flavor and the rib meat was soft enough to almost just be pulled from the bone, which is the way ribs are supposed to be made (debatable to some, but it's my own personal preference).Overall, the dining experience was nice and semi-formal. Service was good. Food was meh. Price? Definitely overpriced for what you get/quality. $60 damage which made me think I could get a lot better quality food for that price and bigger quantities. I can compare many mom and pop Chinese restaurants that has better quality food, but of course you don't get the modern dining experience if that's your taste. Would I come back? Maybe if there's a special occasion, but I will consider other places first before this one.",92108

I have never been to PF Changs but I always heard good things. They started delivering via amazon now and on a rainy night I was craving some takeout and decided to finally try some PF Changs. Now this is a review of their VEGETARIAN items only. They might have great meat options but I know I like to get a sense of the vegetarian options before I eat somewhere. It seems like its pretty simple to make asian food vegetarian or even vegan. Heck, even local mom and pop places are offering lots of vegan options. Their vegetarian menu is quite small but it seemed tasty enough. I ordered the fried rice, vegetarian lettuce wraps, vegetable egg rolls and the yellow vegetable curry.  Everything arrived hot, and fresh but it was just not good. I write a lot of reviews and I hate giving under 3 stars unless its just terrible but its honestly just not good. I would rather even eat at panda express and thats low. The lettuce wrap sauce is so weird, the taste is intensely smokey and sour it was just odd. Whatever the little pieces are in the lettuce wraps were weird hard tofu chunks? It would almost be better to just have raw vegetables as the filling. The fried rice was ok, 3 star at best but so overly salty. And the egg rolls were also just ok, nothing special but for $8 I expected something different. The yellow vegetable curry was so bland. It needed salt badly. Out of all the items the yellow curry was the best but even at its best I would never eat here again based on this selection.Maybe you meat eaters out there love it but for vegetarians I would say stay clear.",92108

1203,"7077 Friars Rd San Diego, CA 92108",Jenn W.,"San Diego, CA",7/15/2018,3,"Update: Against my better judgement we attempted to go again last night.  Upon checking in I let the hostess know of our recent experience. She apologized and assured us this time would be better. We were seated within the timeframe given. The hostess seating us had to sweep the mess under the table. After that the server, drinks, food and check all came within a timely manner. The food...I feel like the quality has gone down. It wasn't long ago that this restaurant was known for really great food. However I feel like everything tastes sweet, not true Chinese at all. I expect spicy chicken to have a little heat, however it was more sweet. The beef broccoli was great, but again the beef was a little sweet, but the lo mein was great! I can't say we'll be back again but I'm glad we gave it another shot. First review: Literally just walked out. After heading in for a late dinner after a movie, we were seated in a timely manner however the waitstaff was everywhere but at our table to take drink orders or otherwise. I had already mentioned to my date that the place has taken on a upscale Chili's vibe. Hallway to bathrooms, trash was swept into the corner and from what I'm told the men's bathroom was disgusting... step your game up PF",92108

1205,"7077 Friars Rd San Diego, CA 92108",Angela C.,"La Palma, CA",1/5/2018,1,"To start off, the one star is for the lettuce wraps being tasty and for the kind attitude of our server. However, there were so many things that weren't great today. I got the lunch combo that came with the lettuce wraps and any side appetizer, so I chose hot and sour soup. One of the servers (not our main server) brought me my appetizer first, which looked great. As I went to grab the spoon that specifically came with the soup, I noticed it felt sticky. I looked down and saw a used spoon with dried food on the backside (photo). I was utterly disgusted to see that either this restaurant does not clean their utensils well, or whoever served me my soup carelessly grabbed a used spoon and threw it on my serving dish. It took about 15-20min for our actual server to check up on us, and for me to be able to ask for a new spoon. Even she was shocked to see how dirty it was. Again, she was still kindhearted so she took the entire appetizer back and told me that she'd bring a new one. The same male server that brought me my first soup brought me the new set instead, but he nonchalantly placed the soup in front of me and left. No apologies or acknowledgements whatsoever?? RUDE. But at this point, I was just happy to have a clean spoon and a bowl of soup. We finished our meals and waited to get to-go containers and our check. I saw that our server was at the table beside us, packing up the food individually for that family. It was a kind gesture, but she was moving SO SLOW and we had to leave soon. Once she finished, I grabbed her attention and asked her if we could also get two to-go containers and our check. She took about 15-20 min... I don't know what she was doing in the back, but it was an unnecessary amount of time for the task at hand. Now I saw that the other table she tended to got nice plastic containers, so that's what I was expecting when she instead brought out a paper Chinese box and ziplock bags... ZIPLOCK BAGS (photo). Is this normal?? Because I definitely did not understand the difference in treatment and service. I might be overthinking things because we were the only Asian group out of all the other White customers (also all White workers), but our service just seemed incredibly appalling at an overall perspective. Never have I ever had such a vile restaurant experience where I was given dirty kitchenware, ziplock bags, and SLOW service. I hope that no one else goes through what me and my party had to go through today. Definitely do NOT recommend this place. Spend your good money elsewhere, it'll do you well. Ps. Spoons aren't given unless you get a dish that requires a spoon, so I had no choice but to wait for a new spoon because I was NOT going to be using the dirty one.",92108

The food wasn't good nor bad, it just wasn't anything special to me. The shrimp with lobster sauce was my favorite because the sauce was so creamy and it went great with brown rice on the side. I also added a spritz of lime to the Street Noodles (rice noodles, light curry sauce, shrimp, chicken, and veggies) which gave it a really good kick. Lastly, the fried rice was pretty basic and I've honestly had better. As for the service, Hannah was great and she checked up on us whenever she could! I docked off an additional star because the hostess told us the wait was around 30 min and even gave us a buzzer to hold on to, however after an hour it never went off and when we went back to check on our name they said they had called us and taken our name off the list. Didn't really see the point of having a buzzer that didn't work, maybe try calling or texting next time?",92108

It's not 100% authentic Chinese cuisine, but it doesn't mean to be, and in reality it's close enough. The Korean Stir Fry and the Sichuan Beef are my two favorites, and the lettuce wraps deserve an honorable mention. The strawberry cucumber limeade is my favorite non-alcoholic drink here.The only thing that irked me a little on my last visit was that the server asked to take my phone to redeem my rewards. I said it was fine, thinking she would just go to the station and enter it on the computer. But she walked around the whole restaurant and disappeared for a few minutes before coming back with my phone. I'm sure there are simpler ways of handling rewards!",92108

1214,"7077 Friars Rd San Diego, CA 92108",Kevin R.,"San Diego, CA",11/9/2019,1,I finally decided to leave a review. In general I really like P.F. Chang's.. the food I get is usually pretty good but I've as 3 instances at this particular location that I'm going to write about. The last two times that I ordered food to go (which I picked up) I had some sketchy pieces of chicken that seemed like they were previously frozen (which I assume they are) and then weren't fully cooked. As in most of my meal was hot and these few pieces were actually kind of cold. Now.. for last nights adventure.We went to P.F. Chang's and sat at the bar. First of all the food from the previous people that Had eaten there was still sitting there and the people next to it said they had left a while ago so the seats were open. Within 30 seconds of sitting there a ROACH ran across the bar right there in front of me. Now this was not a large roach that could of flown and landed there from outside. This was a small roach which 99% of the time means infestation. Gross. We left and the people right next to us who had also just sat down left. Disgusting. I will probably not be eating at this location again until I see somehow that they have addressed this roach infestation. I am also going to be looking for their letter grade from the San Diego Dept of public health. They better not have an A.. not with roaches crawling across the bar literally right in front of me where I would have been eating. They should be appalled at the Friars road location. Disappointed PF Chang's. Disappointed.,92108

Food:The dynamite shrimp was absolutely decadent and our favorite of the night, it was so delicious.The hot and sour soup was good but not warm enough.The sea bass I ordered lacked flavor, I ended up taking most of it home and eating it the next day. It was cooked great but just lacked flavor.The surf and turf my fiancée got looked great and he said it was really good, especially the filet mignon.We both shared a mini chocolate dessert that was okay but we both liked that it was a very small portion and hit the spot.We both enjoyed our time but you have to make a reservation otherwise you're looking at a 90 mom wait.",92108

Luckily for me, I had a server named An, and she was as good as they get. She no doubt made my evening more pleasant and enjoyable with her cordial and resolute personality. To start, I asked An to bring me an order of their happy hour pork dumplings, three at $3.25, H.H. Northern Style Spare Ribs for $6.00, and for my main course, I decided to try their Seasonal Vietnamese Noodles with vegetables, Flank Steak, and Shrimp for $12.95. (yelp.com/biz_photos/p-f-…)The pork dumplings came steamed in small dim sum container (yelp.com/biz_photos/p-f-…). They were filled with tender and savory pork with a hint of garlic and scallion. (yelp.com/biz_photos/p-f-…) An mixed the three ingredients from the condiment container and made me a great medium spicy dipping sauce. Well, it was just the perfect companion for the dumplings. (yelp.com/biz_photos/p-f-…) Great start to my dinner.The Northern Spare Ribs came with a side of 5 spice dry rub were great. They came with a great amber color and were very tender. (yelp.com/biz_photos/p-f-…) Their flavor profile was no doubt elevated with the dry rub: a clear intention. (yelp.com/biz_photos/p-f-…) Unfortunately, these little ribs did not last very long under my domain.The Vietnamese Noodles were flavorful, with its light hoisin, sriracha, cinnamon and coriander sauce and filled with healthy vegetables. I was especially fond of the Chinese broccoli rab and crunchy onions. The flank steak and shrimp were expertly prepared, well seasoned, and very tender. (yelp.com/biz_photos/p-f-…) I thought the dish however needed more beef, but the shrimp were just the right amount, and quite tasty indeed.

She got all our orders on time and food came out all together. Great server. Food: food was just okay. We got the tempura cauliflower for an appetizer. It was salty and a bit mushy. We got ginger beers! Probably the best thing about the meal because you could taste the fresh squeezed ginger. The main dish we got white Rice, veggie lo mein, Mongolian beef, and eggplant veggie dish. Each dish was super salty! Just way to salty! Good thing I had the ginger beer! The Mongolian beef was a bit hard to chew and the onions too powerful. The eggplant was slimy and mushy. The lo mein was a bit greasy and too salty. Few veggies in it as well.

If a guest complained about how long they've been waiting they would just seat them right away to get them out of the way. The rude hostess with red scarf never once apologized for her attitude instead she would turn to her coworkers and talk crap about the customer. Once I confronted them about the way time they sat us right away even though there was a couple next to us who had been waiting much longer.

That being said, I had a gift card AND a coupon, so boyfriend and I found ourselves here. We shared the: -pork egg rolls AND chicken egg rolls. They're hard to tell apart but I think the pork ones are more delicious. They're wrapped in a wonton wrapper instead of the spring roll wrapper and I was so into it. The sauce on the side is a little overpowering but I liked it anyway. -honey shrimp: Basically panda's honey walnut shrimp without walnuts. I quite liked it for what it was! -orange peel chicken: this was juicy and tasty and I quite liked this too!Overall, I liked everything but would not come back unless i had another gift card.

Food orders were ""Lost"". The bride to be asked to speak with the manager at this point. The manager literally blamed all her problems on the kitchen! When actually the problem was they obviously under staffed. Said manager never came back to help this poor guy. Then to top it off they sat another table. Our reservation was for 5:00pm. It is 9:11pm and we're still trying to pay our bill and leave. Multiple people spoke to the manager about the lack of customer service. If I could give them a negative rating I would!

Sweet and Sour pork (flavor was good, but the battered fried pork was a little on the  soggy side).3.) P.F. Chang's pork fried rice. ( Hit the spot)4.) Kid's sweet and sour chicken.

Nothing was as good as it once was. The food is overpriced and for what you're receiving I wouldn't even pay Panda Express prices. The crab wontons had a weird taste. The egg roll filling was just salty mush. The Mongolian Beef was bland. The crispy honey chicken had a gooey and soggy coating while the sauce tasted like vinegar. The chicken lo mein was just spaghetti tossed with soy sauce and a few vegetable pieces with some doughy chicken pieces. Can they not fry chicken thoroughly? The waitstaff is great and sure the restaurant looks nicer than a Chinese takeout but if you want good Chinese food: look elsewhere.,92108

If I had come on my own, I probably would not of had the opportunity to try so many things like I did yesterday with appetizers flowing, my meal, dessert, etc. The Calamari and lettuce wraps appetizers were to die for and my favorites. I ended up ordering the tempera sushi roll for my meal which was good- but was not great. Next time I want to try something else.  The dessert I ordered was the great wall of chocolate I believe its called. Its a layered chocolate cake slice which is far more than a slice. Its like half a cake! no kidding. I shared with other girls at the table with us and took some home. Crazy how big it was. It could serve 3/4 ppl! Service was great. Our server was very attentive. We were originally sat outside on the patio but the sun would have been on half our group so they were kind enough to move us inside to a large booth. I will come back. Love PF Changs!",92108

In the case of PG Chang's, my expectations must've been super low because my dining experience actually wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. The hubs and I found ourselves at PF Chang's because we received some gift cards that we couldn't regift. We went for an early dinner around 5:30 pm on Saturday and apparently everyone and their mother dines here as well because there was a line and a wait!Food:-Crab wontons: Are these overpriced? Yes, but you can actually taste crab in these unlike at some other places where you just taste cream cheese.-Mongolian beef: This was surprisingly good with tender pieces of beef, and I liked that the green onions weren't limp and overcooked. They still had a nice oniony bite to them!-Walnut shrimp with melon: This is one of my favorite Americanized dishes when done right. I liked that there wasn't a lot of breading on the shrimp and they didn't dump a whole jar of mayo. The shrimp were a good size too, but I didn't care for the melon balls.-Stir fried eggplant: My husband who doesn't like eggplant actually liked this dish. It had a nice vinegar kick to it. -Fried banana rolls with coconut ice cream: The coconut ice cream was good with actual toasted coconut flakes. There was also a good amount of banana pieces for sharing.-Seasonal cobbler with ice cream (small size): This is a great option if you just want your own dessert and it's a good price too ($4). It was a mixed berry cobbler that was on the sweet side in case you're looking for a cobbler with more tartness. Service:-Despite how busy it was, our waitress (Taylor) was great! She was attentive, friendly, and our waters were always refilled. I was also pleasantly surprised by the small touches like providing you with frosty, cold spoons for your dessert and setting up a folding table just to box your food tableside. If you're looking for authentic Chinese food, obviously you'll be disappointed. However, dial your expectations back and you might be pleasantly surprised!",92108

I placed my order for 5:30PM pickup a day in advance and when I arrived at 5:15PM I was told by the staff that it wasn't even being prepared yet. There were about 40 people inside and outside the restaurant standing around in complete confusion regarding their orders as well as about 30 cars lined up for curbside pickup. It took staff about 20 minutes from the time I arrived to make any kind of announcement to everyone waiting. The poor staff had deal with everyone's frustrations while it seemed like there wasn't a manager in sight. Finally a list of names were called for food that was ready and my name still wasn't on it. People that had pickups for 4PM were just leaving at 6PM with their food. It was extremely greedy of this restaurant to allow so many orders to be placed and to not have any kind of system to handle the volume.

We got broccoli beef (the sauce was too salty, the dish was drowned in salty sauce, the broccoli was crunchy, which was a plus!) their new surf and turf pot (not as good as they advertised it. The lobster was actually a tempura lobster, which was bomb! Wasn't really a fan of the steak and potatoes), shrimp and beef fried rice (a favorite of mine, minus the beef.

No big deal it's Friday right...but when we did get called in, the table is in the front, next to the door and hostess stand.  To make matters worse there are several customers waiting for a table and basically breathing on our table, food, etc. My husband and I are both Veterans and after 3 deployments my husband is always aware of where he sits in relationship to the exits..so I explained the situation to the hostess stand and ask to be seated somewhere else. Not only was the answer no but it was more of a sure we can move you but you'll have to go on the wait list again for another hour and half....but get this they had two booths that were empty right next to us waiting to be clean. So as an alternative I say can you ask the customers not to stand in this area? No was the response...one of the hostess was on her personal phone trying to talk to me and a manger was there but not interjecting or helping the situation at all.  Not happy, so rude, and not Veteran centric!

Now at a normal sushi place the edamame might feed two people..well come to find out for a party of two this edamame dish should fill about four grown men!! IT WAS DELIGHTFUL AND DELICIOUS! The hot and sour soup wasfilled with the perfect amount of tofu, chicken, and zing for our taste buds! The entrees we ordered were Lo Mein with Chicken and the Sweet and Sour Chicken.

She was friendly, made great conversation, made sure we had drinks and kept them flowing as well as making sure we had anything else we needed. Now the disappointment! We were forced to eat brown rice! What Asian restaurant runs out of white rice? We got the Mongolian beef dumplings. Although I love cream cheese the recipe according to the menu doesn't state that and my husband who doesn't like it was highly disappointed. When our food came the plates were gross and had old food on them. We decided that we would get 2 family platters. The ""crispy"" honey chicken was not crispy and the Mongolian beef was beef jerky like. I get flank steak is kind of tuff but it shouldn't be over cooked to the point it looks, feels, and taste as if you're eating beef jerky. Not worth $100 for a family of four and won't be coming back again.",92108

Ok maybe just one mistake. He brought us our food, which was pretty good. After I'm almost finished the girlfriend finally tells the guy that I ordered a beer. He then says oops and asks if I got xxxx beer, wrong brand. I corrected him and then said not to worry about it (I was pretty much done eating.) There was nothing really done to correct the several service errors made. He gave us some $10 off $50 purchase coupon that starts in June. Between the two of us we'd never be able to order $50 of food there so the gesture was nice but the coupon is essentially useless.  Overall it's average food with below average service.",92108

When we arrived they seated us pretty quick and we got to ordering right away. We got the Mongolian Beef, Beef á la Sichuan, Chang's Spicy Chicken, Sweet & Sour Chicken, and Chicken Lo Mein.Hands down my favorite was the Beef á la Sichuan. It had an amazing flavor and was nice and juicy. The Mongolian beef wasn't too bad but it was lacking some flavor I was hoping it would have. The Chang's Spicy Chicken was also a bit of a letdown. It didn't have much flavor and wasn't even remotely spicy, at all! The Sweet & Sour Chicken was pretty good but I wish it had more sauce on it to bring out the flavor. The Chicken Lo Mein was actually really good though. We ate that one up completely haha.We also got a few drinks. We had the Cucumber Blueberry Crush and a few of the Moscow Mules. The Cucumber Blueberry Crush was alright. I don't think the flavors quite went as well as I hoped they would. I did really enjoy the Moscow Mule though. Their house made ginger beer is very strong mind you, but really good!There's two big reasons why I gave them 5 stars though. First off our server was insanely good. He was able to bounce around our table and others with ease and had no problem getting stuff to us. He definitely earned the tip he got! Secondly, I worked in the industry and know some places are not so reputable when valuables are left behind. I left my wallet with $80 in it and thought it would be lost forever. To my delight, they had a great system involved for stuff like that when it's lost and it does go to the manager who will ensure and personally deliver the item to you when you come to retrieve it. That in itself has earned my business.Overall, I definitely recommend this place. The staff is great and if you can find the good item on the menu *cough* Beef á la Sichuan *cough*, then you will definitely enjoy your stay.",92108
1322,"7077 Friars Rd San Diego, CA 92108",Dorothy R.,"Irvine, CA",6/5/2016,2,"We go here sometimes for a slightly higher dining experience than our usual haunts and because I love American-Chinese food, but it's hard to come by with a gluten-intolerance. I cannot say that anything has ever really stood out as amazing here, just sort of middle-of-the-road. There is a dish called ""shrimp in lobster sauce"" that tastes exactly like hot dogs, which is pretty disappointing being like $17. I won't get that one again.Last time we went, however, something rather unpleasant happened. My husband had a hard day at work before we went, and decided to spring for a craft brew. He ordered it with our food, and it didn't show during the appetizer round, or when our dinner finally came out. Halfway through dinner, we decided to ask a passing server if she could see what was up, and she said she would check on it. We did not see her again, and never received the beer. Our server had actually left the restaurant and walked around to the back of it to have a smoke break or something (we could see him since we were sitting outside), so we didn't get a chance to ask him again until he brought the check. He asked us how everything went, and I told him we were really disappointed to never get the beer and he said that it was all his fault because he forgot. I was a little peeved because is it just fine to FORGET something someone had ordered and go on your merry way? It wasn't just his failure though, it was a two-part system, with the secondary server, to arrive at this unhappy beer-less state. He took the ordered beer off the check, but that was all. I was a little amazed that there wasn't any attempt at recompense for basically forgetting to do his job and having another person not even do what she promised by ""checking on it"".The experience will definitely give me pause before we decide to put out $50 for dinner. There are plenty of options in our neighborhood at that price point, just tried to have a regular place for date night, instead of searching around. Oh well.",92108

Last night we went to Mission Valley and it was extremely underwhelming. No one in there seemed to give a damn about anything. First, we walked in and 5 parties are waiting and we are told 10-15 minutes which was fine until I looked around and noticed that there were at least 6 tables that were vacant and had not been bussed yet. No urgency whatsoever. We finally got seated and all of the food that we ordered was just not prepared well. Not that it was bad, it just wasn't good. The server had no idea of the product he was serving. Did not know anything about the Sake that we ordered and did not seem very engaged even though we were trying to pump him up to get some better service. We were done for at least 10 minutes and I actually had to ask another server to send ours over to get our check prepared.  (He was in a deep conversation with the hostess) Never saw a manager and really felt like we were in a Denny's rather than a respectable establishment. Do NOT go here. Go up to the one in UTC instead.Adding to this review- Isn't it sad that as I look at all the less than favorable reviews there is not one response from the restaurant. We will NEVER go back to this location. I do not have this same review for other P.F. Chang's locations that we have been to. Only Mission Valley......

Chang's spicy chicken with fried rice, Grilled salmon with fried rice, chopped salad and edamame as well. The kid's meal were some chicken bites with white rice and fruit. Even though out server forgot a few things and we had to remind her, she was great overall. Seemed like the food was coming out on different sides of the kitchen. We ordered 2 drinks as well that were strong and delicious. Try the Coconut Mojito or Starwbwrry Ginger Margarita ! The Food was meh. My fried rice and fish were so bland. The salad was drenched in dressing which made it so sour and salty. The orange ginger garlic edamame were good. Sadly, I would only return for drinks or happy hour.

We ordered the crab wontons, Stir fried eggplants, Pad Thai with Chicken, Chang's fried rice with beef, and Lo Mein with beef. They were all delicious except I was a little disappointed in my Pad Thai. I already knew coming in that we were gonna be served ""Americanized"" asian food but my dish tasted a bit too americanized for me. I wouldn't recommend it if you frequent local Thai restaurants. Sigh. I knew I should've ordered the grilled fish. I would definitely come again. The funny part before we left  was when my husband had the manager flagged down.

We were seated fairly quickly, however the seat was by the door and it was cold outside, and we felt the cold air every time people entered. As for the food, it was very good. The shrimp appetizer I ate was very good, with spicy sriracha sauce (I forget the name of the dish). Then for my main course I had the orange peel chicken which is always good at PF Chang. However, I remember the portion being a bit bigger, so that is my only complaint on the food. Very good service too!",92108

Chang's. Yes, the food is not authentic Chinese food, but it is really tasty. Personally, we enjoy going to this location because we always receive outstanding service from everyone who works there. For example, not long ago, whilst eating, we smelled something unpleasant near our table. We thought someone had vomited near us because the smell was strong. The waiter went around twice trying to locate the odor. In the end, it seemed that it was a dish someone ordered near us that was prepared with a bit too much vinegar. Nevertheless, they apologized to us and gave us a free dessert. We would have been completely dismissed elsewhere. I absolutely recommend this place. Thank you, P.F. Chang's in Mission Valley for caring about your customers.",92108

But considering I'm from Boston, where genuine Chinese food is the best, it's delivered to you even at 2am, and it's made by Chinese food, this will suffice in CA. I've lived out here for almost 4 years and I find it very difficult to get good chinese food without having to go to Convoy Street. We met up with a few friends here for dinner tonight and it was like every other PF changs. I had organic green tea which was one of the best green teas I've had. It was served to me in a cast iron pot and a small tea cup. My husband had a large glass of beer and he said it was good. My husband was starving so I let him have his way on any appetizer he wanted. He went for the crab wontons, which were good with the plum sauce to dip in. But personally, I don't like to order anything I can make myself at home. I always get the Crispy honey shrimp when I come here so I had that with rice while my husband got the chicken. Hubby seems to like it every time and eat straight from my plate. For $14 though, I didn't get much, but it didn't matter, because I didn't finish it anyway.",92108

I realize Olive Garden is not authentic Italian food (actually, it'd be more reasonable to say that I'm pretty sure it's not authentic. Really, how the heck would I know? I'm not Italian..). So, I shouldn't fault anyone who thinks P.F. Chang's is legit Chinese food, let alone anyone who just frequents the place once in a while like I hit up the O. Garden and El Torito on occasion. However, I was actually underwhelmed with P.F. Chang's version of shrimp with candied walnuts. The addition of cold honeydew melon balls to the warm dish was a nice touch, but the walnuts were kind of soggy and didn't taste terribly ""candied."" Dish was mediocre and price was on the high end; I think you'd be better served sticking to any random Cantonese restaurant for this dish.

We were so full that sharing it worked out perfect. Service was excellent.  We had Edgar and he was a busy little beaver....he was friendly, pleasant, and attentive.  He moved around and did everything so fast...and efficient.NOTE:  I did experience bad service here once--2-3 years ago.  We had a big group and for some reason we had a waiter that just had a bad attitude and didn't come around enough to  take care of us.  With a big group you either need to come around more often or have another waiter/waitress at the table.  Anyway, the manager made it up to us.  He said to come back and try them again and gave us $50 gift card....that was very nice and unexpected.There are so many other dishes I want to try here---so, I will definitely come back!",92108

Our waiter was great and prompt, the food was just okay. Chicken was mushy and noddles were bland. After about only an hour of being there in one of their bigger corner booths the manager with glasses kept walking by staring at our party and standing in front of our booth checking our plates. We thought maybe he was checking to see if he could clear some plates but then after walking to the hostess stand and talking with the gals while looking at us he made it clear he was waiting for us to leave. Then he stood in the middle of the back of the restaurant where we could clearly see him and stared at us with his arms crossed shaking his head. At first our party thought it was no big deal since we hadn't been there long and we were paying customers ordering quite a lot of food celebrating a birthday. After him staring at us for 20 mins straight we all got very uncomfortable and decided to leave.

Unfortunately I was so annoyed waiting I didn't listen when he read the order back or notice it was incorrect! Ughhh I'm walking out and a family sitting there said I hope your food is good ours was awful. I told them about how long I waited they said they sat at there table for 20min before they got service. I got home the food was wrong and ice cold so I'm sure it had been sitting there for quite some time. The shrimp dish that I DID'NT order was very spicy, rubbery and inedible.

My husband and I arrived by 5, well ahead of the Friday night crowd. We were immediately seated in a large booth near the hostess stand. Although it was not at all busy, service was slow and we waited about 10 minutes for the server to show up. The hostess actually ended up taking our drink orders, although within a few minutes of that our server - Justin - arrived. He did a great job serving the rest of our meal, though service was slow from the bar (not his fault). A brief summary of our meal: happy hour prices - good; Mai Tai  - eh, mostly juice and ice and not as good as they used to be. Lettuce wraps - good, but what happened to the server mixing the sauce table side to our liking? We got super spicy, prepared sauce - like it or not!  Dumplings - 4 small dumplings - good but wouldn't have been worth the regular price. Good thing they were on happy hour menu. Street noodles - Very good and the highlight of the meal. Surf and turf was just weird - a stir fry? Not really; sort of like they tossed random items in a bowl and served it up. It just didn't come together.  And the side of rice that comes with it - the tiny bowl was maybe just a scant cup, barely enough for two people to split.In sum - disappointed; so-so food not worth the price; slow service.  I can get comparable food from Panda Express or Pick up Styx for a lot less.

This past visit on 6/9/2018 wasn't what we have come to expect from P.F. Chang's. Upon arrival we waited less than 5 minutes for our table. Looking around the restaurant it was pretty much empty, so we were comfortable we would get or meal and leave to catch a flight out of town. After we were seated we noticed the table we sat at had only table settings (minus silverware) for four even though we had a party of five. Not much of a problem, we figured the server/hostess would bring us another setting, but that wasn't the case. The server took our order and made it aware she was taking over for our main server since he was on a break. Before she had arrived we had already decided what our drink, appetizer and dinner order would be to save time. The sever was polite and treated us in a professional manner. Upon leaving our drinks, the server said she would bring sweetener. We waited about 10 min. and no sweetener to be found. We stopped another server to bring us some and he promptly brought us some. Our appetizers arrived, but still not silverware even though we had asked our server for some when the appetizers arrived. We again had to ask someone else for silverware. The appetizers were pretty much  1/2 done by the time the silverware arrived. During this time our main server arrived letting us know that our food should be out shortly and that he would bring us drink refills. At this time we scanned the room to see the restaurant was filling up, but not out of the ordinary busy. The food finally arrived, which was: beef and broccoli, Chang's spicy chicken, signature chicken low mein and white rice. It was okay, nothing out of the ordinary that you would get a any Chinese restaurant. Our sever cleared our appetizer plates and said that he would bring lager plates for our entrees. Again we waited at least 5 min and still no plates. We figured he would come back right away since our food was delivered already and getting cold. I took it upon myself to get plates from a table nearby table to try and enjoy our meal. While eating I notice the server look towards our way and realized by his reaction that he had forgotten to bring the plates and decided to bring them anyway. Still at this time no refills. Upon delivering our plates he said again he would bring our refills in which he did. We ate our food and left for the evening.It was unfortunate we had to experience such poor service. I hope the servers realize that by not receiving gratuity they will be reminded of what type of service their table had received and what the people at their table thought of their service. I wish that this email be shared with the management and staff at P.F. Chang's we visited to improve the service and keep the high quality of service people are used to expecting at P.F.

We asked the server to take them back, and not to replace it, but they still left it on the bill. We also ordered the ginger chicken and firecracker chicken. The firecracker chicken was pretty good, with fresh herbs, but not spicy enough for my taste. The ginger chicken was bland and tasteless. Overall, we were disappointed in our experience. PF Changs seems likes it's a Restaurant of the past and the management is cutting corners to turn a profit.",92108

It took a long time for our waiter to even bring our drinks.  Quite a bit of time before the food came out etc.   I heard multiple waiters apologizing about different things.  If everyone is apologizing, there has to be something majorly wrong with the operation of the business.  The food was passable but not close to great,  and for that reason it gets a  ""Meh.  I've experienced better"".",92108

For years it's been the go-to place for birthdays, bachelorette parties or work meetings/get togethers because it's the perfect place for a large group of people. Their menu is vegetarian-friendly, gluten-free friendly and of course carnivorous-friendly. Lately I've been getting their stir fried eggplant and an appetizer of the seared ahi tuna (see photos). I also love that between the hours of 2-5pm (I believe) they have happy hour where drinks and appetizers are dramatically marked down.

Been to their other locales in Vegas and more and they are so consistent in their quality and flavors. One of the few corporate chains that is worth going to. Thanks to my son I had a $50 gift card from Xmas. I ordered my fave, double pan fried lo mein noodles with beef, shrimp and chicken, with veggies in a delicious brown soy based sauce. The crunch is SO good! You have to order them double pan fried, if you want them a bit crunchy. It doesn't say that on the menu like it used to and I had to send mine back when I realized they weren't crunchy. And of course their famous signature Chicken Lettuce Wraps. I've had them other places, these are still the best. Also tried their fried green beans with a yummy mayo based chipotle-like sauce for dipping. CRACK...it must be in there somewhere...addicting!Best servers in the world, I swear. SO well trained. I had enough leftovers for two more meals! Love how they now have lunch specials too.

We ordered the king pao shrimp honey chicken and noodles. The Kung pao shrimp was basically inedible it was so salty that the ocean called while I was eating to ask for its salt back. The rest was meh at best with 2 tablespoons of grease sitting at the bottom of the honey chicken container I wouldn't exactly call that good food.  Well at least to go service was great. My daughter was really disappointed they only gave us two fortune cookies when we asked for 3 for our 3 dishes for 3 people she really likes the fortune part.

I would have no qualms eating here on the reg'.

Stay away from the egg drop soup :/ it sucks.  Service here has always been really good.  I don't think I have ever had a bad server.  I only come for lunch because the dim lighting at dinner time depresses me and the noise level is beyond annoying.  I prefer sitting outside.,92108

Not very pleasant. It's fine if she would've smiled but no. Oddly forgot to ask us whether we wanted white or brown rice. It's an Asian (Americanized but still) restaurant how can you forget. Every time we asked for something it seemed we were bothering people. I asked for extra bowls for the large soup we ordered and the lady helping our sever threw out an ""ok"" over her shoulder as she walked briskly away. So, ""service"" not their motto. I actually like going to pf changs but I have seen much much better service than this location despite being busy.I'm not gonna review the food. You get Americanized asian food and it's all the same.

1462,"7077 Friars Rd San Diego, CA 92108",Isabella B.,"San Diego, CA",4/29/2012,4,"Also reviewing this for what it is - an ""upscale"" Americanized Chinese food restaurant. I think it would be unfair if I were to compare this to other, more authentic Chinese food places.There's at least two locations I can think of: Fashion Valley and Otay Mall. I prefer the Fashion Valley locations because its more spacious and the decor seems a bit more elegant.Service was very attentive and its a given that at least one person has an eye on your drink because our drinks were immediately replaced with new ones when glasses were empty. Their oolong tea was a tad too sweet.For what it is, the food is surprisingly good. The first time I've ever had a chicken lettuce wrap was here. I love whatever the mixture is marinated with and the crispy noodles. Lettuce is fresh and you can always ask for more if needed. i think I'll have to be careful with the horseradish sauce next time though, a bit too strong if used too much.Egg drop soup was excellent. Not too runny like some other Chinese places.The salted pepper shrimp was just the way I liked it: crispy and not too greasy. Again, be conservative with the sauce they give you, as the horseradish can be a bit too overpowering.Their vegetables were somewhat bland, but still edible.Loved their oolong marinated bass. The fish was soft and the marinade had that savory and slightly sweet mixture, but not too overpowering. This is also my mom's favorite dish, and she came her to satisfy it despite the $25.00 price tag.Their fried rices are average. Dessert was excellent; the banana spring rolls were crunchy and not too sweet. The sauce accompanying the spring rolls was excellent. The presentation was excellent. Berries complemented the bananas.Overall, for the price that you're paying and for what it is, you get what you pay for. It also makes good leftovers for the next day.",92108

Today's visit featured another service issue. Went there for lunch with a friend. We went to the check in up front and I put my name down. NO ONE ELSE was up there or waiting for a table at this point. We were given a buzzer and sat down to wait without being told how long it would take to get a table. More people began coming in at this point and all of them were also given buzzers and told to wait. Overhearing their conversation with the hostess up front, they were not reservations but were walk ins like my friend and I were. We probably waited 15-20 min without being taken to our table. 6 parties that came in AFTER us were taken to their tables. Finally having enough, my fiend inquired why so many parties were being taken ahead of us when we were there first.  We were told that they forgot to put my name down.

I like it because it's an americanized version of Chinese food where you can take your american friends, colleagues, clients and what not. I'm on the fence of disliking it because it's americanized Chinese food.Food: The food here is not bad at all. It's comparable to real Chinese food, which is the reason why I don't mind coming here. I've tried quite a bit of items here. My favorite appetizer is the lettuce wraps. My go-to entréeis beef and broccoli or kung pao chicken.Service: It's an attempt of an ""upscale"" Chinese restaurant, but lacks the fine dining. More of a casual dining restaurant if anything. The service is as expected, nothing spectacular and nothing less than expected.Drinks: Everytime I come here for lunch I usually get iced tea or water, so besides that I don't know. :)Overall: This is not a bad place for Chinese food.

No, there were no mobs of Asians or huge Asian extended family gatherings happening here. Should have taken that as a sign: Asians tend to stay away from here. And I see why. I definitely saw why.Food: - Crispy Korean Chicken Wings ($10.95): Why the heck this has the Korean label on it is beyond me. It doesn't taste Korean except for the slight spicy pepper hint, but it's masked by everything else. We dont eat our wings like this. Not to mention, these six wings are like grossly huge ""wings"" with a few thick chunks of chicken fat between the protein. I dont think wings should ever look like this; it seemed like a hybrid between a drumstick and a wing? I dont know, it's confusing. The sweet and slightly tangy sauce mixed well with the chicken meat. That very slight Asian flare is worth noting, but just noting--not completely amazing nor a bad menu item. Like the flare? It's not too spicy but you will notice the slight kick. - PF Chang's Fried Rice ($8.50?): Basic and acceptable fried rice. We asked for pork and it went well with the dish. The soy sauce and other sauces mixed in had a presence to them on the rice and vegetable base. If you have this and add on other entrees on the side, it tastes great...?  - Chang's Spicy Chicken ($13.95): This dish kept an arm's distance away from the ""spicy"" title that it was given. Instead the sweet and spicy chili sauce was subtle but present. The chunks of white meat were surprisingly juicy and not dry like typical white meat. Overall the menu item is kind of boring because there isn't much of a dynamic that keeps me entertained. It's a safe dish, but not something worth going crazy over.   - Shrimp with Lobster Sauce ($13.95): The garlic white wine sauce kept a really subtle hint of oriental flavors that you would expect from this kind of entree. The shallow pool of sauce mixed in with egg, scallions, mushrooms, and Chinese black beans had a smooth texture that went fairly well over rice. But what was most difficult was that even though it had much potential, it felt premature with the rich flavors you would want in this kind of shrimp dish. Each ingredient tasted like it was masked by a layer of blandness that was hard to reconcile. The shrimp didn't help, even though it absorbed the sauce well, it didn't bring out any other flavors. Lets just say, my taste buds were a little bored. Sounds much like a consensus with the other menu itemsPros: - Clean and modern interior, great for a generic chain higher-class restaurant. Reminds me of the interior of The Cheesecake Factory across the parking lot. The dark mood inside keeps the ambiance consistent. - They use high quality ingredients. To my knowledge. - Flexible and kind waiters. Thanks!Cons: - Way overpriced for underwhelming food. - Chinese bistro?...made commercialized and Americanized. Please.  - Small portions. You'll fill up on rice more than the entree.I dont like reviewing chain restaurants but I guess I should since we paid too much, so why not add it to my Yelp list. I came in knowing I will have an underwhelming experience, and it was confirmed: underwhelming. Please, such a rich cultural food cuisine should not be judged by your experience here. But if ALL else fails, and your stereotypical Chinese take-out place is just too far from reach, I guessssss this wouldn't be absolutely terrible....",92108

Our server, Matt, was extremely friendly and helpful in deciding what to order. My boyfriend was trying to remember a drink he'd had last time we went to a PF Chang's because it wasn't on the menu, and our server figured it out and brought it over quickly, along with my yummy Asian Pear Mojito. I appreciated his candidness in offering his opinions on what I was deciding between. As per his advice, I got the rarely-ordered (supposedly) chicken in black bean sauce, which sounds like it should be at a Mexican restaurant. It was very good! The pork chow mein was also tasty, as were the famous lettuce wraps we started with. We were too stuffed for dessert.

Chang's here we come!Now it was the first time for all of us and we only waited ten minutes for a table for five, which was great, and we had a great waitress, helped explain things and was patience with my slow family.Food time. We all decided to share (to some extent) our food, since P.F. Chang's serves their food family style. My father ordered Almond Chicken, my brother ordered some spicy noodle thing, my other little brother ordered the appetizer ribs, and my boyfriend and I ordered the dinner for two (which came with two -small- appetizers, two entrees, and dessert) which was two hot and sour soups, Spicy Kung Pao Shrimp, Mongolian Beef, and a Key Lime bar. We also ordered Calamari as our appetizer and my littlest brother ordered red velvet cake (which he only ate the cake part...smh).Well the food came on small plates and at first I was surprised to see the size for a $13-15, still am, but since we all shared a little bit we were able to be filled and have a bit extra to take home.I was very satisfied with my dining experience, our waitress refilled our drinks promptly, asked how we were, and the food was great. I especially was surprised with the dessert; it was tangy, even a little bit bitter in some bites (like zest). I really enjoyed it, since I love having desserts that are refreshing and not overkilling me with sugar.Hopefully I will have another chance to go again (but just me and my boyfriend haha).",92108

By far the worst service I have received from this establishment. The service is typically sub par but on this occasion it was horrible. Our server Raul was not attentive at all. He did not offer refills on water or the other drinks we were drinking. My food came out incorrect and inedible and he didn't check back with us until we were half way through the meal and he didn't seem at all concerned that my food was sitting at the end of the table untouched. He was in the server side station talking with other servers multiple times when he could have used that time to check on us and he would have realized that I was not satisfied with my meal and I wanted a replacement. I sat at the table and only ate rice because he never came to check on us. My friend sat there with ice in his cup for 3/4 of the meal with no refill on his drink. When I asked him to take my meal away and have it taken off the check, he immediately brought my check back to me as if I was done with my meal which was completely rude and not service forward. We left the restaurant feeling unappreciated and the over all service in that establishment was beyond terrible. As a server, there is a level of customer service one should offer and this server had no care in the world. I would not go back to this place anytime soon. Completely horrible!!",92108

Food was good, by the way so another 1/2 of a star makes it one star.  Can't say I'll be back to this PF Chang's except it's located near a movie theater I go to sometimes.  Been to this P.F.

My fiancé received an email from PF Changs for a 'buy one entree, get one entree free' promotion, valid until 2/28. We told our server at the beginning, when we ordered our drinks and appetizers that we had this email promotion and she took down his full name, email, and phone number, and we showed her the email with the barcode, but left us with a 'we shall see if this goes through attitude'. Hmm a little strange but we went with it and ordered two entrees plus fried rice and dessert. I'd like to point out that when we ordered the fried rice she suggested that we get the full vegetable fried rice instead of the side. As it's more for your money. When it was time to pay she brought the manger over, young guy with a shaved head, to recopy the information for the buy one get one free entree, saying the computer recognizes it as an appetizer. Then, she came back saying that the computer finally picked it up, but she can't pick what it takes out and it picked the $9 fried rice instead of the $17 entree.  She said that she 'fought for us' but there's nothing she can do, it's up to her manager and that she could bring him over. I don't blame her. Honestly, she looked a little shaken that she had to be telling us this, she was really nice. I blame her manager. I worked at another PF Changs for 4 years, I know that they can comp items, I know that they can take things off and then add them back. He came back over with this 'what's the problem attitude' and basically said his hands were tied. Am I gonna argue with him over $8? No, but I'm just not gonna come back.",92108

They were featuring a new menu of small plates with summer fresh offerings.  I chose the 3 mini lobster tacos. It was a great concept: the taco shell was constructed from jicama & held up with a great crunch. The lobster pieces were tempura fried but so miniscule as to impart no flavor.  It came with slices of red Chile for just the right kick, fresh cilantro but the shredded cabbage was under the metal taco holder so I had to lift the thing up to put some in my taco.  So great concept but execution & lack of lobster failed.  Hope they work on these shortcomings bc it had the promise of a great, light dish. My sweetheart got the tuna & avocado tartare. How do I say this?  It was weird! The presentation was awful.  It basically looked like my Nonna's meatballs before cooking.

Our food came out as Mongollion Beef with tons of scallions, 3 pieces of brocolli and no extra spicy sauce added. I flagged down a hostess walking by & asked for a manager to be sent to our table. (which no one ever came to talk to us) The hostess told our server we were disappointed and while huffing & puffing and a snarl on her face, she came to our table & she said ""I didn't hear you say no scallions!

With a 3-6$ price range, I thought it was fairly reasonable.  Drink specials included 3$ drafts, 5$ wines by the glass, and 6$ cocktails. My two dining guests were not exactly big Asian food diners, so I figured a chain like PF Changs would fit the bill :) Hence, I kept the selections rather basic & simple.Here's what we ordered:From the HH list:1. Crab wontons (5$) - your standard fare of fried Wonton with cream cheese crab filling.  Tasty but nothing spectacular.2. Egg Rolls (3$) - 2 large fried eggrolls filled with a generous portion of seasoned cabbage & other veggies. Just your standard Panda Express egg roll, nothing special here, alright people let's move on...3. Chang's Spare Ribs (6$) - 6 pieces of succulent spare ribs covered in a sweet & tangy sauce. Yum!4. Dynamite shrimp (6$) - battered popcorn style shrimp covered in a spicy chipotle sauce.  Was this Asian!?' I dunno, the Chipotle flavor threw me off a bit, not my favorite dish.  However, my coworker had no problem devouring the entire dish herself! At least somebody liked it.Not from the HH Menu1. Garlic noodles - served with julienned cucumbers. This tangy and mildly spicy dish always makes my taste buds pop! One of my personal favorites...Not exactly the Beez-Neez, but definitely an honorable mention!2. Wonton Soup - Served family style with large shrimp wontons, tender greens, mushrooms, and water chestnuts. The broth was simple & light, yet warm and quite comforting. To sum things up, there were some hits & some misses with the dishes I ordered tonight. With that said, my dining guests were quite happy with what they sampled.They both ordered cocktails as well, and found the cocktails to be both tasty and potent!  Much better than the HH (or lack of one!)at neighboring Cheesecake Factory.  Although the menu was a bit pedestrian for my taste, I realized there was something on the table for each of us to enjoy, individually.  Overall, I was satisfied, except with the bad heartburn I got afterwards... :(This meal was definitely A-OK in my book!Happy Eats!",92108

I really appreciate it. To drink we ordered a couple hot sakes, I also ordered the PX-6, my boy ordered a standard beer. PX-6 was just gross. I had had it before but not sure what the bartender did this time but it was almost undrinkable... Hot sake is hot sake... it's hard to eff that one up. The one saving grace of this experience was the crab wontons. We all thoroughly enjoyed them. Couple other things we ordered were egg rolls (which were over cooked) , and the northern style spare ribs which Jay enjoyed but I was already so put off by everything that I had no desire to try.

Considering that I haven't been to PFs in a while, thought this was a very good marketing ploy and incentive to return. The 4 course meal deal includes: 2 cups of soup, 1 starter, 2 entrees and 2 mini desserts. The review is as follows: 1 of each soup - Hot and Sour and Egg Drop - I had the Egg Drop, which I thought was fairly bland in taste. Crab Wontons as the starter - Can't go wrong with crab wontons. Honey Shrimp and Orange Peel Beef - I prefer the honey shrimp over the orange peel beef. The honey shrimp had just enough flavor/sweetness and not overbearing. Additionally, the shrimp had a very light batter which I truly enjoyed. Conversely, the beef dish looked dry and unappetizing (in my opinion). I had a few pieces and I was done. Smores and Lemon mini desserts - The smores mini dessert was very sweet and definitely satisfied my typically after dinner chocolate craving. The lemon mini was oh-so tart! Not my kind of dessert!!! I enjoyed the ambiance, and the service was great. Our server's name was Blake, and he was very friendly, attentive and even offered if we would like extra brown and white rice with our leftovers.

Just the mention of this place infuriates me, and gives me shivers down my spine, eyes rolling back in my head when someone says ""I Love PF Chang's"" What does the PF stand for anyway? Poor Food? Phony Food?I understand the whole Americanized Chinese food thing trust me, but this is just an Abomination!  Kung Pao chicken, Beef Broccoli, sweet sour pork, egg foo young, and Lemon Chicken.  Yes, they are all Americanized dishes!  PF Chang's is like Americanized twice over.  First there was Chinese food, then they changed the dishes to accommodate American taste.  Then for some reason PF Chang's took those dishes and reworked them again!  The result, a bad Frankenstein version of Chinese food. I just don't get it, everything that is supposed to be beef or pork is ground chicken.  No wonder the anorexic, health conscience, cougars love the Lettuce Wraps so much.  And lemon scallops? Really? as if Lemon chicken wasn't bad enough, you have to ruin, something else that cost even more?  Why not kung pao lobster or fillet mignon/broccoli?  I can't see how people actually like the food.  Really, lets be honest, it's no better than Panda Express in a fancy restaurant!  My only conclusion is that people are fooled into thinking it's good because the atmosphere and high prices.  Probably the same people who wear $300 jeans, because it's so much better!  Same F' ing thing.  Except it's 3 times as much and eat with your pinky out!",92108

Okay, fine maybe they just finished while I was parking- no one knows. I live 5 minutes away, when I got home it was luke warm, had to use the microwave. The rice was crap, tasted lie the 5 minute rice. The serving sizes were small! 3 small pieces of chicken breast and a few pieced of broccoli. It wasn't even enough for my husband let alone enough to share. The favoring was okay, nothing special.

Not too fond of the unremarkable chicken dish; I can't even remember which one we ordered. Got the prie fix menu for 2 and it wasn't a bad deal - comes with 2 soups, one app, 2 entrees, and a small dessert (that you can upgrade). I was hesitant to try the hot & sour soup since our waiter warned me it was hit or miss with most people due to the sourness. He was really nice and offered to replace it to an egg drop soup if I didn't like it, but I ended up loving it! For anyone wondering, the dessert dumplings come in a pair and you can only get one flavor (there's either choco/raspberry or vanilla). You can upgrade this if you wanna try both flavors (which I did of course). Nice little way to end your meal without feeling too guilty. Overall great service. Would return.",92108

Chang's is not traditional, nor is it visionary.That said, what you get at P.F.

(the rice is brown rice and the crab real lump crab meat.)At lunch, They have dim sum portions of some of their apps like steamed dumplings. 3 for 3.95, 6 for 7.00.And of course they are famous for starting the lettuce wrap craze.We have never had bad food or service at any of the P.F.

We told her either table or booth would work. The only tables they had available were right by the door in a high traffic area, which they offered but we declined because that would not be enjoyable for anyone to sit there. She said she put us down for first available which would ""reduce our wait time."" There should not be a wait time if someone has a res, which is the whole point of making a res in the first place.

1574,"7077 Friars Rd San Diego, CA 92108",Negabadomi M.,"San Diego, CA",1/9/2016,4,I came here right after the Christmas holiday with the family for a birthday dinner. We made a reservation for 6:15 pm. We were seated approximately at 6:45 pm. This place was chaotic for a Tuesday night. The service was okay. Our server was way too busy to be attentive. I can't really blame him but it was unfortunate since we were there to celebrate my grandma's 75th birthday. The food was actually great. The only complaint we had was the temperature of the tea. It came out twice and was not hot. Probably because it was just too busy in there to get it right. My grandma sent it back twice. I will definitely be back. I love this place. Next time I will go to Costco first and buy gift cards which gives you a 20% discount.,92108
1575,"7077 Friars Rd San Diego, CA 92108",Chef J.,"San Diego, CA",1/20/2019,1,"Feedback on bad experience. We sat down at the Fashion Valley store at 5:15PM. Our waitress was Rachel. I ordered the Syngapore Black Pepper chicken, the veggie egg rolls, and a cup of wonton soup. I asked Rachel to please make sure they don't overcook the chicken and asked her to tell them verbally. Problem 1. We asked for straws after she brought our drinks. She said she only brings straws by special request. We asked for 2. They came after 12 Min. Problem 2. The wontons were not cooked fully and were hard, and the soup was barely warm. Problem 3. The egg rolls had soggy overcooked vegetables and too many mushrooms, but was not real bad. Problem 4. The chicken was way overcooked and dry beyond belief, and there was not black pepper or sauce at all. It came on a metal tin. This continues to cook it but it should be served on a plate with pepper sauce. The ticket reads syngapore chicken and no mention of black pepper, so the Chef forgets. No flavor at all---very bland, dry and tough. I had to dump a boat load of soy sauce which made me feel sick later. Rachel did not come to ask if everything was ok, until we were 2/3 the way finished. It was the worst dish I ever ate. Panda Express is way better, but this was $18!!! It should have been $14. Problem 5. No salt and pepper shakers available. Problem 6. My wife had the K. Noodles and the meat was also overcooked. Conclusion: We are not coming back! Your food is very pricey for what you get, and the Chef is an amateur.  Please correct your bad service and cooking, and add more waiters. I felt this was a waste of money and for sure, not worth $50. We had 2 birthdays, and the complimentary caramel/butterscotch bread pudding was the only good thing on the table. This place is poorly Managed. My second time here and second time in a row, it was awful. Please bring back the lemon pepper chicken--it is quite good.",92108

I went to the one at Fashion Valley the other day because I was in between decisions in where to eat and I'm still not too familiar with the area. Long story short, the dining experience was amazing. We had a server that was outgoing and cheerful, which made our ordering experience enjoyable. And the Mongolian Beef is to die for. I don't know what they cook it in but it is one of those dishes that you can't stop eating once you start. I ended up coming back here a few days later and again, we had incredible service. Our waitress was very helpful and a sweetheart, refilling our drinks at the right time and always checking in on us, referring to us as ""dear"", which I thought was a nice touch. And finally, the fortune cookies have some good fortunes in them, but some cookies were stale, but what do you expect from a free cookie, lol. I'm definitely coming back again",92108

To start with, we got there before the ""crowd"", not that that made any difference. The host tried to seat us at a small table, off to the side, in the back. Considering there were plenty of empty booths as well as large tables, I was a bit insulated. After asking for a bigger table, we were seated, still in the rear of the restaurant  (really!?!).Still no crowd, but took forever for someone to come by and greet us. We ordered immediately, since we had plenty of time to peruse the menu (I could almost recite it verbatim by this point).The drinks were amazing, if not overpriced. A coconut lemon sour goes down well, but at $9 a pop, you almost choke when you see the bill.We ordered the combo special, which consists of an appetizer, two cups of soup, two entrees and a shared dessert. Not a bad deal for $39.95.The lettuce wraps are to die for, get them as the appetizer and you cannot go wrong.My hot and sour soup was also very tasty. The entrees were delish. We had the honey shrimp and the beef al a Sichuan.The real problem was the service.It took forever to get to order, for the food to be brought out, and for anything to be refilled (never did see more potsticker sauce, as Ryan called it).When we requested the blinds to be drawn, because the light from the setting sun was blinding us, Ryan said he couldn't shut them, but would ask the manager. Really!?!. The worst part is, the party in front of us also asked for the blinds to be drawn, with the same excuse coming from Ryan.The problem was finally resolved by the manager, but our dining experience was way past ruined by then.When it finally came time to pay, we wanted to use several gift cards we had been given. I couldn't believe it but PF Changs gift card policy is that if they didn't issue it (IE. say a Visa gift card I had), they will not use the balance on the card! That is right, they will only charge up to 80% of the value of the card. Unbelievable I know, right!?!In conclusion, I would say, until certain service issues and policies are changed, I am taking my dining dollars to the competition. This is because I expect good service, good food, and a pleasant atmosphere in which to dine.Shame on you PF Changs, one out of three is definitely not acceptable.",92108

D.,"San Diego, CA",8/18/2013,5,"Let me start off by saying that I eat here all the time...and that I hardly ever give five-star ratings on Yelp.That said, the reason I think this PF Chang location deserves five stars is for the following reasons:1)  They've always had a wide variety of gluten-free dishes, and they keep expanding their GF menu.2) They are one of the very few restaurant chains that REALLY gets the gluten issue in terms of preparation, cross-contamination, etc.3) They have an excellent bar.4) The food is always hot, always satisfying, always interesting, always delicious.5) This particular location is probably two or three times better at everything they do than the other PF Chang locations in San Diego.As for favorites...everything is good, but I enjoy the Lettuce Wraps, Street Noodles, Mongolian Beef, Garlic Spinach (side), and of course the Spicy Chicken.  For dessert, they only offer one GF option, but it happens to be the best dessert on the menu:  the flourless chocolate cake dome.  Yum.Now the caveats:  a) Yes, parking is a pain.  It's a mall parking lot, and San Diegans tend to be spacially challenged in their driving and parking habits, but with a little patience, you will eventually find a spot.b) Yes, you will have to wait for a table...sometimes over twenty minutes.c) Yes, the food is NOT ""traditional Chinese"" food, and it also isn't subtle; it can be very sweet, very salty, very spicy, etc.But, with those variables in mind, I can count on PF Chang's to deliver an excellent overall dining experience at a reasonable price, which is why I almost always take my guest visitors to San Diego here on their first night in town.",92108

Every time I eat here it seems as though there is some type of issue from a lack of attention by my server to the time one of the bartenders decided to change the tip on the credit card receipt (which could have been an innocent mistake but needs to be corrected none the less). I know things will happen in a large establishment such as this, but management has also proven unhelpful in these instances. I suggest they explore further training on service recovery as not to exasperate an already unpleasant situation. Given my less than stellar track record with this location, I decided to order take out today. Again the food was great, but I did not escape from the experience without issues. I ordered for a number of coworkers and when I got back to the office we noticed that someone who ordered lettuce wraps received the filling and no lettuce. I mean that's kind of a big component of lettuce wraps. We also did not receive the fortune cookies we requested, which alone would not have been a big deal. I'm sure with a big name like PF Chang's they're not overly concerned about losing customers, but I feel that it's only a matter of time before this happens if they keep with the current trend. Personally, I've never encountered the same issues at other locations. Perhaps they can slow down a bit and focus on taking better care of their customers.",92108

Just isn't really something I crave. But my family LOVES it here. For starters, we got the chicken wraps and the eggplant stir fry. These were the highlight. Try a lettus cup with chicken and the crispy noodles on the bottom with some eggplant and just a little bit of soy sauce. This was delicious!! The chicken is very flavorful and the crispy noodles add a nice texture. The eggplant has such an amazing flavor to it. It's covered in a delicious sauce that's sweet and a little spicy. The eggplant stir fry is definitely one of my new favorite dishes. So for our entrees, we got shrimp lo mien. Instead of the regular shrimp, I asked for them to be dipped into potato starch and have them lightly fried. End result? Super good!! Crispy and flavorful shrimp. Here's what I didn't like, the noodles. I'm not a fan of them and some people are, so it's just my own opinion. However, the vegetables and the raw onion mixed with the noodles were very yummy. It's a birthday, so we had to have dessert. Tiramisu and fried banana! Both were very good. The fried banana with ice cream will give you a reason to quit your diet. It's wrapped fried banana, with a dash of cinnamon and coconut and pineapple ice cream. Eat both of those together and you'll find yourself wanting a lot more! So the food was very good. The service was great as well. Everything was brought out in a timely manner and our drinks were full the whole time. So I'll be coming back! :)",92108

Her response was she ""hadn't ate and could not think straight"". Maybe the cast she had on her wrist was to tight.I ordered a bottle of champagne $71.00 and our server was new and did not know how to open the bottle so the bartender came to our table to open it, it was a learning for him.that being said no champagne bucket was brought to our table, so it sat on the table getting room temperature. I tried in vain many times to get his attention but to no avail.I ordered appetizers. Two cups of egg drop soup and an order of 2 spring rolls. It comes with a sauce I don't care for so I asked for a plum sauce, but when the spring rolls were brought to the table no sauce as I had requested, and once again no waiter.  Let me state that at 4:30 only 4 tables were with customers so it was not like he was overwhelmed.Now for our entrees. We ordered the honey shrimp, shrimp and lobster sauce, and there new lobster fried rice. The old P F Chang restaurant used to make a sauce at your table from 3 different sauces, made to your likings. Well we asked our waiter to do this, he brought 3 sauces to our table and walked away. There wasn't even a dish brought to our table if we even wanted to make a sauce to our liking.The prices for the food have really gone up yet the taste is no where as good as it used to be.The service is lacking, the atmosphere is less then stellar.

I'm not gonna complain about listening to Fergie ""Big Girls Don't Cry"" while slurping on some Hot & Sour soup. Although my ears may be hurting, I'm not gonna cry about spending $5 for getting a huge bowl of Hot & Sour soup for that serves 4 people. I guess that's a pretty good deal. But, this place is group-friendly and serves large portions.My favorite is the Singapore Street Noodles. I wish they named it something else because I always feel to dirty everytime I order it.  My mother ordered the Ma Po Tofu and the curry sauce was delicious, I wish the tofu's consistency was firmer, but whatever. My father got the Sweet and Sour Chicken and it was so ""Panda Express"" tasting; Basically, it tasted exactly how I anticipated to be. My sister ordered the Beef a la Sichuan and it was scrumptious.

The food is ridiculous and overpriced. It's so-so at best. The service is always pretty lousy when it's busy. If you want authentic Chinese food, go to San Francisco or Los Angeles. There are definitely some great places in San Diego too, but seriously--PF Chang's is not any sort of real Chinese food. It's over Americanized and should be considered American food. The service is as piss poor as a French restaurant, and the wait for this place is appalling.Go here if you want to impress people with how awesomely worldly you are. The lettuce wraps are pretty much the only good thing here. Anything else you can get elsewhere for cheaper, not to mention tastier.",92108

1676,"7077 Friars Rd San Diego, CA 92108",Chris M.,"San Diego, CA",11/22/2009,4,"I have finally finally figured it out! A ""foodie"" is really the culinary version of a ""hipster."" Like a hipster, the foodie wont come right out and state it, although, unlike the hipster, a foodie is more transparently proud of it and occasionally boasts of their status. Want to be a foodie, or not sure how to distinguish one? Here are the typical foodie positions: 1. Chain restaurants are the equivalent of owning a PC in the hipster world. The are beyond uncool. They SUCK. They always use second rate ingredients that are definitely not fresh. You must hate them or risk looking like a culinary dolt. Basically, they insult you. 2. Ethnic chain restaurants are definitely not ""authentic."" These are the most insulting of all restaurants. In all likelihood, you have never been to the country much less lived there to based this on, but you know it anyway. These are the most deplorable of all places to eat. You teeter between resentment and disdain on your feelings. 3. Foodies are sophisticated. You ""love"" wine and ""always"" drink red; Pinor Noir to be specific. ""Real"" wine connoisseurs drink red. Whites are enjoyed with a seafood only and white zins are a borderline joke. This preference is based upon what you've learned post the explosion of wine bars circa 2006. Not coincidental that Sideways was released the year prior. 4. You have moved here from some other state and the state is known for the cuisine you are commenting on. Nothing is better than were you were from because (I guess) somehow that makes you an expert. Regardless of the reputation of the restaurant you are commenting on, where you are from is still better. Period. 5. You are a self-anointed ""sushi snob."" You have your own rating scale: ""super fresh"" to ""not fresh."" You arent fooled when it comes to freshness. Predictably, how east it is from the ocean and the number of Japanese looking/speaking people there are is directly proportional to how fresh the fish is. You wouldnt be caught dead eating sashimi unless it is ""super fresh,"" and its at an ""authentic"" sushi bar. Ironically, there are few types (if any) of sashimi that you like and you mostly order rolls. You have never lived in or been to Japan but you have been eating it ""like forever."" You never disclose how you can tell the difference between ""super fresh, really fresh, fresh and not fresh."" First of all, China isnt unified and is regionally very diverse. I am no expert, but Ive eaten authentic Chinese food in Hong Kong. What its like in mainland China and the other commonwealth (Taiwan) I have no idea. I know there is at least three types -szechwan, cantonese and shandong. Im under the impression there are more. Ive heard as many as eight. A ""foodie"" isnt concerned about that. PF Chang's is a Chinese chain restaurant so youll see reviews slamming them for not being ""authentic."" Note they arent using the term ""traditional."" Not ""authentic."" That sounds more authoritarian and thus, sophisticated. A ""foodie"" is definitely sophisticated. Ive been to most Chinese places in San Diego proper. Mandrin House, Gen Lai Sen, Hong Kong... these are all Americanized. Which is good. Mainland China's per capita income is likely just better than sub-saharan Africa, which means that there arent any spare parts on the animal you are going to eat. Most Americans that havent lived in China would have a lot of adjusting to do to find it appealing. The cold hard truth about American influence on ethnic dishes lies with the Filipinos. Why? They are keeping it real. Its the only ethic group that hasnt Americanized its food. Ever been to a Filipino restaurant? Sinagong still has fish heads in it. They cater to traditional recipes. Jollibee doesnt count. Anyway, PF Changs is quality Chinese food. I like it and Im not ashamed to say so. Arguably higher quality than the places I mentioned above.",92108

A friend of mine had coupons for free lettuce wraps so we ate here yesterday. Hey, the economy sucks so don't laugh. I will take free food any day of the week. The last time I ate here was when this chain of restaurants was fairly new, and I remember sort of liking it. But after having lived in Europe for over 10 years, and after traveling the world and experiencing a wealth of flavors in world cuisine, my taste buds have surely evolved, as I found their food to be very bland and dull. I am a HUGE fan of hot and sour soup, but theirs was god awful. I don't know how to describe the taste...uhm...bland failure with a hint of dirty dishwater I guess would do it justice. I had to add lots of chili oil and chili sauce just to give it flavor. It also had small chunks of broccoli in it (wtf). The lettuce wraps were so-so. It was ground up chicken meat that you scoop into iceberg lettuce leaves. The chicken was dry, but well seasoned. Again, the sauce on the table and the spicy mustard helped it go down.They have a happy hour menu that is average at best. I tried the lemongrass chicken dumplings and they were pretty tasty, but they also tasted like they had been defrosted. If you expect to have civilized conversation over your food then don't bother eating indoors. It was noisy as hell and everyone's voices echoed and revibrated off the walls. We decided to go eat on the patio instead, which offered a better atmosphere for chatting. Seriously, why do Americans feel the need to shout when they eat? Even the Greeks are more quiet inside the restaurants of Athens. Of course PF Chang's has no control over how loud and obnoxious their patrons get; this is just a general statement. So when we were outside a waiter kept fiddling with the propane and the outdoor heating lamp. He kept banging the side of the propane tank next to our table as he was trying to hook it up and this went on for several minutes. He didn't even seem to take notice it was loud and annoying.So, for roughly 4 average lettuce wraps, 3 average/good dumplings and a huge BAD bowl of hot and sour soup that could feed 4 people, our bill was $12. I mean, the price isn't bad, but for $12 I could have gone to the grocery store and made better fake Chinese food that would taste better without having to tip or deal with pointless racket. Hell, I could have had some pho, or even a Subway sandwich would have been better. If you are a typical American who thinks that good Chinese food consists of Panda Express, and if you enjoy shouting while stuffing orange chicken in your mouth, then you will simply adore this place and in that case I say knock yourself out and go nuts here.

He brought out everything in a basket and was placed all the items in a plastic bag in front of our eyes. This was great because we were able to make sure our order was correct. When we got home to eat it, it was a meal from heaven. The orange chicken was zesty and tender. The kung pao chicken was amazing! The rice was warm and sticky. The lettuce wraps were the best I've ever had. They come with lettuce, meat and then crunchies (idk the official name, but they're those white crunchy things). And the cheesecake was incredible. It came with sliced strawberries and raspberries with a special raspberry sauce to pour on top. I can't remember the last time I ate so much and felt great afterwards. The entire meal was $45, and I think it was well worth it. I definitely want to visit again.",92108

I truly had a great experience here, even at the highest peak of a Friday lunch rush. First of all, they have an entire page dedicated to a gluten free menu on the back of the regular menus. AWESOME. They had a huge selection of dishes that use tamari in all the sauces instead of soy sauce. I had my first order of combo fried rice since going gluten free over a year ago, and it was heaven. Plump shrimp, seasoned beef and pork that were tasty and flavorful unlike most bland GF options at asian restaurants. There is even a flourless chocolate cake for dessert.Our waitress was great, asked us right as she came to our table if we were on a lunch break and promised to keep it snappy. And she did! We had our dishes out within 10 minutes, and happily sipped on a very nicely priced bottle of pinot gris while we waited. All in all I thought it was great. I minus one star for not getting seating outside because all the 4-some tables were occupied by singles who could have easily been seated at the 2-some tables. And also not getting a booth as a second option. Seriously, why aren't all tables booths?Which makes me think of an un-review-related question: Does anyone really prefer sitting at a table over a booth when they go out to eat?

So we decided on PF Changs. He actually used to be a server for one when he lived in Jersey, so his standards are already pretty high.Our servers name was Aidan. And he was a delight. He came to the table promptly, was suggestive but not intrusive. He checked back within a couple bites of our food and then within a few more minutes. Basically we were never looking around for him, and he was never annoying us with his presence. Also, he knew what he was talking about and never looked rattled. He was on top of his game and very professional.One of the best things was he would refill a drink around the time our glass was 3/4 empty. No questions asked. And something that drives me CRAZY when people don't do it, he actually changed out the bev nap every time he brought a new drink. So ourtable didn't get all wet and messy.

All the chicken entrees taste exactly the same regardless of the name or sauce. If I had to pick, it would be the crispy honey chicken. Don't expect the crispy batter on the outside of the orange chicken like you normally see at other Chinese restaurants. The double pan-fried noodles are always overly drenched with sauce so be warned. For dessert, their banana egg rolls are money. If you want to feel like you are going out of your realm and trying authentic Asian cuisine then stay away from this place. I would say it is comparable to Pei-Wei (same company I believe) or Pick Up Stix but for double the cost.  Nothing magical but consistent.",92108

We ordered a ton of food as it was Happy Hour prices and we were starving.  The waiter handled our machine gun style ordering with grace.  We loved the tuna tataki, crispy green beans (2 orders), shanghai street dumplings, egg rolls, Korean tacos, crab wantons, and more.  The baby had an order of edamame and fried rice (which I finished as it was fantastic).  I live for those crispy green beans with their light tempura and spicy aioli sauce. Gary has always loved the lemon scallops and was bummed not to find them on the menu.  However, the waitress had them specially made from him and he was so pleased.  My son-in-law ordered the orange peel chicken, which he devoured, and my daughter had the sesame chicken.  I had the Norwegian salmon steamed with ginger that was served over stir-fried shiitake mushrooms, bok choy, tomatoes, and asparagus.  All the dishes were perfect!An impeccable meal with flawless service!",92108

This was the first place I ever ordered them back in the day, and they still do it better than anyone else! Also tried the Mongolian Beef, because everyone on Yelp said is was the best, and sure enuff it was! Super tender beef.I love that they bring you ""Good"" chopsticks. Not the ones that you pull apart and they aren't made of balsa wood either! They are presented to you in a nice box by the hostess! I still used a fork, but I felt legit.

So I did not know what to expect. When we got there we were greeted by the friendly hostesses that took our name and told us that it was going to be about a 10 min. wait. After about 5 min. our pager when off and we were seated. We were greeted right away by our server Joshua. Who did an excellent job serving us. We decided on having the four course meal for two deal that they offer. All of which was all really good. After this experience I have a feeling that this may be the first of many trips to P.F.

The lettuce wraps are always good.  The egg plant was delicious but everything else pretty much tasted all the same and very salty. The broccoli beef had hardly any broccoli- it was more like stir fried beef. The chicken fried rice was bland and dry. They are over priced for what you get. The quality isn't what it used to be.

They pack so many people into this place that it's hard to even think straight.Food is average. For the prices you would think that they were serving the very best recipes for Asian food but that just isn't the case.But really, the 1 star is for the fact that they timed our courses horribly. We were hardly 1/2 way through our soups and the appetizers were there. STILL eating our soup and the main course showed up. There was just the two of us eating and our table was FULL of dishes! I think they get away with this because people these days just don't know how proper service is delivered in a restaurant. But even so, isn't it just common sense to wait until someone is done eating a course before bringing out the next?On top of that my husband's main course was very cold. Not just tepid but cold.

Otherwise I probably would never go here. PF Changs in general is really overpriced for mediocre food. However, we got $100 in gift cards for there on Christmas and decided to use them last night. When we were sat, our server was also helping a very large party at the table next to us so I immediately figured he was going to be occupied by them a lot, which wasn't an issue. He came over and apologized for being so busy with them. He was very nice and hospitable throughout our time there and when he couldn't help us, he always had someone else come ask us how we were doing. Overall, the service was great. The food tasted the same as usual. Nothing special. We tipped him 20% for his attitude and for obviously putting in an effort to do his best. Here's where it went downhill ... When we got home, I realized that we had been charged for dessert but never got it. We ordered the Chang's for two which comes with a dessert and we had ordered what we wanted and it never came. Yes, we should have noticed while we were there but he brought out the check and we paid and left without thinking about it. We were bummed but oh well. THEN, I went to eat our leftovers today and was shocked. We had A TON of food leftover when we were done. Like a whole plate of noodles. They usually box your food in front of you but for some reason he took our food away and came back with everything in a bag. When I opened it up today, it was missing A LOT of food. Like not even half of our leftovers were in there. Super disappointed and regret giving him a good tip. You live and you learn.",92108

But, I'm sorry. It looks, tastes, and has a texture like Minute Rice or Uncle Ben's. Real rice is sticky, and feels moist when you eat it. It doesn't fall apart, and it doesn't feel springy and dry in your mouth.I also never asked, but I'm almost certain that they don't use real soy sauce. Theirs tastes more like Chun King, a salt water version of soy sauce. Which would explain why some of the dishes tasted overly salty.If I were in search of Kung Pao or any of their other dishes, I would search for another place.IMHO, this place is an over-priced Panda Express, without the express.",92108

I like that they take reservations now, and you can do it on-line. We had reservations for 5:30, but we were so hungry we showed up at 5:10 but still had to wait till 5:30 cuz it was crazy-crowded. It's nice when you can breeze right by the non-reservation people. Oh how I wish Chili's would take reservations... We considered and rejected the Price Fixe Menu because the entree selection was a bit lacking. I was torn between fish or tofu, neither of which is on the Price Fixe menu (really? no fish? how odd...). We ordered tofu lettuce wraps for starters and with the sauces mixed at your table, they were extremely yummy We also had Hot and Sour Soup and it was AWESOME. Not just good, not just really good, but AWESOME. I can hear the Chinese food aficionados pursing their lips disapprovingly right now, but hey, I've had this soup in teeny authentic Chinese places from SF to Hawaii and I can say, this has been the best so far. I don't like it when it's so hot I can't enjoy it, and I like the fact that they're not too cowardly to put the little black seaweed pieces in it like they're supposed to. For my entree I wound up ordering Ma Po Tofu, and hubby had Lemon Grass Prawns. Both were very good. Serving sizes were good, I pigged out and ate all mine (but hey, it's tofu, c'mon, don't give me a hard time), but hubby had to have a take-home box. Seeing as how I love Red Velvet Cake more than life itself, I would loved to have tried the mini-cake shot thingys, but I already felt guilty about eating all the tofu, and I was planning to consume copious amounts of champagne later in the evening so I was trying to limit the caloric intake (why do I torture myself so?). All in all, food was yummy, service was very good (server was gorgeous and looked like a 60s actress), wait was fine with reservations. We even found parking. Sweet.",92108

I've always been a big fan of P.F. Chang's because face it, it's consistently delicious. I've never once dined here and thought to myself....wow that sucked. Because it doesn't. Yes it's a chain. Yes it's super American. But, ya know what? It's super tasty. I love choosing local places, and in SF it was much easier to eat locally then try and find a chain restaurant anywhere. But here in San Diego it's a lot easier...especially around big shopping centers. Is it something I would do all the time? Heck no. That would equate to getting really fat, and I'm just not into that idea. Rant over.I like a lot of things about this chain. I also like a lot of their dishes (Mongolian Beef, Orange Peel Chicken, Lettuce Wraps, etc. etc.). What I especially liked about this location was that it had decent outdoor seating that was much less crowded than their overly air conditioned indoor seating. It felt nice to be American and sip lemon water on their patio, and eat overly priced Chinese inspired dishes. Especially with the mindset that we were going to shop the rest of the afternoon. We also had a clear view of The Container Store, a place I had never been to before. By the end of the meal, I had my heart set on checking it out...since I am clearly a big fan of containers. The waiters were also all surprisingly good looking and friendly, so that was nice too. Also, as soon as my friend was half way down with his ice tea, he promptly received a new glass, filling him to the brim with caffeine. He was ok with that. I was ok with them continuously filling my water glass, until I started shopping and had to use the bathroom after every store we went into to.

The hostess needs a lot of more training in hospitality. She didn't say hello when we first walked in, she put up her finger to signal one second. That's pretty rude. I used to host before as well, so I know how overwhelming it could be. But it was not busy nor was there a wait so I don't understand why she did that. We were seated, our waiter was probably the best. He came over, greeted us, took our drink orders and appetizers. Let me tell you, they bring that appetizer out so fast, but it's the total opposite with the main dishes. With how long it took, I thought it'd be the best plate of Chinese food I'd ever have. Honestly, it taste like Panda Express. Their honey chicken is served with way too many of the crispy rice sticks! Way too little rice. Just not what I expected. As we walked out, I said good night and thank you to the hostess, they just looked at me like I had something on my face.

Could it have been better? Hmm, I don't think so. Dessert was whatever too. Yeah...I like authentic. P.F.Changs = NOT authentic.",92108

We waited about 30 minutes and were escorted to our table.We ordered the Ahi Crisps as an appetizer, which were delicious, which reminded me of poki on a tortilla chip. For our main dish Hunan Style Hot Fish, which has a nice kick to it and Sweet and Sour Chicken.The food I have no complaints about, as I have ordered take-out from PF Chang's a few times already, however the service experience I had was not very good. Our server started off very good, he was prompt at taking our orders and serving us our drinks. Then his friends arrived and sat at the table next to ours and our server spent more time talking to them about surfing and how their gratuity is divided, to notice that we needed a refill on our drinks.

It jiggled more than Pam Anderson playing volleyball. Not cute nor yummy. The noodle dish was gluey salt mash, the rice noodles overcooked to a pulp.  The poor little asparagus cowered under a blanket of- you guessed it- SALT! Alright already, I know PF ain't first rate or authentic. I get it. But we were desperately hungry and had tolerable chang-speriences before, in Eugene Oregon, where the horse-flanked restaurant in considered great dining.

Two different times I have ordered the ginormous chocolate raspberry cake. The first time it was to die for. The second time, here in SD, it was rather dry. There is nothing worse than dry cake.

The family ""friend"" and my brother chose it as the place my brother wanted to go to for his last time eating out before he went to India, and after seeing the rating here on Yelp I was skeptical, but went along with it anyways.Let me just start by saying that the food is mediocre at best. It wasn't bland, but it didn't stand out either. Between the five of us we ordered the Salt & Pepper Shrimp, Wok Seared Lamb, Peppered Steak, Sweet & Sour Chicken, Chicken Lo Mein and Vegetable Fried Rice. I only ate the Salt & Pepper Shrimp, Wok Seared Lamp and Peppered Beef so I will leave my impression for these dishes only.Salt & Pepper Shrimp: Bland, marked as spicy but I didn't detect any hints of spice other than a touch of pepper. Is ""stir fried"" but seemed like it was sitting around for an hour or so as it was mushy. For $18.00 you would think you would at least get a decent portion, but it came with only 12 medium sized shrimp. Pathetic.Wok Seared Lamb: The lamb was bland and wasn't seasoned at all. Tasted more like thinly sliced flank steak than lamb. The bed of vegetables were soggy also like they had been sitting around for an hour. Again, the portion was meager for $16.00.Peppered Steak: If you've ever had broccoli beef this isn't very different. The sauce was a little savory but had no peppery flavor to it at all. The ""steak"" was like the beef from broccoli beef. Not quite chewy, but it wasn't very firm either. I was expecting more, especially for how much the food cost. The service wasn't prompt. Took almost 15 minutes after ordering my second beer for it to come. The waiter had no personality and you could tell he was just there to do a job and get out. First time I have given a 15% tip in over three years. Overall I will never go back and I will not ever recommend this place to anyone. Your money is better spent almost anywhere else. Try Panda Inn in Horton Plaza. A little cheaper and much better food.",92108

I don't know what it is but it has so much flavor. The tofu actually has very similar consistency to chicken which I really enjoy. I've tried it many other Chinese restaurants and their just not the same.   I've had the chicken lettuce wraps at PF Changs once or twice and to tell you the truth, they are nowhere as good.  I don't like the fact that they grind the chicken.  Other items that are pretty good are the Shrimp Lo Mein and Mongolian Chicken. I'm not much of a beef fan so I always have them substitute the beef for chicken.A new favorite of mine is the Chilean Sea Bass. Although it's one of the most expensive items on the menu, I do enjoy how it has spinach in it.  The flavor is so good.I have tried many other items on the menu but the ones I've listed are the ones I will come back for again and again.",92108

I love PF Chang's and coming out here is usually a treat but yesterday was the first miss I've experienced here. I believe my server said her name was Chelsea and while she was trying to be attentive (I think someone called out or something as she was running around quite a bit) our late lunch turned out to be not so great. We ordered Lo Mein, which is a staple for when we come here. It came out looking as if it was from the previous day. (We always try to order enough food for leftovers so I'm familiar with whether the food I order is fresh or not.) Now this may have been because maybe they used a little too much sauce, but I'm fairly certain the food was just old. The mongolian beef was delicious as always and always a pleaser. Our pork fried rice came out ok but the pork had been overcooked, luckily we got pork in the Lo Mein so we simply used the pork from that dish instead as it did come with plenty. Our server for the day was quick at refilling our drinks when they ran low, not even having to ask for it; however we never received rice on the side which usually comes with our entree. I believe that to be a genuine mistake of the moment so I don't really blame anyone for it however it is worth noting.Overall lunch could have been better. I won't say I won't be back as I do love PF Chang's and I've only ever had one bad experience at PF Chang's before (I've been to 4 or so locations) so I think I've just been lucky up until now. One star was for the quick drink refill, the second was for the mongolian beef. The three that were lost were from, 1) the missing rice, 2) the old Lo Mein, 3) the overcooked pork.",92108

Our server seemed a little ditzy, but maybe its just because she was busy? It was the height of the dinner rush.

This was our first mistake.For a 2-person table, the wait was 1.5 hours. Being optimistic, we put our name on the list. After waiting for an hour, being stepped on and shoved out of the way in their lobby/waiting area, we decided to find out from the 3 hostitutes how much longer it would be for us, considering we could see tables sitting empty. We were told by another host than the one we initially spoke with,  it would be another 45 minutes. Having to wait that long for a table for 2 people is unacceptable, so we decided to just get take-out. We were told by the host to go to the bar to order take out. The bartenders were way to busy to even notice us, and the area where we were supposed to place our take out order was located right beside the kitchen door, and we were once again, being bumped into and shoved out of the way by waitstaff hurrying in and out of the kitchen. After waiting several minutes to place a take-out order and having no success, we finally gave up and left.The frozen pizza we ate at home for dinner was less than satisfying after waiting for so f-n long at PF Changs.Overall: SInce they do not take reservations, their waiting area was overpacked, we waited over an hour, hosts were not friendly and incredibly unorganized, service for take out was inadequate, and we left without ever even tasting their food... I can't say that I was pleased with our visit.BOO, PF Changs... BOO.",92108

Liam was our server and I highly suggest he choose a different career path...something that doesn't include smiling or customer service.He was very short with my friend and I, none attentive (the other guy who helped us get a refill was super cool-there's hope!), spilled soup everywhere that I hadn't even touched (because it came out 15 mins after my meal..which my friend had to get up and ask for) and didn't offer to get me a new one while he's boxing up my food...thought asking for my food Togo would include wanting my soup Togo as well but guess he thought otherwise...who likes soup?I didn't care that he spilled-shit happens. But the fact that he didn't even attempt to clean up the mess as its dripping on my leg and onto the floor..really man?

A 50 dollar gift card covered one hell of a dinner and all of the selections on their menu sounded fantastic. Being a Chinese food safety-ist I always end up with some kind of egg drop soup, broccoli beef, and some white rice, and maybe another dish if I'm feeling bold. I was highly impressed with the quality and it was filling without sending my full belly over the edge. If you realllly want to find the deal in here for eating on the cheap, order a bowl of soup. Their bowl is no weenie size bowl that Goldilocks had, no, this is BIG Papa Bear size x 5. The big bowl is only 2 bucks more than the Goldilocks size and I think the server said it's like 6 cups of soup in there. So glad we didn't order one for each of us! Anyhow, the bowl of soup is like 6 dollars and is perfection until the last drop. Also, stake out bar seating if you're down for food before waiting for a formal table. We cut eleventy billion guests who were too good to sit at the bar and we were in and out before they could blink an eye! Props to P.F. Changs for offering late-ish night dining perfect to answer cravings for food that are far past when they really should be...The servers are nice in here and keep a positive attitude even though this place gets busy and customers can be bananas; If you lose anything in here such as a cellphone (left in the ladies bathroom) or as the lady claimed, a Sephora bag she JUST SPENT 184.31 on and then demanded the bar tenders stop what they are doing any look for it (get a grip lady) the servers are sweet and will hold possessions for you with their manager until they are confident you are in fact the rightful owner.

I never had a piece of fish from a restaurant that was cooked to such perfection.  It came on a bed of spinach which sealed the deal.  After eating here and realizing that I didn't live so far from a PF changes in NY I thought it would be my new favorite restaurant, but that's not the case (read my review for the NY PF Changs).  Again, its unfortunate that I have to rate each location with three stars, but here it's solely based on the drinks.  I also think the portions are pretty skimpy at PF changes as an overall franchise (we only split our meal because we had A LOT of appetizers), but that's what you get with these types of places.  Any who, I'd definitely come back to PF Changs at Fashion Valley and I would recommend anyone to come if they're looking for something different and delicious!",92108

Got seated in a reasonable amount of time. We asked to move to a booth and they accommodated without making faces.They do have a teeny weeny vegetarian section on the menu now, and vegetarian lettuce wraps for starters. Our waiter however informed me that he did not know if the lettuce wraps were vegan, and his manner said he did not give a damn too. Lettuce is not meat and the menu description didn't say anything about cheese, so I ordered it anyway.  It was delish.I didn't bother to ask him if the Buddha's Feast is vegan, but I'm pretty sure it is.  It's pretty darn good.  And they now serve brown rice.  And they have a full bar.  So that's 3 stars.Outstanding service would have made it 4 stars but it just isn't there yet.

We happened to have the same waiter named Vince from the first time. Service was great food was good. Pretty much another great experience........ until Monday today. I got a call from my mother saying that she was over charged for her bill which she paid for separately. What happened was my girlfriend and I paid for bulk of the meal which was about 52 total including tip. This was paid with cash. My mom paid 8.59 for her little portion she wanted. The same waiter charged her our amount. So it comes off looking like he pocketed the money.

I have tried many things on the menu and found all of them to be poorly prepared (overcooked/dry/etc.) except for one thing, the black cod. Unfortunately this is also the most expensive thing on the menu, so you end up paying like three times what your hippie friends are paying for their twigs and leaves. Anyway, the black cod is moist and delicious, with a bed of spinach. It's soaking in a dark miso soy type sauce. Kind of extremely salty, but I like that.

Only real complaint is the past few times the service has been so hit or miss! The last time the server was obviously having a bad night or something, not friendly, didn't mix our sauce until we asked him too, and just not real attentive. Another time our server did such a bad job, we asked someone else walking by for help, and the next time our server came around she sarcastically said, thanks for getting her in trouble! Crazy.. anyways, food is always good. Kind of funny seeing everyone talk about how the food isn't ""authentic"" and not ""healthy chinese"".. first off, isn't that an oxy moron? And second.. does PF changs market and claim to be either of these? Maybe I am missing something.. as far as I knew.. it's a chain chinese restaurant! Who cares if it's not authentic.Lettuce wraps are always excellent, the crispy green beans ""More addictive than potato chips"" description on the menu couldn't be more true!! this is my absolute new favorite I will be getting every time from now on whenever we are at pf changs.

For my meal, I had mushu pork, which came with tortillas like the ones at the grocery store to wrap them in, but it was actually very tasty and a lot of food! J had their version of general gao's chicken which he says tastes like orange chicken. Taking into account that this is a chain place, I think it was very good for what it is. If I had to go to a chain place again, and a PF Chang's was around, I'd go again.  Just remember, this isnt supposed to be chinese food. It's chain food. If you think of that, its pretty good.  This one was clean and friendly.",92108

It was crowded as usual and we waited about 15 minutes for our table but once we were seated it was a pleasant experience. Our waiter Kirby (from Tennessee) was wonderful. Very upbeat and attentive. We ordered the prix-fixe menu for two, which includes soup, starter, two entrees from an abbreviated list and two mini desserts. We had the hot and sour soup, crispy green beans starter, Kung Pao shrimp and sesame chicken. Everything was well prepared, tasty and generous portions. The mini desserts were excellent. We each had the wall--a mini-chocolate cake in a tall shot glass. Just enough sweetness. Even the iced tea was great. Best part of the experience was the service. Kirby and his tag team partner, Jordan, were excellent throughout our meal. I don't know what P.F. Chang's here does to screen their waitstaff applicants but all of them seem so personable and hardworking!",92108

The food was great, but the whole experience left us shocked and saddened. We never considered the idea that PF Chang's would not be appropriate for children. We are very sensitive to disturbing others and work hard to ensure our children behave themselves in public. Apparently, the staff believe it is adults only despite the children's menu and available high chairs. We came for dinner on a Monday evening with a four year old and a two year old. The hostesses looked at us like we were crazy for walking into their restaurant. We were seated in the middle of the restaurant even though there were plenty of other options available that would have been more appropriate for us. The waitress glared at us throughout dinner, had a huge attitude, and we noticed she continually appeared to be discussing our table from across the room with other wait staff. After we were finished, she disappeared and we were left waiting for the check. My wife took the kids out of the restaurant and I waited for the check. The waitress finally came over and said, ""Should I bring the check or are you just going to leave?"" She received a fourteen cent tip. We will never go back to this restaurant and you shouldn't either.",92108

Gee, only Domestic Draft beers were $3 and the choices were very small ! I just decided to get a $4 Corona. I asked her if it came in a frosted mug, she answered ""it's chilled"".  I'm very picky about how cold my beer is. Well, just as I thought.....it wasn't very cold.

Anyways, the cook busts out best they can given this is not their true passion or dream job and the dishwasher can barely stand touching/scrubbing that food on the plate that that cook put there.""Not today onion! You don't DESERVE to be scrubbed off this plate-I saw who put you there!"" And then that plate, fork, chopstick, appetizer plate dries with the carcass of the meal that came before it....just waiting for some middle aged lady to notice and politely (in her strongest valley girl accent ) ask for a clean plate and fork. She thinks first to use her hands, but-you know-manners. Service agrees , views the food and gets a fresh one without food chunks on it.The pork dumplings-a potsticker were advertised as pan Fried. Definitely cooked on one side which meant one side had a slight crisp and other side was gummy and not all cooked.The steak entree was a large piece of meat with Thick  pieces of fat on its ends, thickly cut on top of basic b potatoes (think a fancy chuck-o-Rama buffet dish)(This dish came barely warm)-spouse still ate it because #obviouslywilleatmycooking The crispy orange chicken was soggy (the batter was gooey inside and the fried rice noodles were stale. The rice (just basic rice) was not executed well. I understand why the dishwasher broke up with the cook (especially if that cook was the one insisting on making the meals in the place they once shared.The manager was receptive and wanted to compensate the non cooked chicken (I legit told him he didn't have to-my husband even ate the cold gnarly steak!). Given I don't eat in person very often these days cleanliness and hot food is a bit more under scrutiny for me. Nice people, but pricing and execution are a huge miss-I would not recommend coming here The mango tea was great! *Of course I don't know if the cook has dreams of becoming a beef jerky entrepreneur, or if they wear a big hat (obvi)-maybe SHE wants to be a BBQ master...we will never know",92008

Due to COVID, they are requiring you make a reservation online so that they can plan their seating for the evening, so definitely do that before heading in! It was super easy and ensured us a spot on a busy Friday evening. We ended up ordering all of our items off of the Happy Hour menu- crab wontons, chicken lettuce wraps, spicy tuna roll, and pear mojito's. The mojito's were so good and had a really good crisp pear taste, which was perfect for a hot day. My favorite appetizer was the crab wontons which came with a super good sweet and sour sauce. I was pleasantly surprised with the spicy tuna roll which was super fresh and had large chunks of fish on the inside. I was not expecting their sushi to be as good as it was, and definitely recommend ordering a couple of rolls. All Happy Hour food items are $6-$7 which I think is such a great deal, especially if you are looking for a light dinner. Our service was absolutely impeccable during the whole time we were eating. Our waitress was attentive, accommodating, and was so kind to my mom and I. I did not catch her name, but she definitely is the reason for the 5 stars.

1989,"5621 Paseo Del Norte Carlsbad, CA 92008",Martha M.,"San Marcos, CA",6/23/2021,2,"I just had a weird experience that I want to share here. Earlier today, I bought one of my favorites, the chicken lettuce wraps. I took it home and started to eat them when I noticed that something was off, the rice puffs that come with this dish were hard to bite into (they were either stale or not completely fried). I was able to separate most of the meat from the rice puffs that had been placed underneath, but the bottom portion was pretty mixed with the puffs. Even though I could eat some of the meat with the pieces of lettuce and the accompanying sauce, not adding the rice puffs and leaving a portion of the dish out made my eating experience less enjoyable.I then decided to call the restaurant to let them know about this. When I spoke to the manager (forgot his name), he told me, to my surprise, that the rice puffs are just a garnish and they are not supposed to be eaten at all. I just can't believe this since I have always eaten them with my lettuce wraps and have never had this problem. And let's assume that what the manager told me is correct, and that no one is to be eating these rice puffs, why would they mix them with the meat in a way that they can't be easily separated?",92008

George at the bar was more than accommodating with our drink requests and was happy to stop and talk with us while still ensuring his guests got everything they needed. We only got a couple of drinks and appetizers but with our drink ingredient substitutions we can be somewhat complicated customers. George was completely unfazed by our requests and he delivered on them too. Another employee that went above and beyond was Mia, who was very courteous and pleasant. We have passed by this PF Changs a hundred times (I even used to work across the street at the outlet mall) and never came in but this visit ensured that I will be back.",92008

So I got the orange chicken and the hot and sour soup. The soup was delicious my chicken on the other hand was congealed and very cold. It felt as if the batter wasn't cooked all the way which makes me very disappointed because I spent $20 on something that was cold.,92008
1993,"5621 Paseo Del Norte Carlsbad, CA 92008",Alex G.,"Tacoma, WA",9/7/2019,3,"The best part about this restaurant is the atmosphere. It has a cool, unique vibe. That makes it a fun spot to have a drink, meet up with friends, etc.I've tried a few different dishes here. Everything I tried has been very sweet, to the point where I can barely pick up flavors other than just sugar. It's not my thing, but if you like very sweet dishes you may enjoy it.To the extent that recipes are not actually traditional Chinese recipes, this restaurant should be viewed as an Asian fusion restaurant in which dishes have been (heavily) modified for a broader American palate.The service definitely will vary, as it will at any major chain. Service here is typically very good, with servers being attentive and helpful.I appreciate that it's kept very clean in the restaurant, and that there's plenty of seating.",92008

Chang's so after a long morning at the Outlets, we decided to go their for lunch. It's right across the street from the mall and a short walk away from the Palisades resort if you're close by! However, for the first time ever, there was a mixup with our order. We ordered lettuce wraps as an appetizer and never received them. When we got the bill, we were charged for them. However, we told our amazing waiter Mason, and he took it off the receipt. As we were getting ready to leave, the lettuce wraps suddenly came out (the kitchen apparently forgot about them). But they were nice enough to box them up for us to take to-go. They were very apologetic about it and handled the situation very well! Besides that, we had a very pleasant experience! I really want to give a shout-out to Mason because he was so helpful and very kind. The food was served warm and the service was quick!",92008

Chang's is a chain restaurant with a certain reputation for quality, and that sometimes results in individual locations slacking off - I'm pleased to report that this link in the chain delivers all the taste and quality I've come to expect.  The food was outstanding!My favorite dishes from my initial visit to this location were the Mongolian Beef, the Orange Peel Chicken, and the crispy Green Beans.  Between the delicious food and a couple of Asian Pear Mojitos, I sent home a VERY happy camper :-)",92008

Anyone expecting anything even close to OMG SO 100% AUTHENTIC lacks key critical thinking skills and shouldn't be allowed to review any food until they get right.Anyway, I usually come here either to eat with my boss or get take out. If you like to save money, then download their app and get on their email list. Each week they usually send great offers like a free meal when you buy one, or free appetizer when you buy an entree. Usually you can use these coupons for take out! Last week I was able to get a free full order of dynamite shrimp, just by ordering an entree. I really like their dynamite shrimp! Fried shrimp drenched in a calorie filled sauce is just what my tummy wants when my day has been rough! It is a bit too salty when you gobble it down in your car ... not that I did that...no sir!So, it saved me $12 or so...My usual entree is the eggplant with extra sauce. I get extra sauce because it makes it reheat better. After all, after scarfing down a whole app, I usually am stuffed! It is a solid if not safe dish. A savory sauce with a large amount of eggplant. Lots of garlic! I like to add hot sauce to it. This dish is about $12 as well. Take out is usually right on time and it's all pretty standard from there. If you see a woman eating dynamite shrimp in the parking lot, come over and say hello!",92008

The red curry dish comes with tofu, which made my husband pause before we ordered it, but we are so glad we did! In fact, the tofu looked like a mushroom on the plate and just soaked up that delicious red curry flavor. This place was not busy on a Tuesday night at 7. Plus, it's big inside and they have patio seating. Appetizer + two entrees brought us to $37 + tip.",92008

I stand by that review. So you can imagine my surprise when I nervously decided to check out this location 10 years later and ended up loving my food and overall experience. Our server Whitney was fantastic! She was warm, welcoming and made some recommendations. I know people complain about P.F. Chang's not being ""authentic Chinese food"" but I thoroughly enjoyed my food that day. What we ordered:-Honey Shrimp with honeydew: I'm not sure how I felt about the honeydew but the perfectly cooked shrimp and glazed walnuts complimented each other well. A classic dish that always makes my stomach happy.-Chicken Fried Rice: just your standard chicken fried rice but it was tasty and filling. Parking is okay but can get hairy on the weekends due to the Carlsbad Outlet Mall being located across the street. Ambience modern and inviting and service outstanding. I love when a simple experience can change my opinion about an entire restaurant chain. Thank you Whitney!",92008

Tons of flavor the sauce it comes with has a nice spicy kick defiantly can taste the hot mustard in there, let's face it that stuff will clear the sinus right up. We also had the orange chicken, this is the fried kind of orange chicken so it was good, not over the top but good. We also had the honey chicken I thought that was really good lots of flavor and a good honey taste. Finally we added chicken fried rice, I liked the flavor and the amount of chicken, the chicken was in nice size bits not like chopped into little pieces so your wondering what is that. Good job guys and gals. Everything came out hot and tasted fresh we were all happy.Service- Well in all fair ness I'll say the place was packed, everyone coming from Legoland and the outlets. Our server was trying his hardest, he was slow however he was nice as can be and was really trying, I like to give the ones trying a break since they are trying, unlike those ones that are just uncaring and taking their time. Our waiter interacted and asked my son how his birthday was going and that is rare these days, they normally just drop the food and are off. Sometimes it's worth the wait.Inside- They were trying to keep it as clean as possible,however when you have big families with small kids that drop food all over the floor it's a hard job. I can only imagine how their homes look, I would never leave a place looking so bad, but hey that's just me! There were two managers the female manager was always running around cleaning tables and using the vacuum to clean the floors, good job on her. Good job guys!",92008

Chang's.  I don't understand why people like this place.   The food is over-priced and totally not worth it.   You can find a hole in the wall food joint and get the same food or better and pay 20-30% less.  We ordered take-out, so maybe if you dine in the food is better/different?  Probably not, but that's the only reason I gave two stars (vs 1)...giving them the benefit of the doubt.  We ordered pad Thai noodles with shrimp and crispy honey chicken with brown rice.  Pad Thai -  I've had pad Thai dozens of times and this was below average.   Definitely not the worst, but well below average.   We literally counted 3 tiny shrimp in the entire meal!   What the heck?   3 small shrimp?   We're paying ~$18 for noodles with 3 shrimp.   Step it up and throw some shrimp in the dish and stop being so stingy.   It's a lot cheaper to make a decent meal and provide some shrimp and have us come back than lose a customer.  Crispy Honey Chicken-  this was just plain gross.  The chicken was not crispy whatsoever.   The chicken was just loaded in sauce and super soggy.   We literally tried to cook/bake the chicken in our toaster oven to further cook it because it was so soggy.  Definitely would not recommend.  The brown rice was good if that counts for anything though....Our bill for pad Thai (with 3 shrimp) and crispy (soggy) honey chicken was $38 for take out!   Are you kidding?   I can go to a hole in the wall Chinese place or Thai place and get two good dishes for a total of $25-$30 on average or about 20%-30% less than what I paid here.  Not impressed.   Won't be ordering take out from here ever again.",92008

This location has a nice bar set up and perfect for happy hour. We picked up a Costco $100 gift card for $80 and headed over after shopping. I started off with their new Mongolian potstickers. Delicious! Crispy but still full of flavor and juicy. I haven't had anything on the menu I didn't like! The portions are large, perfect for sharing or get two and split!

While it won't knock your socks off, it's good enough to keep us coming back. Two things I don't like.... they don't know how to cook stir-fry broccoli. Time after time it comes out crunchy, not cooked enough.Also I wish management would train staff to quit saying, ""Is everything tasting okay?"" What a lame question.  It's just as stupid as a customer asking, ""Is the chicken salad fresh?""  A more relevant question would be, ""May I get you anything...is everything okay?"" Also please don't refer to the guest as 'guy'....""How's everything goin', guys?"" Up your game and get more professional.....One thing I didn't like is we were here once and the server accidentally dropped a plate of schezwan green beans in my purse which was sitting on a chair. Accidents do happen but it's how you handle it that matters.That was  a brand new designer purse, ruined because it still smells of that dish. They comped us for the cost of the green beans..... rather cheap since the purse was ruined. They should have either replaced or offered to professionally clean the purse (if that was even possible) or comp the dinner ticket.",92008

The recipes have gotten really bad. Kung pao chicken or shrimp used to be fantastic. Now it's the worst option to pick.

When I got the order home I was less than impressed. My family and I usually order the same meal while eating at the restaurant, but the portions for the to go order were much smaller. I've seen other Yelpers mention the same thing, so I guess I'm not the only unlucky one. The shrimp was ok but the Mongolian beef just tasted off and just didn't have much beef.

Chang's for a hot meal for the first time in probably five years. I've always like the dim lighting at P.F. Chang's.  I was seated at a nice table tucked into a corner but I did feel like the table was too high for the bench.   Anyway, on to food, I started with the won-ton soup which was surprisingly lacking flavor.  From there it was on to an entrée.  Unfortunately I didn't realize or remember that P.F. Chang's is family style so that wasn't a great setup when dining by myself.  I ordered the Mongolian beef with brown rice which had great flavor but some pieces were very fatty.  My server was friendly and attentive so that was a bright spot in the meal.  The soup, beef, an iced tea and tip were $35.  While I do have enough leftovers for another meal, I still don't feel like it was a $35 well spent. The bar was 100% full at 6pm so I suspect this might be a good happy hour spot.  It seems their lettuce wraps are popular.I think I will give it another five years before returning.",92008

But every dish was barely above warm, and every dish was under seasoned! We sent our egg drop soup back because it was cold, she popped it into the microwave and brought it back.

The soup was a bit gelatinous compared to others I've had elsewhere. It was okay.Kung Pao Chicken - Not sure why this cost 16.50 when the Orange Peel chicken ( and others) only cost 13.50. Chang's really up-charges for spicy dishes? I recently had Kung Pao Chicken at Pei Wei and loved it there. Chang's version was good and the chicken was perfect, but it was muted in flavor compared to the Pei Wei version. With Chang's higher price, I'd have to say pass on it here.Orange Peel Chicken - A bit too mild for me. I generally like my Orange Chicken to be more pungent with a wallop of vinegar zing. It was good, but don't anticipate getting Panda Express style here.Lo Mein - Colorful and delicious.  A no-brainier when looking for a noodle dish to complement your meal.Your fortune cookie says....At close to double the price of Pei Wei, it's still best to save P.F. Chang's for celebratory meals. The quality is noticeably better at Chang's but in the end the cost of Pei Wei wins for overall value. Kandi was a great server..",92008

I reheat 3 day old Chinese better than this crap. What a disgrace. The server had the personality of cardboard. There was one nice blonde lady who I have to give credit for.

His dismissive explanation was that the food had been sitting in the Google area the whole time. The food was predictably cold and terribly hard to digest.

It was my wife, my son, and myself. The appetizers were ok, the ribs dry rub, felt like they were cooked yesterday. Disappointing. I ordered the wok cooked fillet mignon. It said 8oz. Sliced. It came out looking like steak hash with the largest piece being onions. I callEd it dog food because it was chopped up like a baby. It was chopped up for a baby. It was not sliced.Honestly for 22.00. It was absolutely the worst main item of the evening on our table.I mean for that price with little atmosphere, it was not good. Just to show you I'm straight up, they also peppered the heck out of it and I love pepper but geez, here is the picture. See the little pieces of steak you call fillet mignot slices. It was disappointing that's all I'm saying. With so many options I would never come back even if I got a gift card. Pricey wanna be Panda is what it felt like.",92008

Chang's for what it was:  Asian-American food (mashup of Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Thai, and Vietnamese).  Their lettuce wraps and garlic green beans were the best out there.  I won't harp on them too much today for old time's sake.  Ordered ~$40 for take out, including MaPo Tofu and this is what we got (see picts). And for a $40 order, you'd think they'd give a little bit more rice (btw that's a small container). White rice cost like pennies...c'mon P.F.!",92008

I hadn't had Chinese food in almost two years and this is an option for me if I really have a craving. Ask the host/hostess for a gluten free menu if you need one.The service here is mediocre at best. We had to ask for things multiple times and some items were never even brought out. We asked for soup and it was never brought to the table so we asked to not be charged for it once the food came out. Not bad service, just not great.The food is pretty good but it's expensive for what you get. I really do come here because it's one of the only gluten free Chinese menus I've ever seen.

But the best part of this by far, was Skylar the hostess.After everyone left, I tried to start my car, and the battery was dead. I asked the girl at the front if anyone had jumper cables and within five minutes Skylar appeared with a pair of them and took time out of her busy night to drive her car up next to mine and help me start it. In my opinion, this was going above and beyond the call of duty, and shows exemplary commitment to customer satisfaction. it made me feel like I was at a five-star restaurant or hotel where they will accommodate your needs no matter how extensive. It is simple dedication to customer satisfaction, and people like that will go far in their industry. So thank you Skylar, PF Chang's is lucky to have you!

I don't remember it being served this way. Food was uninspiring. Service was very slow. It took about 10 minutes before anyone took our drink order. From the time we ordered our food, it took about half an hour. And when we were done, it took a good 15 minutes before our waiter gave the bill, then another 10 minutes to take our card for payment.

The American twist that they infuse into their inauthentic food has grown on me and sometimes I need a fix.This location boasts the majestic 11 foot tall horse which is a symbol of China's forbidden city, but the positioning prevents diners from having to look up the horse's ass while dining. Looking up that crack has never caused me to lose my appetite, but a dining partner always takes a seat with his back to the crack. I guess PF Chang's picked up on that and newer restaurants have reconfigured the mascot.Kung pao is my hero, but it takes sweet talking the chef to get them to make this dish sans it's chicken broth base. Pair Kung pao scallops with lettuce wraps for a spicy, sweet, crunchy meal that activates your taste buds. All of this flavor is bound to leave you thirsty, everything is loaded with enough sodium to dry you right up! So drink all of the free water that you can and thank me later.Inside the spacious dining area you will discover high ceilings, diffuse mood lighting, comfortable booths and and arched full bar. Their extended happy hour at the bar is a great way to wrap up a day of fun or work. The lineup of small plates under $10 includes their famous vegetarian lettuce wraps and ahi tartare at a price that puts a big smile on my face. They dropped the dynamite shrimp from the small plates menu, that put a frown on my face.The prices are higher than most Chinese food, and with their smaller portions it is hardly a bargain.

Covid 19 lockdown means a monotonous routine of meals so we order takeaway to break that routine. Tonight we ordered from PF Changs. I only received 2 out of the 3 entrees I ordered! The 2 I received were horrible. The Kung Pao chicken was dry and tasteless, with almost no sauce, no peanuts, 5 slices of celery, and 4 chilis the chicken was heavily battered and cold. For $3.00 extra I had ordered fried rice which was dry, hard, and tasteless as well. The Buddas feast was essentially par-cooked broccoli, a few slices of carrot 3 green beans, and rubbery tofu with a little tasteless sauce. I thought the only redeeming item was the chocolate cake we were splitting and that was because they probably don't make it themselves. Then I opened the container of fruit garnish for the cake to find a lump of moldy strawberry bits and shriveled blueberries. Really, shame on PF Changs! We used to love their food but I guess when they don't have to look you in the eye as you eat it they just don't give a hoot about quality!!

Their dishes are family style so if you are ordering an entree keep in mind on how big the portions will be served. We started off with the BBQ spare ribs, the quality was impeccable. The tender, juicy meat ripped right off the bone and the sauce was perfectly seasoned and had me licking my fingers. I also started with an order of the crab wontons. However, I was not impressed; the spicy plum sauce did not compliment the taste and the crab stuffing was nothing great. For our entrees we ordered a classic, Chang's Spicy Chicken as well as the Combination Lo Mein noodles. The chicken wasn't as spicy as I expected, the sauce was actually quite sweet.

At the end of our meal, we gave the waitress our new account number to get our discount, and she told us it was invalid and suggested we talk to the manager again.  When the manager came over, he was in complete disbelief that we had a coupon for a free entree and that the deal of the day was honey chicken.  Mind you, he had told us 20 minutes before that we'd get the buy one get one free by signing up. Then, he went on to say that by signing up, we only get rewards on the second time dining in.  It would've been completely fine if the manager explained things in a way that didn't make us sound stupid, but he was extremely rude and acted as if our conversation 20 minutes prior never happened.

Andrew recognized the impolite fashion that was conducted here and quickly shut it down.

It took too long to take our order when the restaurant was only 10% full (it was one hour before closing), the server was very ""blue collar"" and seemed like she was better fit to work in a truck stop diner as she was kind of rough around the edges. She needed to be reminded of little things like sauces, drinks, box, etc. The dining area seemed nice, just like some other locations, but the restrooms were dirty at the time we went.  Paper towels were all over place.This PF Changs location needs to have it re-evaluated by the head office as the operator is not keeping it up to their national standard.

We could not believe how unsatisfying this meal was when we got home. The lo mein had no taste; the crispy egg rolls were very bland and the vegetables in the egg rolls and in our entrees were very tough and hard to chew through; the sauces did not taste at all like we've had at other locations; the small box of white rice was only 2/3 full (while the box of brown rice we received was full as we usually see our boxes of rice).

Our main course came first before the appetizers, the waiter was very apologetic for forgetting to put our appetizer order in, but the weird part is we got one of the dish instead of 4 appetizers. So I don't know if he's just claiming the blame. about half hour, more people comes in and every single table that get seated ask if theres more lightning or candles or something because its pretty dim inside. You can see people using their phones to read the menu. Such a weird vibe to me. I don't recommend this place to anybody. I hope the other PF Changs locations have better atmosphere and food.",92008

It tastes more like fried rice than pad Thai - oddly enough.I also ordered the chicken and there was maybe 4 total ounces of chicken on the dish- or roughly four bites. Also there were HUGE pieces of green onions on the noodles. Were they too lazy or busy to dice them? Who wants to eat five inch long pieces of green onion?!

I used to go here all the time but the service has continued to get worse and worse. I ordered takeout about a month I go and ordered lettuce wraps but they forgot to include lettuce with my order. As you can imagine I didn't want to come back to pick up lettuce and unfortunately I didn't have any lettuce in my refrigerator.  I called to inform them of this error and I was put on hold to talk to the manager.  She finally came on the line and told me that since I paid cash and couldnt refund my card that she would place notes in the system that next time I came in they would comp my lettuce wrap order because of their mistake.  Well I just picked up another order which included lettuce wraps and the employee told me it was comped but I pointed out the amount was still on the bill.  She was nice but couldnt figure out their system.  So here comes the manager (Morgan) asking all sorts of questions.  Long story short Morgan said she wouldnt waive the $12 because they dont have record of the error (and that she is the ONLY manager at that location...really?). She said ""when they make mistakes that she sends out a gift card and she would never offer a future credit."" She was very arrogant and rather rude and I really didnt see any benefit in arguing with her about $12.  I simply informed Morgan of my disappointment in both of my last visits but that waiving this amount (as I was originally promised) would only benefit her employee; the $9 left on my $100 gift card along with the $12 credit would mean a $21 tip for her employee. She still refused.  I asked her, so you would rather stay firm with that decision and have your employee not get a tip at all or you could waive the $12 as promised and let your employee have it...... a $21 tip on an $91 ""to go"" order?  She said ""sorry, I won't waive it."" What kind of manager would do that to her employee??  The avg 3 star yelp rating of this restaurant is deserved.  I feel bad for that employee.",92008

I've been many times to the Fashion Valley and La Jolla locations, always consistent, good food and an enjoyable experience. We called ahead to ask about the wait and if we could put in our name for a reservation. We were about 20 minutes out. I was advised that you must place your reservation one hour in advance and must be present when placing your reservation, you can't request one over the phone.Okay, a bit strange to me but no biggie.We arrived, put down our name for a table and headed to the bar.It wasn't long before we found a spot at the bar. We each ordered a drink and cashed out our bar tab. The hostess knew we were at the bar and came to escort us to our table when it was ready.This was all great and what we would expect, a good experience so far.We were seated and our server came by to greet us and take our order. We ordered the tofu lettuce wraps and two cups of soup. Still going well, these came out some time later and we ordered an entree, the salmon. Our salmon came out a bit later however we never saw our server again. We shared the salmon dish. We didn't finish it and both looked at each other and said, that was disappointing. We laughed about t and discussed what we thought about the salmon. It was dry, we each had the same thought with the first bite, was the spinach washed? Why was it so gritty and crunchy like there was dirt on the spinach, it certainly wasn't pepper. Finally another server came to our table and we asked for the check and asked if she was our server now and she said yes. I did mention that the soup and the tofu wraps were excellent but why would the salmon be so gritty and shared our discussion. She left and came back and said that she spoke with the chef and he assured her the produce was washed. We told her we weren't complaining or asking for anything to be taken off the bill, which is wasn't, we had just wanted to know if this was how it was supposed to taste. We didn't finish the salmon, it was awful. The tofu wraps were delicious as was the egg drop soup. In talking with friends I've learned that they have had similar experiences with the Carlsbad location only and they love any other location they've visited.This review is based on the experience we had in Carlsbad.We will most likely return to P.F.

Changs back in the day but now that there is one just a few miles from the house, we are just barely now getting around to dine at this Carlsbad location. It only took what??? 6 or so years? ha!I honestly don't know what made us decide to come here after all these years but for whatever reason, we decided to stop in for dinner on a Thursday night. We were told a wait for a table would be 10-15 minutes but it ended up being much less. Maybe 5 minutes. No complaints here. We pretty much knew what we both wanted within minutes of sitting down; the chicken lettuce wraps, honey seared chicken and the mongolian beef. It wasn't long after our order was taken that our appetizers...and our dinners were delivered to our table. The lettuce wraps had a mushy texture that I didn't remember them having leaving my hubby and I terribly disappointed. We were looking forward to these most and we left much of it remaining on the platter. The honey seared chicken was tasty and was the saving grace of our meal because the mongolian beef was EXTREMELY salty. I just could not eat more than a bite or two. And neither could my husband. We have a bad habit of not sending food back when we don't like it so both dishes were nearly untouched and sitting on the table. Our waiter noticed the remaining food and didn't even ask if there was a problem with the meal which was a bit surprising. If a couple orders an appetizers and two entrees and only one entree seemed to be consumed...something might've gone wrong. Maybe? ; {   We didn't request the food to be boxed up which should've been another red flag for our waiter but once again...over his head.

I also used to help train new employees for this chain restaurant. This particular restaurant is a disaster & needs serious help. Waiting 6 mins to have someone say they'll be right back & then another 8 until we get water. Really? Then, we get the appetizer with the entree & I have to ask for the condiment tray. Finally, they refill the ice teas when they drop the check. What a tragic excuse for a PF Chang's! (The food was mediocre at best.)",92008
2114,"5621 Paseo Del Norte Carlsbad, CA 92008",Amber M.,"Pooler, GA",10/17/2019,1,"Unfortunately I ordered from this restaurant through DoorDash tonight since I'm stuck in a hotel on a business trip with no easy access to food. I've enjoyed eating at P.F. Chang's for years all over the country but this was the worst experience I've had both in food quality, safety and management response I've had. After waiting an hour for food and being really hungry, when it arrived, it was prepared without all the ingredients we ordered and the meat was so dried and dehydrated that it was actually crunchy and completely inedible. The noodles were in a mushy clump. It was barely warm and almost looked like when you leave fresh Chinese food out overnight and it's all dried and tough like leather. I called the restaurant and spoke with a manager right away because it did not appear safe to eat. I asked him to replace our food and address how something like this could happen but he immediately shut me down, without a single apology, and said it wasn't their problem to fix because we didn't order direct from them. I understand that we went through a vendor but I didn't know they offered that but regardless, they were paid by the vendor and they made the error, not DoorDash. If they had good customer service, they would've replaced THEIR error and taken a loss on their own delivery driver to make it right and I'd think they'd want to have the food back to see how bad it was and manage poor performing cooks. So, we're still starving so I call DoorDash and they reorder the food for us and wait another hour. The food comes out still extremely overdone and missing the exact same ingredients but some parts were edible like the noodles and a couple pieces of chicken. And the manager still doesn't care. I guess I'll have to find a new Chinese restaurant. ‍‍ Now I still have to wait 2-3 business days for DoorDash to do anything for me.",92008

The manager on duty was so courteous and understanding. He had all the dishes remade and they were perfect. Our dynamite shrimp had a nice crunch and the sauce was a smoky chipotle.

I did have low expectations because I heard it kinda lost its luster way back in the day. However, I was actually pleasantly surprised. My friend and I had drinks at the bar while we waited for our table. We had a cucumber drink and a gin one, I completely forgot the names but both were refreshing and hit the spot. They were light and gave us a small buzz. However, the bartender was this young guy that didn't acknowledge us at first which was rude and he looked like he didn't want to be there. Once we sat down we ordered the lettuce wraps which are always a favorite and never disappoints - beware of the sauce! It's spicy! Then we had the steamed shrimp dumplings which was actually our favorite dish of the night. They were perfect! Don't let the red flake oil sauce fool you, it wasn't spicy. For our main entrees we had the honey crispy chicken which was bomb! Then we had the veggie fried rice which was bland but not bad. I appreciate not having it packed with sodium! Overall pretty decent meal and our waitress was very sweet too! The one thing that did bug us a tad is when they texted us that our table was ready, we were just closing our tab at the bar and they totally gave our table away right in front of us! That sat us down about a min later but come on, don't do that. I will probably come back if the occasion called for it.",92008

Changs in La Jolla and I've been to this one a handful of times but the prices are getting out of control for GF food. My son and I went tonight. He and I both got chicken Pad Thai. It was tasty but at my local Thai place it's usually $10 Max and all I have to do is ask them to make it GF. There is no up charge at the local thai place. At P.F. Changs everything on the GF menu was $2 more than the regular menu. I asked our server why and she said the GF sauces cost more. Huh? So 2 table spoons of tamari cost $2 more than regular soy sauce? Please.It comes with chicken, I requested the combo (chicken plus shrimp). I got 4 small shrimp and it was a $3 up charge. I'm okay with paying more, but $3 for 4 small shrimp?Also requested they add broccoli, she said it would be extra, which I figured. Local thai place charges me $1 and I get a nice portion of broccoli. At P.F they charged $1.50 and I got about 5 small to medium flowers. Seriously, it was about $0.15 worth of broccoli. My serving was like the scraps you throw away when you're trimming the big head of broccoli from the marketI mean really. I'm already paying extra for the GF and extra for shrimp, you'd think they could throw in a few piece of broccoli. My GF Pad Thai dish came to $22.00 which I think is insane. The regular price for my son's Pad Thai was $13.95 which is about $4 - $5 more than a local thai place which you'd expect from P.F. Chang's. The food was good.  The decor is nice and the rent is high. I get it. But to make the GF version $15.95 and then ding me another $5 for a few shrimp and a couple pieces of broccoli when there are dozens of other restaurant choices it's just bad business management.Won't be going back anytime soon. I can feed my entire family at the local thai place for what it cost for 2 of us here.",92008

Our time together. 2. The lemons that we asked for our waters were sliced thick so we were able to squeeze the lemon into our water. 3. The the lettuce for the chicken lettuce wraps were fresh and crisp. And the chicken that came with crisp lettuce was delicious, which I agree, it was. 4. The fried rice, was good as well. Here is where I believe P.F. Chang's could improve. I felt that our food was luke warm at best and not super freash. The chicken in their fried rice was breaded, cold, and it did not taste good at all. I ate around the chicken in that dish. In the chicken lettuce wraps, there were too many water chestnuts in my opinion. The flavor was good, just again not hot enough coming out. I don't want my meal to be cold before I'm done eating my plate. With everything that I've heard about P. F. Chang's, my exception was higher than the quality.

I wish I would've looked before even drove in here in this really expensive town and a beautiful shopping mall. Two weeks before Christmas and tonight this place is empty and now I know why. This was by far some of the worst service and food standards have I ever seen in my opinion for a well-respected chain. This Place is literally empty for dinner, and on a Monday night that would seem reasonable if it wasn't for PF Changs. The filthy tables, the inept service and honestly if you cannot see in these pictures, the garnish they use on the pad Thai is literally two or three days old and dry mealy carrots and green onion.  I'm honestly surprised that as great of company as this is - that I've eaten at numerous times in numerous states - this pathetic attempt of standards actually doesn't have the corporate offices down here revamping the entire place.  If the pictures don't do justice, look under the tables because that's how the bussers left them after they reset the tables wiping down with a dirty rag. Every table. The booth seats are not wiped down and there's garbage underneath the table and not just that table - literally every table. I can't even make this up, that I'm sitting a PF Changs and this is the way it's managed. Imagine dropping $100 for dinner and sliding in to a filthy soy sauce food stained seat. At P.F. Chang's? The managers at seem to care less about what happened with the lack of service and the lack of quality.  When have you ever seen PF Chang's leave their wood trays and tables set up in the dining room with dirty dishes piled on them.  Well they got my money and with just a simple ""sorry"" from the uncaring manager at the desk - I was out the door so they can get some other victim in there. I shot a picture of the operating partner who seriously have to look at these yelp reviews knowing they may have the lowest PF Changs yelp review in the entire nation, and this is in Carlsbad by the beach in Southern California.  PF Chang's I now know are not created the same and this is the first time I've ever seen this iconic chain with such horrible staffing and management.  Here's the guys card to talk to and I could care less because you could not fix this location until they shut down. In Carlsbad. Wealthy Carlsbad. Three stars. PF Changs.  I'm serious - look at it three stars. PF Chang's.It's unbelievable some of the yelp reviews from the last even two weeks absolutely mirror how horrible this place is and it absolutely does not reflect P.F. Chang's any other state or city. They have a huge problem from the top down. Watch them reach out with a canned response to call guest services so they can make it right. Make it right by taking it off the American express card.  How many times and how many people need to report how bad this place is and yet I may never go to another one because I thought they were all were extremely well ran. I'll be the fool once but I won't be twice.My review is not a one off run to yelp because I'm pissed off. It's only my opinion but this is PF Changs and they have standards and I'm willing to pay for those standards so long as they get off three star reviews from 400 people.

Both were delicious and enough food to feed three people.For dessert we each had one of their wonton desert options. Now these are tiny little thing but really yummy and after all the food we ate was just good enough taste that I didn't have to lay down under my table and take a nap.The drinks are always the business here.

It's not bad, but it's not the best Asian food out there. There are a few things on the menu though that are really great! My favorite are the Crab Wontons because they're crunchy and warm, and the sweet chili dipping sauce is perfect along with the julienned styled cucumbers and carrots next to it. I promise you I could order two orders of it and not have dinner. The Dan Dan noodles are the best noodles there! That Garlic sauce that's slathered over those noodles is on point! My favorite dinner entree was the Mahi Mahi with the cilantro lemon butter rice! I can't even tell you how amazing it was! This dish was the reason why I have become such an advocate of Mahi Mahi and even tried to recreate the fish at home which was ok, but not PF Chang fabulous! However my least favorite dishes were the lettuce wraps as starters. The sauce that's on them has too much soy sauce or something on it and overwhelms everything else in the platter. I really wanted to like it because it looked delicious. Also the Lo Mein isn't that great tasting. I would have the Dan Dan noodles over them anyday! The flour less Chocolate Dome was ok. Ironically slightly lacked chocolate flavor, but the raspberry sauce they use to decorate the plate with was amazing! I wish they had slathered it all over it! One of the perks I love is you can order online and pick it up! Especially for someone who's on a time crunch of 30 minutes, I have to use every minute to the max and I don't like having to eat in a hurry!Customer service is a hit or miss. Sometimes it's really fabulous and other times it's so so which is partial reason for the 3 stars. Plus they got rid of my favorite on the menu! That was quintessential for me!

The atmosphere is nice - comfortable booths, nicely decorated, and I have always found the service to be very good. However, the food can be inconsistent, so I hesitate taking guests here. We usually get the large wonton soup, and sometimes it has only 4 wontons, and other times it has 6 (?). Sometimes the soup bowl is full, and other times it is only 1/3 full. These are the things you notice when you're a regular. It's the same with the mongolian beef, or beef and broccoli: the quality of the beef is inconsistent. Sometimes it's tender and other times chewy and tough to the point that I really don't even want to eat it. The chicken lettuce wraps are excellent, but again, we they serve a variable amount of chicken, and even lettuce pieces.

My friend at the same table ordered surf and turf and his shrimp also came out breaded (almost tempura style), again not on the menu that it is breaded.

When we placed our food order we also placed an order for one entree to go. The waiter said he would put it in later toward the end of the meal. He obviously forgot and we sat there waiting for an extra 20 minutes after paying the check not to mention my two 6 year old kids were with me and were ready to go.

Cmon. After getting home we found half our meals were cold from the waiting, and they had forgotten rice for all the entrees ordered. To their credit, they offered us a gift card after I called and spoke to the mgr. But I'm far less inclined to continue going. It seems the service continues to wane.

It practically doesn't mean anything just another fancy name for a small restaurant, but it's so cute and classy. Speaking of which, their name totally reflects their food. Went here for lunch with a few coworkers and their dishes were dainty and delicious. Who knew Chinese food could be so sophisticated. This place pretty much takes the same items as Panda Express and Pick Up Stix and elevate it to another level with their finesse. I am pretty much a flaming hot spicy junkie so everything I order must at least guarantee a 1st degree burn to the normal palate.  Three dishes met my expectations. The Flaming Red Wontons - pork wontons in a spicy garlic and sesame soy sauce finished with scallions. Chang's Spicy Chicken - tender, diced chicken breast lightly dusted and stir-fried with a tangy sauce of sweet and spice. Personal key to Chinese food is order the item that takes the most technique and prep work since I'll definitely be too lazy to do it at home. Wontons fit that requirement. And second order proteins with the hardest sauce to replicate. Signature spicy, sweet and sour sauces are usually the most complicated and the tastiest so it's definitely worth the money.Must definitely come back here for their desserts. The Great Wall of Chocolate - six rich layers of frosted chocolate cake topped with semi-sweet chocolate chips, served with fresh berries and raspberry sauce. Blueberry Cheesecake - white chocolate cheesecake with swirls of fresh blueberries on a graham cracker crust served with a vanilla crème sauce and fresh mint. Tiramisu - mascarpone cream layered with espresso and brandy-soaked lady fingers, topped with imported sweet cocoa. My motto is only order desserts that I can't easily make at home or ones with a funny name.  If I were to base it on my favorite sweets I'd be ordering the entire menu.",92008

The rice portions are decent, but everything else is small and does not taste like Chinese food. We also ordered pad Thai. BIG mistake. HUGE! It did not taste like pad Thai, the noodles were gooey and the dish had similar taste to Kung Lao chicken. I think they use the same sauce, just added more lemon.

The restaurant was pretty empty but we decided to sit at the bar top since it was happy hour. About 15 minutes after we sat down, a woman comes up and sits directly next to me. She seemed totally fine so we just went on with our business. About 20 minutes later, the woman started engaging me in a friendly, albeit weird, conversation about her dating life. She started asking my S.O. weird questions about our relationship, personal questions (names, where we are from, etc.) I start to feel a little uncomfortable with the things she is saying, but I didn't make mention of it.Not soon after that, she began physically touching my arm, chest, and hair, as well as my S.O.'s arm and back. She was rubbing on me and him, and we started to get very uncomfortable. At this point the bartenders notice and immediately stopped serving her and she cashed out her tab. Around 6 o clock, I realize she is looking like she's going to be ill so I step away from the bar, and the bartender came around to escort the woman out. Then she gets up and she goes into the bathroom and vomits on the floor and LEAVES as they are calling 911! We think she may have been drinking beforehand or taken some kind of pill, because she was only served 2 drinks and seemed absolutely fine at her arrival.I have worked in restaurants off and on and I know people can act wild, so I had NO problems with the restaurant... it was not their fault, I would not have dreamed of complaining, and the staff handled everything impeccably. After everything, a man that worked there (either Manager or GM possibly, I unfortunately missed his name and title) came up and apologized to us! I was shocked because the restaurant had no fault in the scenario.

This place has always been hit and miss, but recently it seems to be missing most of the time. I know, I shouldn't expect much from a chain restaurant, but in the past PF Chang's has always been one of the more consistent, quality chains. Not so anymore, it appears. Here are just a few:The lettuce wraps no longer come with a custom sauce mixed by the waiter. Now a medium sauce arrives right on your plate in a little plastic bowl. If you want it hotter you have to ask and wait. Rather than solid, reusable models, the chop sticks are now wood, disposable, and on the table in a bowl. (Just like fast food). It's like corporate is trying to save money at every turn and it surprising that they thought no one would notice. PF Chang's is quickly on it's way to becoming the El Torito of Chinese food. And then the service at the the Carlsbad restaurant (which has rarely been good) is getting worse. The lettuce wraps were delivered without any plates. We had to flag down a waiter and ask. Plus, they arrived about 10 minutes before the rest of the appetizers. After we had finished the appetizers we had to wait a full 20 minutes for the entrees. Then every single selection was brought to the table by a different person, including a guy dressed like a manager. Then our waiter suggested that we try something special, sold us on it, and then promptly forgot to bring it or that he ever even mentioned it. By that point we were no longer interested in reminding him. Funny how a bunch of little stuff, can add up to a ruined meal. The hosts at the front were, however, nice enough to say ""Thanks for coming"" as we were on our way out the front door. That's why I gave the second star.",92008

2196,"5621 Paseo Del Norte Carlsbad, CA 92008",Anita F.,"Carlsbad, CA",3/30/2019,2,I'm very surprise ordering to go they have you wait 45 more minutes for food. I call thinking I'm ordering at the same time as someone sitting down at table to eat. I would think they would serve to go orders in line with the rest. We don't take up a table and we pay the same price as others. We are less of a hassle taking the food and we are gone. But P.F. Chang's has us wait.... they make you feel like second hand and not welcome there. I will not get food to go unless I remember to order an hour in advance. Which is never....,92008

Thankfully they had childrens chairs and booster seats to choose from.Our waiter was super friendly and attentive. We started off with yhe pan seared pork dumplings. They were so flavorful and cooked just right. After the waiter helped me pick a dish since I was between two. I went with the honey seared chicken.. which was amazing. We also tried the lo mein which was as equally amazing. They have a kids menu which was great and my son finished everything on his plate.For dessert we tried the chocolate wall cake and it was to die for!

I had called in to see how long the wait was, and off bat she had said 1-1.5hrs (w/o knowing my party size) then upon arrival we were the only group in the waiting area while others were able to walk right in and be seated. I felt that the woman upfront had no regard as to how late it was nor how many children we had in our party. She didn't reassure us that after they clear a few tables we will be seated. When asked she continued to say that we will be sure seated at the time I put in a reservation (when I only put in a reservation because she had said the wait was 1-1.5hrs) exactly the same amount of time we would have to wait w/o a reservation. Ridiculous.",92008

I've had a PF Changs gift card for who knows how long so decided to get some take-out after the movies. Placed the order with no issues and with an estimated wait time of 35-40 minutes. After arriving at the restaurant I walk into straight chaos. People everywhere with no idea what they're doing, myself included, absolutely no structure while waiting to be helped by a hostess. See a ""Take-Out"" sign and go to it which is pretty much the bar next to a door where the staff goes in and out of trying to ignore you. After trying to flag someone down for a couple minutes (no help from the bartenders who didn't look my way once) I finally get a response I will be helped soon. Finally some girl comes up asking if I have a to-go order. She asks, aka, yells for my name from her POS system or computer or wherever, doesn't repeat back order correctly with modifications and also doesn't give back my gift card with the balance. Yes the balance was less than $1 but it's the principal they didn't give me back my ""change."" Food portions were small, Ginger Chicken definitely had ginger flavor and that's it. Veggie Lo-mein was typical lo-mein, could find it anywhere else, nothing too special. Sadly favorite part about this trip was the nice plastic containers my food came in. ",92008

We had the absolute pleasure of being waited on by the friendliest server I may have ever met. I wish I remembered his name because he truly helped create a wonderful dining experience. Managers, if you are reading this, I have to give props to this particular employee. He is a dad who does real estate on the side, and works at P.F. Chang's because he truly enjoys it.

After our last two visits here, it seems that PF Chang's has changed for the better!On this latest visit, we started off with a great server, Chelsea; Always friendly, helpful and communicative. The Mai-tai was so good this time (strong and flavorful) that we ordered more.As far as food, the rice was back to normal; good & moist & sticky. The crispy honey shrimp had big shrimps, and just as much as the chicken (previously you got fewer shrimp than the chicken dish, but paid more!).  And the Mongolian beef and spicy green beans were all cooked just right. Basically, everyone at the table liked everything on the table. No complaints. The only thing we all miss is the individual shot glass-sized desserts. But we shared the Great Wall of chocolate (cake), and loved it.Anyhow, I had to share because I have been bad-mouthing the Chang on surveys, and it seems that they have been listening.",92008

The service was a bit slow, I feel that the patio should have more than 1 server out there. The girl tried but as the more and more people came service fell short.

Nothing very special at all. I had the Orange Beef. It was okay, but again nothing special. You pay for the dim ambiance, swanky decor, and plating. Overall its okay, but the price and food quality doesn't warrant regular visits. Service was acceptable but not great. Server liked to hear himself talk and gaved me a warm glass for my Sulpin IPA, yet my glass of ice water was chilled. Got it backwards dude. Our waiter even commented how he like he loves craft beer. Apparently not.Was good to try PF but I'll be sticking to my local Great Wok in Oside. The food is BETTER for a 1/3 of the price. I might stop by here again in the future but probably to just hang at the bar and grab some appetizers.One last thing... the food goes through you. Both me and my date felt a little queasy post meal and the next day. Not horrible but its what I would expect from a fast food joint. Minus a star for that.",92008

2259,"5621 Paseo Del Norte Carlsbad, CA 92008",Caleb T.,"Encinitas, CA",3/3/2011,2,"This will be a very loppsided review, so bear that in mind...I come to this restaurant probably once every other season, so I'm not exactly their core demographic.  And I usually only come here because a friend would like to meet for lunch and this is their choice.  If I go for fake chinese food at a franchise place, I'd much rather eat at Chin Schezwan or even Pick-Up Stix.But that being said, I do very much enjoy P.F. Chang's Lettuce Wraps and have good experiences with their numerous shrimp dishes.  If I were writing a review on on those particular dishes and my forays into this place from years ago, that would warrant a 3 Star rating, at most.However, this review will be based on the two times I've been here this week.  First off, the reason I've come here twice in one week (when I've been here about six times in three years) is because I had a gift card and wanted to get rid of it.  Second, I've been on a major salad kick recently and thought this may be a nice change of pace after a gym workout, grabbing a P.F. Chang salad and heading home to enjoy it.Now, there are those of you out there who would say that you don't go to a Chinese Restaurant for salad, and you'd be right in saying so (you go to Vietnamese place to get yourself a Bo Tai Chanh, if you know what I mean ... and I think some of you do).  Still, I braved the odds and found that P.F. Chang's has two salad choices on their menu.  I tried both.The Chicken Chopped Salad: When you go to a restaurant OTHER than a roadside diner or, say, Wendy's, you expect a salad, especially one of entree portions / quality to be of, well ... entree portion / quality!  This salad had a grand total of 3 ingredients in it.  Two of those ingredients came straight out of a plastic bag (the house greens and a smaller bag of baby greens) and topped with thinly sliced chicken that was grilled at least six hours prior and then tossed into the fridge for safe keeping.  The only saving grace for this was the dressing.If anyone from the head office that owns this franchise is reading this, if you're going to charge around $10 for a salad, it should have more to it than a $5 one you can get over at Jack-in-the-Box.  And for god's sake, how difficult is it to grill a chicken breast to order?  Not often you should be ashamed of a menu item, but this restaurant really should pull this off their selection.I actually went back and complained to the manager about it.  John, very nice guy, I wasn't trying to be belligerent or anything, but I wanted to let him know the depths of shame that eating that salad left me in and he agreed.  To make up for it, he nodded and said that the salad I walked off with that evening should make up for it...Asian Shrimp Salad: Now this salad was interesting.  Definitely more to it this time around with at least eight different ingredients going for it and an actual freshly cooked protien atop it.  The citrus dressing definitely complimented the melon and shrimp, adding a nice acid bite to the sweet and char that dominated the rest of the salad.  And I do applaud P.F. Changs for actually opening three plastic bags instead of two to make up the entree's base.While this salad was a definite improvement over the first, it still only brings up the average of this review to a two.  And again, remember that this review is based solely on their salads, which I wouldn't expect anyone else to come here for.  If your choice of fare is the lettuce wraps and glazed ... whatever protien you want covered in sugary sauce before fried .. then this place is easily a three star and a good place to have drinks with your co-workers on a Wednesday night.",92008

I was place on hold for FIVE MINUTES and 49 seconds and when the last finally picked up the phone (I believe her name was Andrea) she sounded miserable and was very short with me.It was disappointing to have this experience because I absolutely love this place but the customer service tonight was appalling.

The food is sooo Americanized and impossible to eat. Everything tasted like it was pre-frozen. Also our waiter was terrible and very inattentive, disappearing for long periods of time. It made the experience awkward because everyone at our table needed something. Took him like 10 minutes to get my change so I'm literally sitting there twirling my hair... that cost your tip buddy. You could tell the wait staff don't take their jobs seriously. I had to ask a girl where my waiter was with my change and she gave me this weird look like ""why are you asking me?"" Cause you work here ya big dummy. Here's what we ordered:Hot & Sour soup - you might as well call it Vinegar soup. It was soo sour and every person at our table complained about how difficult it was to eat. No one finished their bowl and the rest went to waste.The lettuce chicken wraps - they gave us 4 tiny pieces of lettuce for 6 people to share. Um, can you math at all??The green beans - covered in a thick sauce of who knows what, very soggy, way too salty.The dan dan noodles - they're not on the menu anymore and now I see why. The sauce was super starchy and the noodles were overcooked so they were just mushy in your mouth. The taste wasn't right either. We ate around 2pm. I was burping and my stomach felt weird all day. Around 8pm my stomach had not digested anything from PF Chang's and I threw up the entire lunch.VERDICT: Horrible service topped with indigestible food. Awful experience overall, waste of time and money. You're much better off going to Panda Express for food and value.",92008
2263,"5621 Paseo Del Norte Carlsbad, CA 92008",Robert P.,"Encinitas, CA",4/5/2014,4,"Maybe it's just because our expectations were set so low based on the other reviews, but we actually had a stellar experience aside from contending with a glacially slow kitchen which our server apologized for throughout the meal.Let me start off by saying that OF COURSE PF Chang's is *NOT* authentic Chinese food.  Why would we even want it to be?!!  It boggles my mind to no end that so many reviews make it out like this is a bad thing?  I have been to China and eaten authentic Chinese food and I have to say that I doubt it would ever be very popular in the US.  My experience with China has always involved many mystery meats and lots of bones--you're getting short changed over there if you don't get bones because they expect you to want to suck out the marrow.  While there may be a few ""authentic"" Chinese restaurants to be found in the international districts of some of the larger US cities, I would argue that pretty much ANY Chinese food you find in the States is *NOT* authentic.With that being said, you can be sure that the kitchen at PF Chang's is clean and their meats and ingredients are of a high degree of quality, something you definitely are not assured of at either an authentic or a more Americanized Chinese restaurant.  Also, yes it's true that their food may contain a lot of sugar and fat, but I fail to see how this is any different from the food served at the majority of Chinese American restaurants.  What am I missing here?Overall PF Chang's in Carlsbad has great food, excellent presentation, elegant ambiance, and attentive service.  The price point is not so great, it's a VERY slow kitchen, and yes it's not the most ""authentic"" Chinese dining experience, but then again what truly is here in the US?  Most of us are just fine without it!The presentation of the food is also excellent as well.",92008

Paired well with my food. -Hot and Soup Soup: If you're not into Hot and Sour, it may taste a bit odd to you. I don't prefer H&S soup in Chinese places. -Egg Drop Soup: Bland but OK. -Chang's Chicken Lettuce Wraps: Refreshing! Like that our waitress even gave us extra lettuce for the leftover chicken! -Crab Wontons: OK, nothing special. -Mongolian Beef: Too much green onion, but the beef was good. -Sweet and Soup Pork: Good but the pieces were small. Not as crunchy as I would have wanted them to be. -Honey Shrimp: OK - probably one of the better dishes of the night. -Orange Peel Chicken: Had a very distinctive flavor that we didn't like too much. Had a kick to it also, which we weren't a fan of. -Double Pan-Fried Noodles: Talk about SALTY!!! -Lo-Mein Combo: Ehhh, it was ok.... -Tiramisu: Good if you like mocha/choco flavor. -Apple Pie: Tastes like a frozen apple pie!!! Perhaps it's better warmed up - like a real apple pie??? -Lemon Tart: Very TART!!! YE-OW!!! -Strawberry Cheesecake: Prob the best one - graham crumbled crust - crunchy!!! This place gets packed, so luckily we had reservations for our large party. Otherwise you could be stuck waiting an hour or more!!! Parking could be crazy, and they don't offer valet. Overall, we had a great time. Total bill came out to $140, which is a STEAL. Our waitress was super nice and friendly, which did help out with the extra half star.

I won't mention the waiters name because I don't want to embarrass him. He was very nice but he was clearly very young and inexperienced. He waited to bring out our two glasses of wine almost 15min after we order them as we watched him walk passed them at the bar several times. We watched all waiters and even the MANAGER giving the wrong plates to wrong tables. If the manager is clueless than that tells you everything. They all look so disoriented and confused. The place is a mess. The only people who were helpful were the two girl hostesses. We had to even ask the hostess to bring us our two dinner plates and sirahcha as my gf had to patient wait for it for almost 15 min again because our waiter forgot them for a very long time. (We were patient and didn't complain once, I saved it for the review). A guest should never have to get up and get their own stuff. RIDICULOUS! The manager (some bald guy) is a complete moron!

I came here for Happy Hour with a friend.$6 items:Northern Style Spare ribs - While I liked the fact it was moist on the inside, the exterior was a bit tough to get through. Additionally, these are ribs are dry, which means don't expect some sort of bbq sauce to be slathered all over it. In fact, they give you a dry rub for dipping (not enough). Its a mixture of star anise, cinnamon and other spices. Seared Ahi Tuna Salad - Sliced very thin and not many. Seems typical no?PF-X - We weren't warned that this was a pink drink. I'm surprised my friend held his embarrassment of having one pretty well (as he isn't the type to drink a ""girly"" drink). It's actually not that bad given the fact it has a bit of sprite in it. Maybe one should ask for it in a dark glass?Asian Pear Mojito - this wasn't bad, the only thing I found a bit off was the fact that the mint was ground to so many little pieces that I found it a bit unpleasant when I happen to swallow pieces of the mint.$5 items:Salt & Pepper Calamari - although i didn't quite care for the breading in the calamari... it was in fact tasteless and needed seasoning after it was out of the fryer. The dipping sauce is surprisingly pleasant and great with rice!Chang's Chicken Lettuce Wraps - this is their staple item and my first trying it. While I definitely felt it needed more lettuce, it wasn't bad at all. I enjoyed the textures and flavors from the chicken. Unfortunately though, I found the water left in the lettuce from its wash tended to water down the flavors from the chicken. I found myself dabbing and trying to ""dry-out"" the lettuce leaf.The service, however, was excellent. Our waitress, Alena, was very informative and helpful with all of our requests.

2277,"5621 Paseo Del Norte Carlsbad, CA 92008",Robert H.,"Denver, CO",12/21/2010,4,"To truly understand the appeal of P.F. Chang's China Bistro you have to think American dining experience x Asian cuisine. The interior decoration and food combination will beat that of any other chain restaurants but remember it is still just that, a chain. I agree with Socrates philosophy that worthless people live only to eat and drink; people of worth eat and drink only to live. At P.F. Chang's China Bistro you can try a variety of Americanized Chinese dishes at a decent price with friends and/or family. My bill for two people has been as low as $20 and high as $40 on various visits.- Wide food selection.- Cheap eats available.- Mostly attentive service.- Roomy Layout.- Intriguing interior decoration.- Good for groups.== SERVICE ==As you arrive at the entrance you walk past an 11-foot tall, 750-pound horse. The majestic horse, which has become an icon for the restaurant, stands guard over the entrance. More symbolic statues and decorations are located inside that symbolize the Forbidden City in China.After a small wait (assuming you called ahead) you can either sit at a small table inside or nice heated seating outside (my favorite). The waiters outside tend to have less customers and seem to pay more attention to you, or at least this has been my experience.== FOOD ==On your first visit you have to try the chicken lettuce wraps that are quickly-cooked spiced chicken served with cool lettuce cups (vegetarian available). This magical combination of hot and cool with the oils and spices will tantalize your taste buds. I was very unsure at first, but haven't regretted the decision since.If you're on a budget than head to the noodles/rice section of the menu. You can order a HUGE bowl of beef/chicken/shrimp noodles or rice prepared various ways for around $10. This will be enough to satisfy the average appetite. My favorites are the Singapore street noodles or lo mein.When visiting with a significant other, give the  ""P.F. Chang's For Two"" a try. Enjoy a four-course meal for two for $40. This has been a huge favorite for my wife and I as you can save around $15 with the right food selection.",92008

Next time my friends & I decide to go shopping at the outlets this will be our lunch destination.",92008
2281,"5621 Paseo Del Norte Carlsbad, CA 92008",Banu S.,"San Diego, CA",5/22/2011,4,"We went here for my nephew's birthday celebration, with around 13 others. We were seated outdoors with reservations. It was initially cold, but the heaters and drawing the blinds quickly made it toasty.We started with the lettuce wraps, simple and fun. Not the most innovative or amazing, but it does the trick. The kids loved it too.Loved that they had a gluten free portion of the menu, big plus in my book.  We ordered the Singapore noodles from there, and the rest from the regular menu. How amazing and delish the Singapore noodles were. The whole table wanted more. It was filled with itty bitty rice noodles and lots of veggies. Simply the best.We ordered Kung Pao Shrimp, Beef Broccoli, and Honey Chicken, and the Vegetable Tofu, all very good. The food always is good here, even if it is commercialized. The service was quick and attentive.The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that they never made us the dipping sauces that they usually do when they come by. Not sure if it was because we had such large party, but that was a little disappointing.Overall, good food, good location, not busy like La Jolla. But La Jolla definitely has a bigger restaurant with a more gorgeous ambiance....",92008
2282,"5621 Paseo Del Norte Carlsbad, CA 92008",Nanci S.,"San Fernando, CA",3/24/2018,1,Horrible! I ordered take out and they gave me a pick up time of 8:50 40 min after I ordered. My husband went 15 min late and they still did not have my order ready and waited a extra 20 min! What is the point of giving a pick up time??? Plus it was probably the worst chinese food I have ever had! I wanted to speak to a manager and waited 20 min on the phone and no one ever answered. I will be calling corporate. We will never go back!,92008
2283,"5621 Paseo Del Norte Carlsbad, CA 92008",Liz E.,"Mission Viejo, CA",5/2/2013,3,"Here's a confession, we've been going here for at least three years now and we used to go weekly that the bartenders knew us as regulars. They even knew what our usual orders were. The bartenders are usually awesome and I have no complaints about their service. They're friendly, attentive, and do a great job overall. Sometimes it could get busy during dinner time around 6pm to 8pm (avoid these hours if you can) but the maximum bartenders I've seen working per shift is two bartenders and an occasional bar back. Given that, they still do a really great job of making sure we have our drinks, food, and keep us happy. They at least acknowledge us if they can't get to us right away (and we can see why, they're providing for about 15 people at the bar and the rest of the restaurant's drinks). We eat dinner at the bar because there's usually no wait if there's an open seat and even if the bar was packed full, the wait is usually much shorter than for a table. Plus, we're right in front of the TVs which have sports on.The food is a little above average and probably better than the Chinese restaurant near our home that I gave a 5 star review. Then again, that 5 star Chinese restaurant has great authentic Chinese food (the war wanton specifically) but they also serve Italian food -- and that's why PF Chang's is better -- because at least PF Chang's is ""Asian Fusion"". ""Chinese-Italian food"" just doesn't sound right. But I digress....The food is obviously Americanized. Most people would describe PF Chang's as Asian Fusion. That's a fancy word for ""It's not really Chinese or Japanese or Thai buuuut it's Chinese/Asian/Japanese themed"". But I like it, my fiance LOVES it (he's super vanilla), and my Asian family loves it too (but they'll eat anything fried, sweet, or greasy). I'm gonna be honest, it's very similar to Pei Wei (which is PF Chang's fast food, so yeah) and a little better than Pick Up Stix and Panda Express.We've sat down for a table a few times before. We weren't all that impressed with our service. We kept wondering where our server was because it wasn't that busy (that's why we got a table) and we haven't seen them come out from the kitchen in a while. Food took awhile to get to us (again, much better service at the bar area). I think the worst experience in a restaurant, besides rude staff, is having an empty glass while dying of thirst -- especially when you're eating something spicy. But to credit other PF Chang's, we did have better service in other locations in San Diego.I also felt compelled to write this review because after being a regular for years, I've noticed that whoever the hostess is (they don't seem to last long in this position), they usually act like they don't see me (I could be standing right in front of them, less than a foot away and still nothing, I'm 5'3"" just fyi) or even acknowledge me when I walk in with my fiancee. They usually only make eye contact with him or talk to him and greet him. One time, I actually had to tap the podium/desk to interrupt a hostess and her fellow hostess' seemingly unending mindless chatter so one of them can put us down for a table or seat us. Is this a requirement for every hostess here-- Avoid eye contact or communication with female patrons who are with their significant others?  I've thought twice about mentioning this in my review but it has happened ALL the time that I'm now finding it rude and extremely annoying. I don't want to be a b!tch to anyone in the service industry (because I used to be a server too and understand what they go through) but just what the eff is up with your hosts? Can you teach them some basic manners before putting them out there, pretty please? I spend a crap ton of money here (yes, I choose to pay for our dinner half the time) and it would be nice if I wasn't treated like Medusa by your restaurant hostess. Besides, can't turn someone already that cold into stone.You know what ruins good food? Or in this case, just average food... Bad service and/or incompetent staff.",92008
2284,"5621 Paseo Del Norte Carlsbad, CA 92008",Dee A.,"Carlsbad, CA",5/4/2018,2,Not sure if it's due to new cooks in the back but my last order of take out was horrible. My chicken lo mein was dry and the noodles all stuck together. The order of beef and broccoli also needed to be cooked a little longer. Always been a fan of this place since they opened but now things have really gone downhill there. Hope they can redeem themselves if I decide to return. The two stars is for the nice waitress behind the bar who took my payment lol. For any tourists looking for a cool spot next to the flower fields head over to Ruby's across the street!!!,92008

The sushi roll was a bit dull, but everything else was wonderful! Great atmosphere friendly and attentive service, and with only a $10 corkage fee, you can't beat it!

The pretty hostesses wouldn't accept our bribes so we really had to wait the 35 minutes (good hostesses). The appetizers came out quickly! Our server was kind but inexperienced and ended up spilling an iced tea all over my friend's phone and lap. There were several mistakes with our order... My ""orange peel beef"" came out as orange chicken. The ""chicken lettuce wraps"" had no chicken. The same friend that had tea spilled on him ordered a non spicy dish that came out vey spicy. The soup and tea that we hoped would be hot because it's cold outside, were luke warm when we received them. I've been to this particular PF Changs many times and was hoping to give it a good rating based on passed experiences. But because of the horror that just took place I cannot pretend that it is deserved. The food is delicious now doubt! They ended up discounting my friends meal, but what an insult after ruining such a potentially enjoyable evening. Shout out to management being very professional! I'm counting on our next experience here being better! Stay posted!",92008

So we had a late lunch on a Friday afternoon.  Walked in to a darkened dining room (guess they don't want people to know it's daytime so maybe they'll think it's dinner and spend more...) and we ordered a lunch special.Lunch specials include a starter soup, main course, and rice.  It was actually a substantial portion size and very filling. I had the almond cashew chicken and my friend the spicy chicken.  Both were tasty, but nothing to write home about.The restaurant was filled with corporate folks who were enjoying entrees and downing glasses of wine at 3pm. So it appeared that they came for the environment but not necessarily for the food. Our service was great- our waitress was extremely attentive.Would I go back?  Probably not for another 5 years like the last time.  Unless my friend drags me there... :-)",92008
2289,"5621 Paseo Del Norte Carlsbad, CA 92008",Heather M.,"Olympia, WA",4/7/2013,1,"The fact that this place is still around tells you how many people are out there who enjoy eating fake ""Americanized"" Chinese food. Maybe they just don't know any better?! I'd respect someone more if they headed to Panda Express as at least then they wouldn't be paying a ridiculous amount for a horrible riff on a classic Szechuan or Cantonese dish. I have many issues with this chain, the two biggest being:1. Their food. For the most part, it's disgusting. They take everything that's good about an authentic Chinese dish and throw it right out the window. They fry items that should be baked or steamed, they smother overly-processed proteins with high-calorie/high-sodium sauces, they leave out fresh vegetables, etc. I came here last week, at a friend's request, and almost walked out when I saw what their version of mapo tofu looked like. It consisted of deep-fried pieces of tofu (ew!), a tiny bit of sauce (which looked and tasted nothing like it should), and broccoli (WTF?!). 2. Their prices. To put it simply, they're ridiculous! They charge, on average, $4-$5 more per plate. Needless to say, last week was the LAST time I will dine at this chain. And I suggest you do the same! If you're in the mood for real Chinese food, check out the following restaurants: Chine Chef 2 in Mira Mesa, Spicy House in Clairemont, or Spicy City in Kearny Mesa. If you're in North County, you'd be better of heading over to one of the many Chins restaurants or Yenchim Garden in RP (just make sure to ask for the Chinese menu).",92008

Chang's offers Americanized ""Chinese"" food in an upscale-feel, modern restaurant, catering to those people who prefer standardized chain-restaurant flavor. When you only have an hour for lunch - and you want to switch things up from the same places you go for lunch every day (eg. NOZOMI & LOTUS THAI in Carlsbad Village) then you don't have that many options to choose from.P.F. Chang's is next door to BJ's and seated us very quickly.  Within 10 minutes we were snacking on Chicken Lettuce Wraps and the flavor didn't blow me away.  It was a little too greasy for my taste, and nothing about the flavorings of the chicken really impressed me. I know it's a P.F. Chang's favorite - and it was definitely fresh and interesting, but the flavor really didn't do much for me.This time I had the Honey Chicken Lunch dish on brown rice, and it was good.  The chicken tasted surprisingly fresh and tender.  With Americanized chinese food I'm used to chicken being overfried and almost gummy in texture, but if chicken could ever be described as light and airy - it was light and airy today.Service was good - attentive and fast. In and out in an hour! For dinner here, I have had the Vegetarian Eggplant dish which truly is very good.  However be warned that the eggplant dish, shockingly, really is ONLY eggplant.  Not even any onion garnishes or something!

A family of 4. We've been eating at this location on and off after they opened. We've eaten at many PF Chang's locations across the U.S. for 15 years or so. We walked through the door to find the hostess as well as most of the staff leaning against their area talking. The manager as another employee were in the bar leaning against a wall watching a game on TV. The men's room was dirty, the outside of the building was littered with trash. The front door handle was grimy.Really? After our won ton soup arrived, we requested some brown rice. It never came. I got up and went to the kitchen door where I stood looking for the guy. As other servers looked at me and walked by, I went into the kitchen and got my rice.We were the first and only customers. As other customer arrived, the hostess sat each one right around us. Even though there were other servers in other areas. The do this because it's easier for the server, to Hell with the comfort of the customer.This place is very poorly managed at best.

We both commented to our waitress that the soup had a strange chemical smell. We definitely should NOT have eaten it. I didn't even make it our of the restaurant before I experienced an explosive case of diarrhea. And my wife had a similar episode on the way home.

I really L-O-V-E their P. F. Chang's Oolong Marinated Sea BassIt is on a bed of spinach and marinated to perrrrrr-FECT-ion. Really it is and worth every nickel and dime I use to pay for it as I don't know how they do it and with what type of sea bass, but it makes my mouth water just typing about it. It is the best ""9 oz of nirvana sea food"" you can place in your mouth..Mm, Mm-hmn..It has F-L-A-V-O-R...I posted some pics tooBtw... I usually order this and maybe a beer with some brown rice and the waiter/waitress have been extremely helpful in pointing this out to me on my visits. In fact, I was very honest to the waitress at this location the first time I checked out Chang's telling her this wasn't my first choice (as my 1st place of choice across the street was extremely busy) so she then recommended the Marinated Sea Bass (after quizzing me on my likes and dislikes) and I have been hooked since then. She even told me that this is so popular that the staff has to wait for the entire customer's to order theirs before staff can have it.I would have given it 5 stars, but like I said I only go there for 1thing... but that one thing is 5stars IMHO",92008

Tokyo-chiq maybe, but slightly less gay than the Banana Republic khaki's you may or may not have purchased across the road.Every bit of our meal, was exactly as expected, and exactly as we'd remembered from countless visits to other locations on the left coast.

But that did not stop this from going downhill from there.  We did not see our waiter again for a good ten minutes. When we finally did see him he was dealing with a situation at another table that seemed to require the manager but there was not a manager in site.  He then came and asked if we were ready to order our whole meal....which we were but usually we at least get the drinks first. So we placed our whole meal-drinks, an appetizer, egg rolls, a soup, and an entree.  Then he disappeared again for at least another ten minutes.  Then we received our drinks from another waiter.  About two minutes after that, we got the rest of our food-all at the same time!  This wasn't really a problem though and we started to eat our appetizer- chicken lettuce wraps.  I have to say they were good and tasty but tasted as if they had been cooked previously and heated up. My husband's entree was edible but  not warm at all and also seemed not freshly cooked but something that was reheated.  The soup although hot, was not good.  I did not like the noodles, which I was okay with, I was just going to eat the chicken, veggies and the broth.  But when I bit into one piece of chicken, it was raw.  Needless to say I didn't eat any more of the soup.   I would have complained immediately but it seemed the entire staff was missing and there were not waiters on the floor at all. I could some of them standing around in the kitchen though.   We were not the only ones having issues.  There were people waiting for refills, their checks,  some kind of service..... Finally a few servers came out of the back and we were able to  to flag down someone to give us plates and water.  They did not stick around long enough for me to even mention the soup.   By this time we were just frustrated and  ready to leave and looking and  waiting for the server to ask for our check.  When he finally came, I did tell him about the raw chicken and he did take it off our bill.  But by that  time we just wanted to get out of there.  This was just a disappointment.  P.F. Chang's used to be so good at one time. I just don't know what has happened.  If we didn't have the gift certificate and had to pay for that meal, it would have been a disaster and I feel bad for the other patrons who were also experiencing bad service.  But it seemed like even getting the manager, who seemed to be an elusive person in the back of the restaurant, was not going to help this mess.",92008

2324,"5621 Paseo Del Norte Carlsbad, CA 92008",Abbys A.,"Loma Linda, CA",7/12/2012,3,"We came here for dinner after our Legoland trek.  We ordered from the kids menu for my toddler - My son specially liked the chicken Lo Mein and it's a steal for $2.99.  The steamed vegetables (kids menu) were dry and hard.  My toddler actually spit out the broccoli.  And he loves broccoli!  He did not eat his veggies at all (he loves veggies) and when I tasted it, I didn't like it either.  Sautéed spinach and garlic was not to my liking either.  I drowned it with soy sauce and hot sauce but I still could not finish it.  The vegetables we ordered were a waste.  Sadly, I tried to eat it but I just could not force myself to finish it.  The orange peel (Panda Express quality and taste) and lettuce wrap was mediocre at best.  Hostess here were very unfriendly and unorganized (they forgot about us) but I do not want to dwell on that.  So, let's move on to the good part - Our server was actually nice, she was extremely busy but manage to put full effort to please and serve us.  If she forgot something, she will come back right away and be straight forward about it.  We understand her shortcomings (late in filling our drinks and few more unworthy of mentioning) because it was really busy that night, plus, she was very pleasant and apologetic about it.  She was not even close to a perfect server but her positive attitude made up for it.  She is the reason why I added 1-2 stars for this restaurant; otherwise I would have rated this place a mere 1 star.  This restaurant is located by the Carlsbad outlet and close to Legoland so expect this place to be very crowded.  Overall, a very generous 2.5-3 stars rating from me.  I don't think I will be back here anytime soon though.",92008

Wife and I walked into the restaurant feeling a bit ""hangry"" but we're quickly seated and attended by our server, Thomas. He took our drink orders and asked if we wanted to start off with any appetizers, he informed us that the kitchen was a bit slow tonight.  So we went ahead and decided to put in our order of honey walnut shrimp (my favorite), mangolian beef(another of my favorites), and kong pow chicken (a bit spicy). The food was brought out quickly than we had expected. Thomas was very attentive!! He made sure we had a good time, good eats, and overall made our evening pleasurable. Thank you Thomas!

2327,"5621 Paseo Del Norte Carlsbad, CA 92008",Gerry B.,"Westminster, CA",7/17/2014,4,"We ate at the Carlsbad PF Chang's Bistro last weekend. We were there as soon as they opened as were others and they seemed a bit put off people were standing in line at the door to get in. If you open at 11, you should expect people to be waiting to get in. We were seated right away and ordered dumplings and crab rangoon for appetizers. The crab rangoons were ok but I have had better at our local restaurant in Garden Grove. The dumplings were tasty but again nothing special. The 2 teenagers with us all ordered chicken fried rice and they got huge portions of rice. It was tasty but not anything special again. My gf was pumped as they had a gluten free menu and she was excited to be able to eat chinese food again. She asked for fried rice only to be told it could not be ordered except during the lunch menu times during the week. Kind of weird, but she pressed the issue and the waitress very kindly went and asked the chef who agreed to make her some. Again, not sure what the big deal was. She then ordered the gf singapore street noodles w/ light curry sauce with thin rice noodles, sliced chicken breast, shrimp and fresh vegetables and it was a large portion but with much of their food, it is very sweet. I had the gf shaking beef tender flank steak, thinly sliced potatoes and broccoli, on fresh greens, tomatoes, and red onions, with zesty lime vinaigrette . The sauce was really really good and it was better compare to some. Overall, we had great service and while the portions are large for like the fried rice dishes, the food is bit overpriced, relatively good and I can usually get better from our local strip mall variety chinese places at home. Our service again was awesome, she really went out of her way to make sure we had a good experience. Will we ever go back YES this place is recommended to all to at least try once but for us we would like to try Chang's Specialties which was rave all over.",92008

The first time we ate dinner at the restaurant. All the plates were below average in taste, the mongolian beef had been reheated who knows how many times that it looked dry and burnt. I waited 2 years to try it out again, so I gave them the benefit of the doubt just to find out nothing had changed. This second time I ordered online, and called to make sure the plates were mild-not only my order took more than 30 minutes, I had to send back one of the plates because I had order without spicy, and they still had added lots of spicy. When we got home our lunch boxes had the rice  mixed up with the main dish, and it was pretty bad tasting, not to mention it had gotten cold already and I live 5 minutes from the restsurant. So, I figured for chinese food this is got to be worst PF Chang I have ever tried.",92008

No more chop stix at the table at an upscale Chinese restaurant?!?! WTH? When we had to, again, ask for it, it was brought in a Cuban cigar box like they were sooo important. Food was okay. Lettuce wrap was mostly nuts- BARELY any chicken. Daughters food was so hot and placed in front of her that my husband got a small blister from touching it.

I have never had a food allergy in my whole life, but I ordered the Honey Walnut Shrimp here, and here I am at my desk, broken out in hives.

The ambiance is very nice, our waiter was good but I gave it 4 stars because the food was not mind blowing. I plan to visit this place again to try some of their other dishes, I had  the almond & cashew chicken and I think I was hoping for more almonds & cashews, i dont even remember there being any in the dish come to think of it. I will say the salt & pepper calamari was very delicious though and so was the sauce it came with as well!!!!! We did a 2 meal + appetizer deal so the pricing was overall good too!Mans Perspective: We had the Dinner for two meal and I chose pepper steak for my entree....it was bangin!  the calamari and sauce was too good, I wanted to learn the recipe for it! I actually used the remaining sauce on my rice!  The look inside is real comfortable, makes you wanna relax.  The only thing I would like for them to change is the rice portions, they are toooo small!  For dessert, I had the Salted Caramel Cake and I have to say, I wanted at least 10 more.  As long as they keep providing A+ service, and food, I will always put them in my memory list of restaurants when I want to eat out.  Cant forget about the Sake, good stuff, I recommend it warm.  4.8 Stars...can I do that?",92008

One has to understand that this place is crowded most of the time and a reservation is defiantly called for. Even then you may have to wait A few minutes before being seated, and it one also has to observe the wait staff because some of them could be on their first day on the job.Most of the food is very good and compared to any Chinese food in the county it's heads over heels, but like any other hi capacity restaurant in Southern CA, the meals depends on workers who, at the drop of the hat, don't show up for work, leaving the patron suffering....Again my rating is based on all of the above and I also have been their 5 times with a decent time.",92008

I've had to wait both times for a table (and at the other locations as well) and I'm not sure how they seat people waiting so quickly. They don't rush you and I know I drag my ass getting out of there yet the wait is never long. Must be Ancient Chinese Secret.  Both times the hostess was friendly and actually AT the hostess stand when I arrived. When I was seated she smiled and was very friendly and professional.  Our server(s) were prompt, patient and explained the menu questions quite well to the Changs Rookie I took with me. Our waiter did everything right. Mixed the sauce, brought the food timed perfectly not rushed...  Plenty of time to let the appetizer settle before the entree arrived. Dessert arrived just in time to finish off the meal and again there was no rush. I'd have to give 5 stars to the service alone. It's always great. The place is always clean. I don't know if they have gnomes that clean when you're not looking but what ever it is it works. Even the bathroom (Mens, I've sadly never been in the Ladies room) The bottom line is that this is how a restaurant experience should be.

If I could, I would give this place NO STARS. First off, the food portioning at this location has gotten so much smaller but they definitely give you tons of soup! They were scared to give a larger bowl of rice to my party of 5. Next let's get to the even larger issue, the SERVICE IS TERRIBLE. My server tonight was Misty. No hello how are you guys doing just greeted by saying ""are you guys ready? Didn't wanna bother you guys taking the pictures"". Not friendly, not personable. It was my Mother's BIRTHDAY. Good thing it wasn't ruined by this incompetent service. She didn't come back to check on us or our drinks, never asked to refill. We had to ask for a refill after almost all the drinks were empty. When we asked for refills she acted as if it was an inconvenience for her. What pissed me off was my other cup that had some of my lemonade left, she grabbed across me to fill it with WATER. It clearly had a lemon on it. At the end when she was asking to clear up plates, we tried to help stack the plate so she could take it but once her tray was full she didn't even come back to get the other empty plates. DISGUSTED. She maybe came to the table at a total of 4 times only. And that included giving us the check. No manners at all. She reached past 2 people to hand over the check to my father instead of taking time and simple effort to walk it to him. So rude right in front of my mother's face. It's her birthday and this visit to this location almost ruined it. We've been coming here for 6 years now and this location has just tanked. HORRIBLE.

Well let me correct my self real quick, it was a little dark for me in there, I hate sitting in the dark, I mean I don't like bright lights either, but come one I like to see the person I'm dining with. The food was well cooked, and tasted great. This place can be a tad pricey especially after you figure out the cost of cooking the dish your self. If you want to have some pretty great tasting food then give this place a shot.Food Great tasting but overpriced, so make it a nice date.Atmosphere Nice and comfy but a little dark for my placeStaffVery friendly and enthusiastic about the food they serve and attentive as well.",92008
2361,"5621 Paseo Del Norte Carlsbad, CA 92008",Sara D.,"Denver, CO",1/8/2017,2,"2 stars only because I like the food. Missing 3 stars for service. This place clearly needs better training for their employees and better standards of customer service. I see other comments on here about rude staff and I second that as well as add that they aren't knowledgeable of the menu and are inexperienced in how to work with customers. I have dined at several PF changs and I enjoy the food, but the service at this location is the reason why I won't go. Either the kitchen cannot keep up with the servers or the entire place has a poorly run system. Small tables get served first over larger tables, the servers are not attentive and there is no warning about how long the food will take. I dined here with family and it took 1 hour and 20 mins to get our food. The servers excuse was ""we are really busy"". That doesn't make sense! PF Changs is always busy and you're in a strip mall location! Did management not train their employees on how to work efficiently when its busy? Maybe the server could warn people the kitchen is slow instead of disappearing? There were several empty tables and it was around 8pm. I felt the servers' excuses were poor and wonder how many times they use it a night. Will not dine here and would recommend Panda Express across the street over this PF changs location. Sorry guys, train your employees or kitchen staff better! 80mins is absurd to wait for food on a dine-in who made reservations, even on a ""busy"" night.",92008

Since they can't technically charge you for ""Atmosphere"" on the receipt, instead you will see over-priced food listed. Went here during lunch once and got an entree (nothing fancy, just equivalent to Kung-Pow Chicken) and the crab wontons (excellent). It came to about $25, about 3 times more than Pei Wei, the less expensive/Less fancy version of the restaurant owned by this PF Chang's. You pay for atmosphere and some decent food. I don't recommend coming here unless you can afford it, especially at dinner time.

The lettuce wraps, non-Chinese, but a good standard tasty fare.  The crab fried rice was soooo overpowered with bacon fat, you could not taste the crab over the fatty obliteration of the rice. The Salt and Pepper Prawns was the best dish on our table, moist, flavorful, chile hint and crispy. The green beans were fried, tasty and the chile mayo was just fat on fat in the dish.  The special chicken was ok, like firercracker chicken, ok.  The candy walnut shrimp was just disgusting, a soft greasy textured shrimp slathered in mayo (blah) with warm honeydew melon balls (why?) in the greasy sauce...gross.

While others not so much. We asked for salt and pepper and literally waited forever! We had to remind our waiter. To top it off, it wasn't even packed! We liked our server a lot, she was very nice but, it just took to long!

So every time we have seen a PF Chang we imagined it would be a classy place, with delicious food, excellent service, and a warm comfortable dining environment. Ummm..not so much in actuality. Sure it looks kind of fancy from the outside, and inside is decently appointed. But, it is run more like a family diner with a sports bar attached to it with high prices. We were seated at a table adjacent to the bar. The bar has two big televisions with sports channels on both. The crowd at the bar were t-shirt and ball-cap types just chatting up a storm and pounding the drinks. The same dress code and behaviors you might find at any mediocre sports bar. Rah Rah Rah,,,ugh.I felt overdressed, but for the prices on the menu I felt like I should dress the part. Confusion sets in. Is it a sports bar /restaurant, a family diner, or a decent Chinese restaurant? All the above..Feel free to wear flip flops with shorts n t-shirt. I will next time. Oh, and a foam finger to root for your sports team at the bar. I don't patronize sports bars intentionally.The service is good, the employees all friendly. But, for the prices, I expected not to have to ask for refills on the ice-teas a couple of times.  And I expect servers to know about the menu items more than just what the menu already says about it. The food is good. Maybe a couple notches better than Chin's, but not worth the prices. I will try a different location next time.",92008

I can't tell you how many times I went to my former in Emeryville with multiple groups of family/friends. Some of my family came down last weekend for my birthday and I tried to make a reservation. Come to find out that they had a 3 hour wait time for the next slot that they could fit me in. That's pretty much how I learned that these guys are new. North County is so deprived that when good stuff comes (Sonic, PF Changs) peeps go crazy for like 3 months. Lesson learned I made an online reservation for the actual night of. I went out with my pops and the waitress started out the night kind of awkardly. She greeted us and informed us that she was just giving our waiter his 30 minute break so she would be disappearing soon. She was a blond gal can't remember her name but I took this at a bad hint. We both got iced teas (fruity and jasmine). I love the fruity it's been amazing at every other P.F Changs that I have ever been to. But this time the fruitiness was really faint and to be frank it tasted like they got a little stingy on the tea leaves or something. My dads tea was worse really bitter. He asked for sugar and it took so long that by the time the blond came back another waitress had replaced my dads drink with a coke. You get the point she sucked.Anyways I got the Chengdu Lamb and my dad got the Double Pan fried noodles. I love the lamb its so tender and it WILL surprise you. I used to get the VIP Duck. But I've been reformed post nutritional guide. I didn't really like my Dad's it was too greasy and the sauce was a little too sweet. But I don't think it was cooked bad I just think it's my personal preference. Also the blond didn't ask me if I wanted brown or white rice. So I had to ask them to replace my white with brown. Good news is our ""real"" waiter came back at the end and he was way better. A little too much for my dad but I liked him. He also figured out that it was my birthday. The blonde didn't think to ask if we were celebrating an occasion or anything. Anyhoo I got my free shot glass full of cake (love them) and I managed to convince my waiter NOT to embarass the heck out of me. Which I appreciate :)",92008

Our daughter had warned us that her visit there with the In-Laws prior to our visit was disasterous, but we had high hopes that their visit was an isolated incident, just growing pains because they are so new.We ordered 3 appetizers that all arrived at different points throughout the meal. The final one came after they delivered the soup and immediately brought out the entrees. The entrees were luke warm.  It was weird and totally unorganized.  There was not enough room on the table for everything. There were 3 of us at a 4 person table, so even with the extra space on the table we were overflowing. I am giving this location one star because we have been to PF Changs all over and the service and food are always consistently wonderful.

Was seated at the bar in about 5 minutes, which was fine, however, immediately noticed that the two bar servers were completely overwhelmed handling not only the restaurant service bar, but the bar patrons as well as the take-out counter.  In no way could they do so efficiently,  or to anyone's satisfaction.It took 5 minutes to take my order and 20 minutes to bring the soup out, with people  who were seated after me, obtaining their orders more quickly. Finally the lunch order showed about a half-hour later. Had to jet so had the server bag it. No offer of discount or comp due to the poor service.  I wasn't looking for a freebie, and even tipped her, but no empowerment given to the staff. To their credit, the bar server was apologetic and friendly. Tracked down a very nice manager (the only one there) who was obviously doing double-duty covering for a myriad of positions that were not staffed properly. She was very nice and offered to comp lunch the next time, however, given time constraints during lunch-hour, I doubt I would chance going back, freebie or not.  Unless you have a minimum of an hour and a half, find a more professionally staffed environment.

I believe that only good chinese food is brought to you by a local chinese restaurant where the servers barely speaks english but speak fluent mandarin. Then you are wondering why I even step a foot in this restaurant, well... It was 9:40 pm on a Thursday night, just about 1 mile before the Palomar Airport road exit (on my way to pick up my niece) my sister called and asked me if I would like to grab a late dinner before leaving. Since the only restaurant that was open was PF Chang, we resorted to that. As soon as we walked in my brother  asked the host if they are still open and the server said that they dont close till 10 so why not, it was currently 9:45. I obviously disapproved, I work at a local clothing store and I hate people coming in a few minutes before closing time and I did not want sh***y food and horrible service. But I saw a few other parties besides us so I felt less guilty. Let me tell you the restaurant was SUBERB meaning the service was wonderful, the experience was wonderful. And no I do not use ""suberb"" but quite frankly I am in this review. James our server, was amazing and absolutely helpful. He did not rush us, nor made us feel that we were not wanted but instead treated us with amazing service. ( and he was quite charming as well which is always a plus haha) But besides the wonderful time with my family, and our server/ waiter being so helpful, we had an amazing night. Left at about 10:30 and there was still a party there. Well now time for the food, I did not want to mention it because it really was average. Your typical ""Americanize chinese food"" LIKE i said, if you want REAL chinese food you gotta go to the ones where the servers are speaking mandarin to you, where you can see through the crack of the kitchen door the chief cooking and the ones where the chairs, tables and tableware looks like they came straight from china. haha I am kidding, but do not count on this place for your authentic chinese food.",92008

A gluten free menu at a Chinese restaurant, SWEET!!!I realize for Chinese food its fairly generic but for a glutard like me being able to eat Chinese food at all is a real treat. That being said I genuinely like the street noodle dish and the chicken cup things. I even will admit to craving the noodles from time to time. It does have its downsides too; It's absurdly crowded most nights (like the people in Carlsbad have never seen a freaking PF Changs before) and the first time we went our server seemed like she was only operating on half a brain. Despite the fact I started my order with ""EVERYTHING NEEDS TO BE GLUTEN FREE"" She forgot every time and despite me reminding her she still served us an item with soy sauce and I got sick, which was lame. The next time we went back though our server was on his game and we had zero complaints. All and all its pretty good for what it is. Just be sure to check what you order is what you get if your GF.",92008

2412,"5621 Paseo Del Norte Carlsbad, CA 92008",Jac H.,"Maplewood, NJ",8/10/2013,1,"An extreme disappointment. If I could give zero or negative stars I think I would--and it is hard press for me to review a place to be this harsh on the establishment. This P.F. Changs was a let down after visiting a handful of locations in Burbank, Riverside, Rancho Cucamonga, and Las Vegas *inside Planet Hollywood Hotel and Resort*.  This one being across the Carlsbad Outlet mall - we were expecting standard across the board, this location was anything but standard.We had called ahead to reserve a table for the lunch hour, although it was not needed the place having ample seating arrangements filled between families and business folk - we grab a booth. Our server was new to the restaurant and I think new to being a waiter. We started out alright enough, we inquired about some of their drinks, and he recommending a bloody Mary, which was interesting...I asked him about a couple of the drinks and he had no idea, so I basically gained no recommendations. But, he was new and deserved a pass. I would imagine though the restaurant would give him a taste tasting or something to recommend at least its most popular drinks...I doubt bloody Mary's are on the 'most-popular' list. In the end, the drinks were okay, we decided to go with the lemon-vodka drink.  I didn't taste much liquor, it was mostly water and lemon taste. So, with drinks underway, we ordered one of their new starters the Peking Duck Roll.  I have been to China numerous times and have sampled Peking Duck, so I know I was not to expect that standard; however, being an upscale Chinese restaurant I had some hopes. The roll was served with cold duck, in rice wrap (the type you would make fresh lumpia in) and some veggies you'd find in fresh spring rolls. The dish tasted awful. The cook used way too much rice wrap because that is all I could taste. I deconstructed one piece of the roll and still could not taste anything, there was ZERO seasoning. So, when the waiter returned to ask how it was, I told him it was okay, but could use a lot more seasoning...his answer was 'Oh yeah, I tell them (the cooks) all the time that there should be more seasoning, but they don't listen'. ...SERIOUSLY dude!? After you recommending and stated how awesome the dish was, you tell me you've had problems with the dish??Our entrees arrived and look good. I had the almond-cashew chicken and my wife had kung pao chicken. Mine tasted okay; however, there were a couple pieces of the chicken that were tendons which were undercooked, it still had blood in it, so eating around those there was realistically only four pieces of eatable chicken. On the other plate, my wife's chicken although mild in spicy had WAY too much salt.Overall, this was a disappointment..and at that an expensive disappointment. We are no strangers to P.F. Chang's restaurants or their frozen meals in the grocery markets, but a $50 lunch meal that left us feeling upset that we spent that much money on bad food and drinks -- we will be passing on all things P.F. Chang's.",92008

Sure enough, egg shell!  Do not order  shrimp dumplings, they're full of I don't know what, but you can't call that shrimp. Now the entrees arrive right after the appetizers, keep in mind we were never given plates. We both ordered brown rice, they bring 1 brown 1 white. When I told them we didn't order white.

You'd think we'd have plates by now since all the food was delivered. No! I ask a busser for plates, he brings 2 right away. One clean and one completely dirty. One of us just ate from the appetizer dish and the other from the clean plate. Guess what, the food was all cold! I was over it. Just wanted it packed up and go home so I could nuke it. we waited another 20 minutes just for the check. Get this! The waitress walks behind me, stands right over my shoulder while I am going into my purse, she's looking in my purse! What a creep! I didn't know she was there cuz she was behind me.

Food-  The buddha's feast, stir fry was SOOOOO salty I couldn't swallow it.  I told her it was too salty that we couldn't eat it so she looked at me.  So I asked the waitress for a glass of hot water, which she brought.  After soaking it with the hot water 3 times, it was edible but still salty.  The sea bass sitting on top of spinach- again just soaked in soy sauce.  Sea bass was good.  The spinach was plain ridiculous.  Wonton soup appetizer was good.  Honey walnut shrimp was good.  Never going back again.",92008

We pointed out the wording on the coupon.  He went and talked with the manager and they were going to allow us our choice.  (???)  The reason they're only getting 3 stars is really pretty simple.  When anyone goes to a restaurant you want to be comfortable.  This place was like a meat locker because it was soooooo cold.  I'm rarely bothered by the cold but in this visit I had to go get my jacket to finish the meal.  We talked with the hostess.  She said she'd talk with the manager about turning up the heat.  We talked with our server and he said if they increased the temperature in the dining area the kitchen area and bar became too hot.  Well, we've been to this particular place several times.  We've been to their restaurant in Fashion Valley and this has never been an issue.  So, either their heating/cooling system needs to be redesigned/checked or the server's explanation was being pulled out of the dark recesses of his mind.  Regardless, the food was great, service okay but the room temperature was not acceptable.  If you go to this PF Chang's then bring an over-coat, don't wear shorts or sandals and be prepared to sit outside to be comfortable.",92008

As a chain restaurant, it is hard to compare as they follow the same recipes everywhere. So I will say that this restaurant's food tastes great and like all the others- which is a good thing. My favorite items from here are the lettuce wraps, pot sticker, broccoli beef and crispy honey chicken. Any time I have dined in or ordered out- the food is hot and ready which I appreciate. When I have dined in, the service has been quick, not a long wait to be seated and the servers themselves have been very nice. The restaurant is clean and they are quick to tidy up and clean up a table. The only thing I don't like about PF Changs in general is their egg drop soup. The broth that they use is gross- I believe it is beef based (for a vegetarian style soup, that is weird) and it is thick and almost slimy. I usually forget this and still order it each time with regret.

Justin wanted Panda and we were at the outlet mall so I convinced him to try something that hasn't been sitting in cafeteria trays all day. (thank goodness) We got there and ordered some appetizers and entrees and then we waited.. forever. Even though neither of us really cared because we weren't in any sort of hurry. The waiter made a point to come to our table often and appologize for the wait because apparenty everyone and their mother decided to order take out at the same time and the kitchen was super backed up. No problem, like I said, no rush. We were just hangin out drinking some delicious Arnold Palmers. Then the manager came and appologized... and then the waiter again. They were almost overly appologetic but it was very appreciated, we weren't angry at all. You can tell they take a lot of pride in their customer service. Anyway, when we finally got our food, it was delicious. Everyone tells me how badass P.F. Chang's is so I was really stoked when it lived up to the expectation. The cool part is that the manager gave us $10 off our bill and a free desert! Which by the way, I am obsessed with chocolate mousse - they have a mini chocolate mousse in a shot glass - Perfect! I was super happy with my first experience at P.F. Chang's and I'll definitely be back! :)",92008

Worst experience ever that started by being on hold for at least 15 minutes while driving in rush hour traffic. Once the gal finally answered, the phone disconnected. I got to the restaurant and it took the hostess about 10 minutes just to acknowledge me, instead she helped another customer so I ran to my car. I came back and she asked if I had been helped yet - she didn't even didn't recognize me - but finally took my order. A gentleman walked up who placed an online order that apparently never got placed. He was livid. Ten minutes later, she finally came back to me and asked if I had been helped. I said ""I'm still waiting for you to place my order.""  She disappeared again and eventually came back and placed it. She said it would be 15-20 minutes and it took 30.

Although we really weren't overly concerned, it wasn't going to ruin our moment to not get happy hour pricing.The bartender then pulled the menu back out in an attempt to prove us wrong.  However, he could not find any happy hour times listed so just finished with, ""Well, that's not right.  How would we make any money!?""So, we ordered off the regular menu, food was fine.However, P.F.

By regular I mean I probably ate there 3x/week back in the day and once a week during recent years. I have to say that this is the absolute WORST location I have been too. Last week I had my 3rd and last bad experience there. The service is slow. The past, oh 5x we've been there, our servers were apathetic and not very personable. One server took my sprite glass (which I assumed he was going to refill) and never brought it back. Portions are half the size they used to be. I remember always having leftovers. Now I am barely full when I leave. Food takes forever! I ordered my daughter a kid's meal when we first sat down and it arrived not only after our appetizer, but after our food. I'm talking 15 mins or so after our main course arrived. No apology from the server either. Last week I ordered a soup ""to go"" when we orders our food and wound up waiting about 15-20 mins after we finished eating for the soup. Since I had a sick husband at home waiting for this soup, I was not happy. Again, no apology from the server. No visit from a manager. Customer service with PF Changs used to be stellar.

2466,"5621 Paseo Del Norte Carlsbad, CA 92008",Brad B.,"Sacramento, CA",11/22/2009,2,"I've been a HUGE fan of the P.F. Chang's franchise for the last 10 years so when I first heard that one was coming to North County I was very excited.  However, after finally getting a chance to dine there today I'm quite disappointed.Upon arrival, the restaurant was on par with every P.F. Chang's I've ever been to: clean, upscale asian decoration, friendly waitstaff, etc.  We were quickly seated and offered beverages promptly.  We decided to start the meal with Spring Rolls and Chicken Lettuce Wraps.  To our surprise, the Spring Rolls came out quite quickly.  But to our disappointment looked like something you would find at a grocery store Chinese take-out.  They did not taste much better either - they were a bit soggy and mushy.  They were also a bit cold in the middle which revealed to us that they were definitely frozen.  I'd have to say I've had better at Panda Express.As we finished the Spring Rolls, the Chicken Lettuce Wraps came out.  These were definitely an improvement from the Spring Rolls.  They tasted as good as any I've ever had and the lettuce was very crisp.  There seemed to be a significantly larger amount of dried rice noodles, which forms the bed of the dish, than I'm used to which was a bit annoying to sift through.  In all, not a bad dish but could be improved with less noodles.For our main courses, we went for the Crispy Honey Chicken, the Beef A La Sichuan and the Lemongrass Prawns over garlic noodles.The Crispy Honey Chicken itself was very good: tender and covered in a sweet/tangy sauce.  I'm not sure why they call it ""crsipy"" though - it's not.  Not that it's ever been crispy at any other Chang's I've been to.  It's still a good dish.  They could improve this dish by decreasing the amount of rice noodles that forms the bed of this dish, much like the lettuce wraps.  I'm not a big fan of them at all.The Beef A La Sichuan had an overall good flavor but the vegetables were a big soggy.  I'm used to this dish being very crisp due to the celery and carrots.  We found the beef to be a bit on the done side as well (think crispy beef jerky).  Decent flavor here but a few tweaks and it would be much better.The Lemongrass Prawns were the best dish we ordered.  We particularly liked the presentation - whole prawns butterflied (with shells) and grilled shell down.  They had a mixture of lemongrass and other herbs/spices covering the prawns.  These were served over a bed of garlic noodles.  These garlic noodles are NOT the same garlic noodles that you would get if you ordered Garlic Noodles elsewhere on the menu, FYI.  Like I said, this was a good dish but not an overly asian tasting one.  If it were not for the lemongrass, it could easily be served at an italian restaurant.I will probably hold off on giving them another try for a few months until they iron out their wrinkles.  The meal was decent but I've been to so many P.F. Chang's over the years that I have a certain expectation and it was not met today and is the reason I'm giving them 2 stars.  Especially when the avg. dish is priced around $13.",92008

Most of the dinners have been because of gift cards I have received for Christmas or ones others have received and don't want. Last night was the final straw.  The food was and always is too salty! Our server even said that it was too salty for his liking as well. They never brought us dinner plates so we had to eat off of the little appetizer plates. We ordered three dinners and expected to share them as it is common and that way we can all try different dishes. Our server was was great though. Most everyone I know likes P.F.

Chang's to try their happy hour for the first time.  Prior to this we'd only been there for lunch, which was also very good.  Wow!  Happy Hour was fantastic!  $4.00 beers, $6.00 craft cocktails, and scrumptious, healthy food items from $4.00 - $6.00 with good-sized portions.  We tried the spicy tuna roll, pork dumplings and chicken jicama tacos with peanut sauce - delish!  The only drawback some of the other customers at the bar.  The crowd was mostly in their 70's and boy were they cranky!  One couple was complaining both to a manager and the bartender because the menu had changed, and another guy was having a fit because he didn't like the way the bartender was pouring his beer (which was perfect btw).  In spite of this, the bartender/server Dayton kept his cool, expressed empathy while they continued to berate him and couldn't have been nicer to us (note we aren't teenagers ourselves).  We will be back soon - next time we'll just make sure we sit next to happy people at happy hour!",92008

He would call the Kun Pao Chicken by some other dish name and we were like huh? we didn't order that. And then I was asked if I wanted brown or white rice, I said brown and of course they brought me white. The food was so so. Nothing impressive about it. Was really dry, no sauce. I've had fast food chinese that tasted better. So to put it mildly...I won't be eating here again.

At 6:30, we complained in a friendly way to the manager - and he apologized profusely and gave us the entire dinner on the house. (Apparently what had happened was that the gluten-free prep takes longer since they clean all the pots to avoid cross-contamination, which is great and conscientious...but they had misplaced part of our order.)

It had carrots in it and my son is allergic.  He got very angry and waived the orders in my face and said ""see we have all these orders in front of you"".  Feeling very uncomfortable and not wanting to make a scene in front of my 8 year old I told my son don't worries we will go get something else.  The manager flung the doors open and stomped out and said ""is this the dish""? and grabbed it from my son.  He then proceeded to say ""fine I will remake it for you in front of all of the orders"".  When he came out he said ""here is your order and I made it in front of all the orders"".  Each time he spoke to us he was speaking loud enough for everyone in the restaurant to hear and it was very uncomfortable.  THIS WAS THE MANAGER!!!!  At this point I just wanted to leave without any food because I was very embarrassed.  I have been a regular customer for a long time and go there at least 10 times a month.  I will NEVER go there again.",92008

Their Honey Walnut Shrimp is one of my favorite dishes, and the banana egg roll dessert is amazing, plus I love the ice cream that comes with it. The reason why it only got 4 out of 5 stars for me was the fact that sometimes their service at this location isn't always... perfect. My boyfriend and I ordered food for pick-up, I waited by the bar where I usually do and it took some time, and a lot of servers looking at us and walking past, before someone acknowledged that we needed someone. After some more waiting for our order I asked about my togo order of the banana rolls that come with icecream and whether it would still have the ice cream since it is take out, they assured me that the icecream is placed in a container with ice to keep from melting. Unfortunately when I got home, I did have the banana rolls but there was no ice cream.

One thing that seems consist is the poor lighting. I know this must be for ambiance but , many patrons when I surveyed the room straining with menus leaning toward the windows. Now for the food.  Again, having eaten at other PF Chang  It seems that quality is lacking here in Carlsbad. Twice before I received a rice bowl with cold rice. Again this visit I had to request hot rice.  I don't think it is too much to ask that food be hot when served. I enjoyed my dish  which was char wok beef. My dad ordered VIP duck.  When he received his meal the duck was not cold but close. We asked the waiter and her answer was this is how it is prepared and left. Not bothering to ask  if  there was anything she could do. Albeit this waiter was in training with another waiter standing behind her.Overall I think management needs to pay a bit more attention to food preparation  and the lighting issue.",92008

The food was great as usual, although the portions are on the small to moderate size and are on the upper end of pricing. I ordered a premium cocktail on the rocks and was really disappointed at how small the pour was, especially for the price. I mentioned it to the waiter and she had a manager at our table in minutes.

We attracted by the Name and the free lettuce wrap offer which clearly stated one per person per entree which we verified with a phone call. There was three of us but we got only one wrap order. The manager said she was sorry a dozen times but was adament to do anything to allay our disappointment. We then amended our order from three entrees to one but added soup.The soup (won ton ) was in my opinion tastelesss although my cohorts liked it. The wrap was good what there was of it.We shared a Hunan Pork and it was disappointing to say the least. Poor taste, low quantity although this unto itself may have been a blessing. I hate to waste my appetite on poor food.I would like to know why the entree had to be served at the same time as the soup.

Well actually, the glasses! I can't believe it took me so long to realize that the pilsner glasses they serve their beer in are only 14 ounces and not a 16 ounce pint. Mind you, my tip did not reflect this injustice but I was astounded to find that they were out right pulling the wool over my and everyone else's eye's with this. After asking my waiter what size the skinny pilsner glass was I asked for my next beer to be in a pint glass same as the waters on our table were. He brought my beer back and apologized for the ""short"" beer in reference to the 14 ounce's in my 16 ounce glass. Exactly what I thought! I immediately went to the bar and asked for my 2 missing two ounces por favor! They went to get the manager and HE told me that was company policy.

This one is relatively new, quite good and has an interesting decor. I visited it shortly after it first opened since I happened to be in So CA at the time; I ordered two orders of lettuce wraps at the bar one vegan and one chicken, and had a nice cup of white tea with it. They have a great cocktail selection and a good selection of wine and beer, but I was on the wagon that night. The place is across the street form the Carlsbad Outlet mall, and on weekends there is always a full parking lot, and long waits. It's pretty close in quality to what I refer to as the P.F. Chang Mother Ship at the Irvine Spectrum, my first experience with P.F. Chang's. Good service and good Asian Fusion. I like the decor as it is bit more modern than some of the other P.F. Changs. Last night, a Sunday night, was very crowded with long waits, so we did take-out for the first time. Grabbed a good bottle of sake and ate to hearts content on the patio. As usual, every bit of our order was exactly what we expected. Great lettuce wraps, Prawns, etc. We had a great time and it was nice to know that their take-out delivers the same quality.",92008

I think its great that a restaurant is doing great business. I also don't mind if there is a wait. Hey! the food is really good here. But when the restaurant can't manage or handle the amount of people it has comming in. You are going to have some pissed off people. This place has no control. Management is to blame for this. REGULATE YOUR CUSTOMER TRAFFIC SO THAT YOU CAN HANDLE WHAT YOU HAVE. I placed an order to go, I was told 45 minutes. No problem. I understand you are busy. I showed up an hour later. Plenty of time to get the food ready. There is no one to help you in the take out department. One girl running around like a chicken with its head cut off. Just like everyone else in this place. It's totally out of control and they don't seem to give a shit. Needless to say, I waited another 45 minute while I was there for my food. Finally I got home with it and it wasn't my order.

The manager was going around apologizing for the ridiculous wait and promising free food... great $8 free for waiting two hours!  Even worse... the food was AWFUL! It was overly saucy and tasted like watery chemically sauce.  I have NEVER walked out on a restaurant before but even though it was free, we didn't eat it.  We were so upset after waisting two hours to get such bad food we really wanted to manager to know it was not ok.  Anyways... the moral of this very long review is next time I'm driving down to UTC.",92008

We dined at lunch and I ordered the bibimbap bowl with chicken but it came with beef. I didn't realize it was beef because I tried a bite of better half's Mongolian beef and his beef tasted like good quality steak. After a couple of bites we decided that my meat definitely wasn't chicken. Our server apologized and the manager actually removed it from the bill which was nice. Once I got the chicken I was happy because it was quality chicken and tasted far better than the beef. Still not sure why they are using a different cut of steak in the Mongolian dish. That was pretty good but way too many onions we thought. They lost a star for the lobster roll which was pricey at $17 and the lobster wasn't very flavorful. We were wishing we had tried the spicy tuna roll instead. I think PF Chang's is kind of overpriced for what it is but I might return for the chicken bibimbap bowl because it was tasty.,91915

Once again he said the place was packed with people waiting for their orders and nobody seemed to know what was going on. The girl told my husband it would be another hour.

The most basic dish in an Asian restaurant. The dish was almost burned tasted horrible. We ask for broccoli to be steamed soft and it was super crunchy. Didn't follow request at all.Manager didn't seem to care at all. My wife had to run my daughter to another restaurant because we couldn't wait on food any longer with a starving toddler. My baby was crying out of hunger and they didn't even care to hurry up. We told the waitress "" please go and check"" and she said ""I'm going right now"" and right after bringing plates to other table and taking an order she went to the kitchen. Ridiculous",91915

I haven't been to a P.F. Chang's in a number of years. Before I was a young Padawan I honestly didn't know any better. Forgive me! Then I started to discover better Asian fusion food in San Diego and other parts of the country, and this started to show for the lackluster over-priced over-saturated food that it is.What barely passes for edible food at P.F. Chang's is incredibly bland. We got two cups of soup (wonton and egg drop) and while both were piping hot when they got to our table, they had no flavor. These were followed by the chicken lettuce wraps, which come with minced ground chicken and a generous amount of lettuce meant to hold the chicken like a taco, only it doesn't taste like anything. I ate the lettuce like there was no tomorrow, since it was the only decent thing on the plate.We also had some steamed pork dumplings which were tepid and like everything else had no flavor, even with the mixed soy-mustard-chili paste concoction slathered on.We were seated in one of those elevated booths along the side of the restaurant so you have plenty of people-watching opportunities since you get a good view of the entire room. Each server has more than his/her fair share of tables but what's weird is that they are scattered all over the restuarant. Don't servers in a restaurant normally have a 'section' and the tables they are helping are near one another all in one area? These folks were running to/from every corner of the restaurant so sometimes our lady would be elsewhere for long chunks of time. When we were seated it was a good 10 minutes before we were greeted, and we were checked on once while eating at which point I asked for another tea which took another 10-15 minutes to deliver. She kept apologizing as she sped by with a big platter carrying the dirty plates and glasses from at least 4 other tables on her shoulder. At the end it was another 20-30 minutes to ask for the check and pay. We felt like hostages unable to get on with our evening.These finger foods and two drinks (both non-alcoholic) came to $40 after tip. The price point made me sicker than the food.Skip this place (and any outlets of it) and stick to the places on Convoy or pretty much anything else.",91915

Why not, and thus we came in here and have a whirls of dishes we ordered.We ordered dimsum- dumplings which was presented as wonton. That right there was a bad start for me. Since I was looking forwards to some shrimp dumplings. Instead, what was before me was these square sorry excuses of ""wonton like."" Luckily the next dish make up for its previous dish. Dynamite shrimp. Quite tasty! Then my friend order a dynamite sushi roll and I ordered the Hokkien noodles. Again the noodle dishes was actually wrongly named of its regions.The menu gives the unknown eaters that its inspired dishes from Northern China. I can said this. If people from Northern China saw these dish or see how their origins dish turned to the current form. I think they will have some cows about it.

Plenty of parking, nice decor. Service was good, and everyone was friendly... Appetizers- They chicken lettuce wrap is something I always get here.. rich in flavor, it was actually a bit salty. We also got calamari which I didn't eat, but our group killed it... the edamame was cooked just right, not too firm and not too soft, and not heavily seasoned. The kids ordered their noodles as well as their sweet and sour chicken from the kids menu. The sweet and sour chicken was actually a pretty generous portion for a kid's meal, the noodles were a smaller portion. The two kids shared their kids meals, and they devoured it, especially the noodles. So the food here was all very good. Served hot and tasted of fresh ingredients. Very rich in flavors. The portions are smaller, compared to the other Mongolian/Chinese restaurants around. I noticed their portion sizes varied though. Some dishes were more generous than others.

The hostess politely said,"" It's not busy anymore since the dinner rush just finished."" But, I couldn't wait 20 minutes for a seat & then another 15 minutes for our first bite to arrive, (If we waited for a table).I decided to plant my starving butt on a bar stool instead. The bartender, Nathaniel, was really busting his behind from moving some empty glasses at the bar to the end section of it to making adult drinks for the wait staff to bring to their tables.Thank goodness for the 2 tv's situated at each end of the bar (and they both had different channels. NBA & Jeopardy.)I started off w/ a coconut mojito. I never seen one on a drink menu before & this caught my attention. The taste was so refreshing. It reminded me of a Bai Antioxidant Infusion drink (I love this brand!) Very subtle on the Malibu Coconut Rum though. But, indeed a nice way to smooth things over for a bit.I also tried for the first time a cup of hot & sour soup. Which, straying away from what I would usually get, the reg drop or wonton soup- I loved it! Can't believe it took me this long to try this! The broth was super thick, which I like & what makes it so tangy?! Mmm! The tiny cubes of tofu, bamboo shoots & the egg were delicious.When the crispy green beans came, the tempura batter wasn't over shadowing the green beans. They were lightly coated & the beans were fried wonderfully. They weren't greasy & the soggy either. I think the signature dipping sauce may have some sriracha in it! Can't go wrong w/ spicy, right?!The honey chicken was the best way to really end my dinner. Tender & not overbearingly sweet. The honey wasn't gooey. I added low sodium soy sauce to my steamed brown rice. Simple orders. Nothing fussy. So glad I strayed away from the usual items I would order.

After hearing that my husband asked her if we could sit inside instead since the waiting was only 10-15 minutes and she told him before 25-30, but she refused to respect our spot cause they were now listed to dine in even though we arrived first and at the end the did not care. So we decided to leave. Thank You.",91915

We really loved the Spicy Chicken Soup that is now gone and that was our #1 family favorite dish. We want the old menu back! Stick to what you were good at.,91915

Everytime I eat at PF Chang's, I alway notice that the plates aren't as clean and there are smudge marks on the brims if the plates. Considering where I live, this area does not offer any authentic or even decent Asian/Chinese restaurants, so you make provisions just to be able to have something different. I ordered the salt and pepper shrimp, Mongolian beef, lettuce wraps, fried rice, and wonton soup. I had three other people with me so this was more than enough food. However, o just feel that over the years, the quality of the food and service for that matter have gone down.  Either the food is good or it isn't. It's usually hit or miss for me. My meal on the scale of 1-10 was about a 6.  Hopefully next time around, I'll have a better experience.",91915

The lettuce wraps were the only thing decent.  The Chicken Fried Rice and Changs Spicy Chicken were not very flavorful or tasty.  Sad because when we usually have eaten there the food seemed a little better.  I guess calling in started out the meal on the road to a subpar level.",91915

Parking here is fine, pricing is okay. The vibe- always busy, usually pretty loud. The service is good. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5, is because the cooking may occasionally be inconsistent. When we ate the chicken wraps today, we noticed that it had a sort of smoked/burnt/overcooked flavor. It didn't really bother me, but my husband noticed it. Still ate it.

As we walked in, we were greeted Hi and seated at a booth. I decide to order a tropical iced tea to drink. So good! For starters, I got the California rolls. There was eight in a plate. I came hungry! The rolls were good. I finished them up quickly. For my main entree, I went with the lobster fried rice. It had a scrambled egg, shiitake mushrooms, red jalapeños which gave it heat, sprouts, endame beans and pieces of lobster. I loved the lobster pieces in there. They were deep fried in a crunchy batter. I did not like the fact they left the lobster tail shell in the dish. I actually had a piece of that shell in my mouth. Ugh. Anyway, the food was pretty good overall. Service was great by the waitress who served us. She made sure our drinks were refilled. I had a second refill of the tropical iced tea.

We drove all the way from Alpine to come here for my Mother's Day dinner and it was just an awful experience and a huge disappointment. To start, we had reservations and still had to wait almost 15 mins to be seated. Once we were seated our server immediately greeted us and got us started on drinks and took our app order. I asked her if the Veggie Lettuce Wraps had tofu in them and she said no, then when she had them at the table she said actually they do and there wasn't a way for them to make them without the tofu but if we didn't want them she would take them back and take off our bill. We chose to send them back. It is disappointing that she did not know the menu well enough to know that and couldn't have asked before having them made and at our table for us to then have to be jerks about it and say no thanks. Here is where it all goes downhill, it was about 35 mins after we put our order in and we still had not gotten our entrees. Keep in mind we ordered only two things, honey shrimp, and lo mein. My 4 year old and 9 month old were getting antsy so I went up to the hostess desk and asked to speak to the manager. He came out and to be honest was pretty dismissive. He didn't really hear me out before cutting me off and saying he was going to go check on our food. He disappeared for almost 15 mins! In the meantime two tables that sat down after us were paying their checks!!!! Finally the manager came out of the kitchen with our food! In total it took over 45 mins from the time we ordered to actually get our food!!! How is this acceptable?! He apologized and did add some extra shrimp to our order but the lo mein portion was scarce and not as flavorful as normal. And when I say scarce I mean it was all of maybe 10 bites! The kicker? When we got our bill we were charged for the lettuce wraps we did not end up getting due to the tofu so I had to take this up with the manager. He then took that off and also removed the shrimp from our bill as well due to the wait. Keep in mind, our bill was still almost $40.00 with these items removed and that is with zero alcoholic drinks! This is my first time at this location and I can 100% say that we will never be back! Especially when the table next to us told us that the last time they were there they waited 40+ mins for their food! I hope Corporate reads this review and can look into this store. PF Chang's has been one of my favorite restaurants ever for a long time and I have such a bad taste in my mouth now that I am just not in any rush to come back!  Especially after my Mother's Day dinner was ruined!

Normally I don't post about how poor customer service is considering it's a holiday, but feelcompelled to try and sum up the 4 hours I wasted at Chang's. Probably should have seen it coming, but never have I been part of a fouled up situation of management's ineptness  to handle the volume of orders that streamed through the place. The poor workers were trying their best to help customers where they could, while the 1 manager on duty stood behind the counter and offered no assistance, explanation, or leadership to curtail the many unhappy customers inquiries and questions.  Left all that to a staff who obviously couldn't support the wave of orders that had been placed today. No real game plan to streamline order pick up and management's greed to not cut off or limit. Very disappointed to see the whole cluster, for 4 long hours, evolve before my eyes. If I didn't have 6 others at home waiting for me on the 4:30 Pick up and not actually getting my name called until 8:45, I would have left and waited my 7 business days for a refund.  Piss poor planning by leadership at this location and have learned my lesson. Used to think P.F. Chang's was a higher end Asian establishment, but that has been ruined all on one long 4+ plus hour wait and watching the cluster show live and upfront. Also, letting a guy get drunk in their bar and warning him 3 times to be respectful to other customers and staff. The manager again, had no balls to remove him for the safety of others as he was clearly inebriated pulling is mask down and putting his arm around patrons. Unbelievable!! Can't make this stuff up. Once I finally got my food that I paid $160.00, got home to unveil the small portions of food in each of the trays. My family was in shock at the portions. This was most likely due to the 100+ orders that just sat on the tables that were cancelled by irate customers. Would say about 10k worth of wasted food that sat and sat for hours. For most part, people were trying to be patient. Yet this has to be a lesson learned to management at the CV location that you have lost much more tonight for being greedy and not planning for the days events. Hats off to the staff who were under duress and boo to the manager on duty for stepping up as he should have done. Lost my future business in a matter of hours.",91915

Dead silence for a couple seconds so I said we are 4. How did she ever pass the interview process to be a greeter ?!? You can barely hear her voice and not personable at all.We followed her to the table. That was awkward!!!! Waitress took a while.  I was frustrated by this time.We had their chicken lettuce wraps and egg drop soup. That was delicious and a very good portion.Food was good - service was horrible! They weren't even busy. We came after lunch hours around 2:30pm. We needed boxes the waitress grabbed more than what we needed and didn't even hand it to us. She set it on a tray and we had to help ourselves, which I thought was weird. Not a fan!!!",91915

For drinks I got a margarita because why not eh? Definitely in the top best 5 margaritas I've had! Nicely proportioned with a extra splash of that kick we all love, want and definitely need!The reason for the 3 out 5 is not because there was anything wrong with the food! No issue with the drinks! But because of the following two reasons. - 1: our service wasn't the greatest, there was a lot of assumptions rather then asking for clarification. - 2: most important because I've never actually experienced this before at any restaurant but the dishes that were given to us to split our food and eat off of, were filthy. I picked up each plate hoping it was just one but all the plates underneath and even a few on top you could feel the food from, I don't wanna say the previous customers but practically the day before.

I've heard good things about this place and it wasn't worth it. I gave two stars out generosity but also because the food was packed well and the food was still at a good temperature. I got the sesame chicken with fried rice and I didn't like it. It was $20 which I guess is reasonable because it was a kind of nice sized portion but there was barely flavor on the chicken and the rice tasted like nothing.

Chang's is definitely an upscale restaurant in terms of the decor. The furniture, the wall decorations, and the environment is nice.THE FOOD:I enjoy the food from P.F. Chang's. I have tried many dishes, many times. My favorite is to start with the Chang's Chicken Lettuce Wraps, hold the crispy rice sticks (wok-seared chicken, mushrooms, green onions and water chestnuts over crispy rice sticks, with crisp lettuce cups, $9.50). I hold the crispy rice sticks because they taste like nothing and stick on everything. It is more clean without them. Other than the lettuce wraps I think both the Northern-Style Spare Ribs and the Chang's BBQ Spare Ribs, each $10.50, are really good.The Norhter-Style Spare Ribs are slow-braised and dry rubbed with Chang's five-spice seasoning. The Chang's BBQ Spare Ribs are slow-braised and wok-seared with a tangy Asian barbecue sauce.The plates that I really like as entrees are: 1. Walnut Shrimp with Melon (tossed in a light Asian aioli with warm candied walnuts and cool honeydew melon, $17.50)2. Crispy Honey, hold the crispy rice sticks (lightly battered in a sweet and tangy honey sauce with green onions over a bed of crispy rice sticks - chicken $14.50, shrimp $17.50) -- I would especially hold the crispy rice sticks here because they will COVER the chicken due to the honey sauce.Your food will come with white rice, brown rice, or you can do half and half. I love their brown rice. I recently tried a dessert that was a sort of dulce de leche cake. It was good but very sweet for me so I only had a couple of bites. It is a generous slice. I posted a photo.THE TIPS:P.F. Chang's has a special sauce concoction of soy sauce, hot mustard, and red pepper paste. Your server will mix it for you and you can add it to your food. It is a tasty touch. Note: I actually had a recent concern with the bill I received. You can clearly see that my total was $45.85. When I looked down at the bottom of the receipt it says ""For your convenience, 15%= $8.54, 18%= $10.25, and 20%= $11.39. If my math is correct, 15% of my bill is $6.87, 18% is $8.25, and 20% is $9.17. Why the inflated numbers? Unless someone can give me an explanation I would be wary of the recommendations.",91915

I was in the mood for some fish, so I ordered their Norwegian Salmon steamed with ginger served over stir-fried shiitake mushrooms, bok-choy, tomatoes and asparagus in a light broth priced at $18.95 (yelp.com/biz_photos/p-f-…).When I ordered, I told the waitress, I did not want the rice and asked if I could have a side of vegetables or salad. She told me it was not a problem. When my meal arrived, given the salmon was steamed it lacked any searing color, but the salmon was a good portion. (yelp.com/biz_photos/p-f-…) It was tender and had good flavor, but it was a little over done. I asked for it medium and it came cooked through. All the vegetables tasted very good, but the mushrooms were a little underdone. Also, I thought the dish needed more vegetables. (yelp.com/biz_photos/p-f-…) The broth underneath was seasoned well and went well with the salmon. Half way through my meal, I realized I did not get my side I asked for instead of the rice that came with the meal. When I questions the waitress, I quickly realized she either forgot or did not follow through. She apologized and I asked her to please bring me a side salad. The salad was okay and came with a light lemony dressing. (yelp.com/biz_photos/p-f-…) The greens were basic but fresh.Every thing about my meal and service was just okay.

And anytime we tried to grab any waiter/waitress/bus boy just to ask for another drink, not one stopped, they just nodded and said yeah as they were running by. Finally, we were so thirsty(even our water glasses were dry) my husband walked back to the bar to get us drinks. No one ever checked on us after we got our food to see if we needed anything or if our order was correct. Nothing. Nada. Finally we flagged our waitress down-we practically had to tackle her-and asked for to-go boxes and our check ASAP. She took another 15 minutes to do that, never asked how dinner was-Nothing! Ugh, spent $100 on dinner for horrible service, we left so frustrated and angry. The only reason I give one star is because the food was good but not worth the aggravation!",91915

Their menu changed a lot to being more Asian fusion than just American Chinese. Server was excellent & helpful with menu questions + suggestions. The waiting, food, and cleanliness of tables need some work.Wonton Bowl:I miss the soup having bok choy, it has spinach now. It needs a little kick like ginger, but I guess not everyone likes ginger. The broth was okay. Water chestnuts adds texture, but I noticed a few people around my table complained about it. Fried Brown Rice with combo meat (chicken, shrimp, & beef): The chicken felt dried, beef was okay, and only two pieces of shrimp. The brown fried rice was cooked nicely, not dry at all. The component was ""meh"", it needs more veggies like carrots or peas. The presentation was just too brown.Chang's Spare Ribs: For $10.95, it's a serving of 6 riblets, with a tiny amount of pickled veggies on the side like radish, daikon, and carrots. The sauce was just too sweet; reminds me of a teriyaki bbq sauce than the traditional Korean bbq style that I'm used to. Sichuan Asparagus: Server recommended this to us, we loved this dish. It wasn't spicy at all. I am the type of person who cannot eat spicy. It's actually pretty tasty to accommodate the brown fried rice and plain white rice that was served with the BBQ ribs.Honey chicken: Doesn't remind me of orange chicken (similar, but not the overly sweet kind). It was glazed properly, chicken was tender, but I wasn't a fan of the fried glass/white thin noodles. I thought they could have done better.",91915

Being the popular lady, we had to call ahead for a 10 person table. The hostesses graciously set us up with a nice centralized half table/booth. I was impressed with the customer service every step of the way. Our waiter was quite pleasant and attentive to the needs of our elderly guests.The food was superb! Started with the chicken lettuce wraps, spare ribs and wonton soup. For the entrees, we had everything from marinated sea bass to Korean spicy chicken. Everything popped and sizzled with flavor and not too much spice (unless you poured on the chili mix). I am always a fan of the almond and cashew chicken, beef with broccoli and the Chang's spicy chicken. We opted out of dessert this time because the food fills you up. If you're already familiar with PF Changs or Pei Wei, you know what to expect when you come here. I found this location to be among the top of the locations that I have experienced. Grade: A",91915

Loved the ambience and dim lighting. Although, if we were seated at a table in the middle of the restaurant we would have definitely needed a flashlight to see the menu because there was no light hitting some of them at all! The food was tasty! My eggplant was a little too salty, but I gobbled it up nonetheless because the flavor was delicious! If vegetables tasted like that all the time, I'd be a vegetarian!! We also got the Wok-Beef plate or something like that, the Surf & Turf, & pepper beef. They were all good! I wouldn't recommend coming here for Chinese takeout all the time though.

He didn't like the sauce but didn't want him to take his original order back just because he didn't want to make the waiter go back. Well at the end of our meal the waiter came back with the check and to our surprise he removed the lomein from the bill.

I must disclose that we were only here for a few beers and appetizers and did not sample any of their main dishes. When we arrived there were people waiting and we were told it would be about a 20 minute wait. We opted to sit at the bar since they offer their full menu anyway. Our beers were served in an iced mug which is always preferred. Our appetizers were the crab wontons that were plated on a sweet and sour sauce. My appetizer of choice were the steamed pork dumplings with spicy chili oil. The dumplings did not come in their traditional canister but I had to remember that this wasn't a small mom & pop shop and it was a chain. The chili oil was not spicy but did have an okay flavor to it. The biggest thing that turned me off from this location was service. Our table was sticky. We mentioned it to our server and he gladly cleaned that right up. Since we sat in the bar area, we constantly heard the servers complaining. They were loud and very obnoxious about it. Their gripe was that 6 tables had complained about the lettuce wraps. I now know not to order them.

We even asked a random bus boy and he never brought one either. When we confronted her about the lack of service she made excuses and the simple fact she forgot about us, we however didn't see her talk to any of her tables at all... luckily the manager was accommodating, but it was still after the fact.",91915

Perhaps because of the very blunt and direct manner in which it was drafted. Let me tell you, ALL of it was well deserved. So here I am again, against my better judgement, with a reservation and the dining room was not prepared. Again THIS particular PF Changs has not come through so far. The clock is ticking...and I am still not impressed. With an itchy trigger finger, I am ready to write this restaurant off for good. Then we were served by Jessica....Waiting took only a few minutes and right away, within another couple minutes, Jessica introduced herself and had water on the table. She handled all 13 of us juggling bar requests, food orders, and paid attention to the 5 kids that was in the group. A far cry from the last experience for the review of which was never posted. We continued on and waited for the common meltdown THIS PF Chang is known for. Jessica was on the spot with refills, plate clearing and even offered more of her personality. She easily handled the party of 13 with ease like a seasoned server. Come to find out, that was her first large party! We were all impressed! To top the night, she brought out the cake, cut it up and served everyone. Thanks to Jessica, she saved this patron from posting a ballistic and scathing review. One of which would have been well deserved. Good job to her and will not mind returning.",91915

I had to call him back over for a second round only to have him come back a couple minutes later saying"" Just so you guys know happy hour is over now so the drinks are regular price ok.""  It was 6:06! A good server at any restaurant would go to their table and kindly ask the patrons ""Did you want to put in another round of drinks before happy hour ends?""  RIGHT?  That pissed us off.

I have only ever eaten in but during this particular visit, I opted for takeout. I used the online option and was happy with the overall feel of their website. Customers can choose how many soy sauce packets they want, chopstick amounts, paper plates, chili sauce, etc. Great options! When I picked up my food, the process was great. The takeout orders are taken care of at their own part of the counter and was very efficient. It was the first time (I hate admitting) that I ever tipped the person who helped me with takeout. The gentleman who helped me really made me feel like he was my waiter; not just a cashier. I wish I had caught his name :(Upon getting my food home (I don't like far), it was not very warm. Mind you, I had to wait once I arrived. The pick up time was given to me at the time of ordering online and I did arrive on time. Since I had to wait about 5-7 minutes, I assumed the food would be hot. That was not the case. I will likely return for their happy hour and sit down for dinner or lunch. I doubt I will ever use the takeout option. It really takes a lot for me ever consider takeout at any restaurant and when I am paying a descent price for Chinese food, I do expect a very similar temperature of food when I get it down the road to my home. I should not have had to microwave my food. Better luck to others!",91915

We explored the menu for about ten minutes. The tables next to us were being promptly served, and there was a healthy energy around the place. We decided on what we were going to order, twenty minutes after we sat down. Long story short, we waited for 35 minutes and we never had a server come by and check on us or even take our drink order. This was my first impression of P.F. Chang's. I generally sympathize with people in the service industry and I would never really act coldly or rude to a server, but our server was MIA and the other servers didn't want to add to their workload and would totally checkout and ignore our empty table. I watched the movie ""Waiting"" and I fear confronting people who serve our food. We just walked out and this is the first time I ever walked out of a restaurant.

It's all because of the prices, lack of authenticity, and better food choices in the area. Most of the entrees I've tasted were salty, especially the Mongolian Beef. The interior of this branch is poorly set up, so a full house of dining customers would be stuffed in a single room like a can of sardines. If you're dining here with someone, you'd have to yell at him or her. I'm glad I didn't have to pay when I went here since dinner was on my uncle and aunt.What I liked here:- The Crispy Honey Shrimp was so delicious. The shrimp is tender and each piece isn't heavily battered like in some mom n pop Chinese restaurants. I would return just for that item for takeout. I hope Pei Wei's Honey Seared Shrimp is similar.- Our waitress was attentive and made sure everyone in my group was satisfied.- Free dinner!",91915

Not really athentic but then again Mongolian beef by nature is not...it just tasted too sweet. Not the salty-oniony taste I wanted. The portion of meat was huge..which is the only reason it got 2 stars instead of 1 because honestly I can get better for almost half the price i also knocked them for the tiny amount of rice compared to the meat. It was pitiful. Would likely not return unless provoked.,91915

If I get the choice of Chang's over the other chains like, On the Border, TGIF, Chile's, Applebee's, Barfbee's, Ptomaine Joe's or any of the others I will always choose PF's. In addition to a nice facility, they always have a slew of hottie hostesses in clingy black outfits. Makes the $9.95 Tuna Tataki worth it!WHEN YOU GO- don't skip the crab wantons and a large Kirin. All the entrees are very standard Chinese fare that you can get at any of the Panda/Pick Up/Inn/Stix, but again you get a sit down dinner experience and I've always had decent service here.",91915

It's like a Shrimp taco using a Bao. You get three on a plate. The flavor was excellent and they were easy to eat. The Bao kept the ingredients together. Also ordered the large bowl of Wonton Soup. The pork wontons were excellent. The white meat chicken not so much. Seemed dry or over cooked. The temp of the soup was not as hot as we had hoped. Our second helping the soup was luke warm at best. Our server was new and could not answer our menu questions. I don't blame her I blame the training.,91915

I haven't eaten at PF Chang's for a couple years now. So, I was so surprised to see that they had a great happy hour and pretty good selection of lunch specials. Food: I ordered the Crispy Chicken on top of brown rice w/a side of hot and sour soup. I think it was like $8 bucks or so. Not bad! The chicken was sweet w/a citrus twist. And the brown rice wasn't hard, but well cooked. Happy Hour: They had a great selection that ranged from $3 to $7 bucks...or so. We got the crispy green beans, chicken lettuce wraps and calamari. The green beans were massive for $4 bucks. After a few bites though the fried stuff gets to you. So, I started peeling off the fried batter and it still tasted good w/their chipotle sauce. The lettuce wraps and calamari were average. But, I liked how the calamari was lightly battered. FYI: If you're going to order a lot of fried stuff...try to balance it w/some fresh eats like the lettuce wraps. My bf got a headache from all the grease! Service: It was awesome! Our waitress Heather was friendly, smiley and helpful. She also brought out a complimentary chocolate dessert w/raspberry sauce for my bday!

The shrimp dumplings actually disappointed this time around - my friend bit into one that wasn't fully cooked - fail.I'm still a fan of this place, but I guess this visit was just too near to closing time, and the service was lukewarm.

I had already made 6:30 reservations, so when we arrived and we got seated within 5 minutes and that was the end of the good service. We ordered drinks and our meals at the same time, I ordered the Honey walnut shrimp and my wife ordered the Orange peel beef and the street noodles so we were very surprised when our meal came out about 1 hour after we ordered, and the order was wrong., all that came out was the shrimp and the noodles no beef. I spoke with the waiter and explained to him the problem and he said he would take care of it. So we decided to start on what we had on the table, when I found out after my first bite of the shrimp that it was cold. I now ask to speak to a manager. When the manager came over I explain everything to him including the cold shrimp dish. Now the manager says he will take care of it personally and it will only take about 15 minutes or so, so again we wait. Now approximately 45 minutes later still no food, so I asked the waiter what was going on and he said he honestly did no know. So end of story we were there for about 2 hours and 10 minutes had 1 drink each a cup of soup and noodles and never got our entrees.Wait I forgot to mention that the manager said they would box up the beef and shrimp so we could take it home and that never happened .BAD NIGHT AT PF CHANGS in Chula Vista.",91915

We had the lettuce wraps but I like Cheesecake's better, I think because the chicken is in strips and here it is some kind of chopped up mixture. The lettuce is butter lettuce too at Cheesecake, can hold the toppings and sauce better!  For the seafood, the sea bass is the bomb!!!  Pricey but enough for two people!  I also liked the pad thai, just enough spice, but not too much that I couldn't handle it.  It's like taijin on fruit, it keeps you wanting more.  Service was great, even when I ordered for take out.  Staff greets you and asks if you need anything, and everything was packaged nicely.",91915

Twenty minutes passed, my husband looks at me and says, ""um, is anyone coming?""

I called over the first waiter who made eye contact with me and politely informed him that we had been waiting for over twenty minutes for someone to come and no one had. He apologized and said they were understaffed and blah blah, I think I gave him a look, like the ""and this is my problem because...?"" look, I didn't mean to, but naturally did it. He apologized again and said that he would take it upon himself to be our waiter. After that everything was smooth sailing! I wish I would have gotten his name to give him kudos in this review. He put in our order, brought out our drinks and was super attentive. At the end we got our check and he apologized again for the beginning (waiting for over 20 minutes).

We ended up having the reception at Panda Inn in Horton Plaza where the manager had no problem reserving their ENTIRE back dining room (seats 115 people) for us.

Polite, educated, superb menu knowledge, is one of the few servers who actually ""gets it."" I had the pleasure of speaking with Victoria-General Manager a few days back and highlighted a couple instances with my previous meal. Victoria was gracious and polite.  I now know why the staff is dialed in...it has a great leader!  Back to Jared. His total understanding of table attentiveness is evident. It just wasn't our table. He was steady with business and I noticed  he was perfect with other guests as well.  Trust me when I tell you I notice everything. He brought my son a taste of Egg Drop soup as my son had not had this before. He suggested menu items. He understands about course breaking so we can share food. The food in my opinion is always brilliant. Soups, Dumplings, any Shrimp dish, Sushi, Desserts...etc. I've eaten at this particular restaurant six times since I've returned from Las Vegas. My kids love this place and I'll be back.  Keep hiring the right people, Victoria! We haven't met in person but I hope to soon.

Cool, we'll just head over to the bar for some drinks...well, at least the drinks were semi-decent.Soon after, we were seated. We already knew what we wanted to order since we scoured the menu at the bar. Aren't we efficient? After reading all the reviews below, I realized that the salt factor in many of their dishes was off the richter scale. The dishes we ordered, on the other hand, were overly sweet. I expected that much from the Candied Walnut Shrimp (duh, ""candied""), but I didn't expect it from the Spicy Chicken Dish or the Garlic Noodles. Shame on me for thinking that the Garlic Noodles would taste anything at all like the ones from Thanh Long. Not even in the same ball park!! I took my side order of Garlic Spinach and mixed it into the noodles to infuse more saltiness but it only tasted salty, then sweet, then salty. Much like taking potpourri scented air freshener and trying to rid stinky kitchen orders with it--either way, you still smell the stench only now it's is slightly sweet with a delightful touch of apple and cinnamon. You catch my drift.Service was good at least. But God, the food gave me the worst stomach ache afterwards! No, it wasn't the drinks. I had the leftovers the next day only because I was too lazy to do anything but nuke food and once again came the dreaded stomach cramps. No bueno.Do not recommend. No way hozay.",91915

About an hours wait but past experiences have been that it was worth the wait. Service was a little slow. The waiter came over to take our order... it must have been a long day, no smile or introduction.  The food seemed to take forever to arrive which wasn't his fault, but his demeanor was almost rude. My drink was finished long before I finished my meal. Not once did he ask if we needed refills or if I wanted water until he brought the check. I asked for water at that moment. Someone came over and refilled the water glasses for the other family members at the table. When he came to pick up the check I had to ask again for water. He said that he would ring us up for the bill, never asked if I needed change. It appeared to me that he expected the change to be his tip. It was but don't assume. I never saw that requested glass of water",91915

What sets this PF Chang's restaurant apart from the others was the service. From our server, to the food runner, to the manager, everyone was friendly, attentive and super nice. This is especially outstanding because my family is kookoo-crazy! They are well-meaning, but totally frustrating to anyone in customer service.

It's not all that great. Everything just tasted really salty (to me). The desserts were ok though, they were placed in tall shot glasses, which I thought were cute.

Well, to pick up for take out you have to retrieve it from the bar. This would be normal if you didn't have your 6 year old child with you. I explained to the rep at the door I don't feel comfortable with my daughter entering the bar area for obvious reasons. She told me about their policy, which I didn't understand and informed me the only way to retrieve take out is from the bar. She didn't look like a manager but made sure I knew she had no authority of choosing a better option for paying and retrieving my take out. Well, I can't teach customer service but she probably could of talked to her manager to make an exception because there would be a child in the bar area. I am not sure if people think that way. I just wanted to let people know in the area how this PF Chang location takes care of customers. No, I didn't purchase the food. Yes, I walked out.

It was all mostly good and predictable for PFs but the soup was rancid and clouded our entire experience.  I kid you not, the soup smelled like ass, and we were all afraid to eat it.  the small spoon sample we did try proved it was bad. If I would have brought a sample for testing I'm afraid of what they woulda found as it was either tampered with or several days old..Hard to tell..What made it worse was the server had to tell the manager and it took him 15 minutes to come by and remove it the stinky bowl. He didn't even offer an apology or to remove it from the bill.  He simply shrugged his shoulders, and walked away.  When they brought out a fresh bowl of soup it was the way it is supposed to be, but by then we lost the desire to eat it, and may never look at a Hot&Sour soup the same way again.I know PF Changs is a good organization and their food is good quality. I have been to several of their eateries without incident and really liked it, but they dropped the ball and did nothing to make us feel good about the experience.  Management needs to step it up at this location.",91915

The 6 dollar 12 oz. bottled beer that my boyfriend ordered was warm and when we asked for it to be transfered into a cold glass it was seemingly an inconvenience.

Well, I LOVE the Fashion Valley Changs, but Chula Vista establishments in general fall way under par. All Changs has to do is provide decent, if not good service, and get the food out hot. I mean, the premise of walking into a chain is that you know exactly what to expect. From the moment we walked in the door it was a disaster. Here's my list of why it was so lame on a NOT busy weeknight:1. Although we were seated quickly the hostess was a rude young girl who acted as if we were bothering her. 2. We waited 10 minutes for a server to greet us.3. We waited another 10 for water! So thats 20 minutes with no water!!!4. It seemed like the young male server was waiting on his first ever table, on his first ever day, of his first ever job!5. The food...all of it was served luke warm!6. The waiter asked if we were interested in dessert. We ever so gently reminded him that we were interested in receiving the desserts that came with our pre-fix.7. He brought them out and we ate our dessert in the midst of our piles of dirty dinner dishes that were never cleared away.8. To top it off on the way out the hostess nearly pushed me out of the way in a near head on collision as she was seating other guests and as I tried to make a break for it a waiter had stopped to let me by and when I didn't say thank you in time he blurted ""Your Welcome!"" I swear my head almost exploded right there by the front door. We spoke briefly to the manager when he brought our wine. He said he used to work at Fashion. I don't know how he could have possibly handled the influx there and I'm pretty sure I know why he was transferred.",91915
2891,"2015 Birch Rd Ste 1401 Chula Vista, CA 91915",Isaiah N.,"San Luis Obispo, CA",4/2/2009,2,"I don't know what's up with the restaurants at Otay Ranch (read my review of the Cheesecake Factory there, and you will know what I mean), but in my opinion this PF Chang's location was also horrible. My party of five went to this location at a time when it was not too busy yet, so there was no wait time. And at least our waiter was courteous and professional. Also, depending on your taste of music (it's Top 40 format), you might like or not like the ambiance.Having said that, my group ordered egg drop soup, hot and sour soup, lettuce wraps, calamari, dali chicken, beef with broccoli, orange peel with chicken, shrimp with snow peas (I forgot what they called it on the menu), and dessert shots of tiramisu and smores.  Mind you, we got these items as a result of their ""dinner for two"" special and ordered two specials. On the side, my group also ordered double pan-fried noodles (the combo). Save for the desserts, everything that we ordered was downright SALTY. Heck, it was so salty in my opinion that you could give the food to a horse and it will just lick the salt. For me, it tasted like they used one whole salt shaker per dish. And that does not include the soy sauce, which on its own has a LOT of salt. As if that wasn't enough, the calamari also came with salt and pepper on the side. Hmm...I think I know why lots of Americans have high blood pressure and are probably really fat. Also, when the menu says a dish is spicy, it really IS spicy. I ordered the dali chicken ""mild,"" and when I ate it, I could feel the ""firecracker"" chili burn that made me sweat all over. There is such a thing as too spicy; I had to drink several glasses of water to alleviate the burn. Thus, based on my experience, I'd most likely avoid eating at this P.F. Chang's location again. Great-tasting food does not require a lot of salt.",91915

The cod was on a bed on spinach and was so soft and sweet.  My niece really wanted dessert and ordered glass desserts which was rather small but it only was $2 for that.  With my family, it sometimes gets difficult to find a place we can all enjoy and this is one of our go-to spots on Sundays.",91915

Considering this is supposed to be a supposed high end Asian fusion bistro I wasn't really wowed by the food.  The pros: great looking interior, very high class feel, bar seems fully stocked, and the staff was pretty friendly.  Now for the cons: if you attend this place on a weekend be prepared for a good wait.  We came in Sunday late afternoon/early evening and there was a stiff 45 minute wait.  Our party was given the option to wait at the bar and put our name on a list or just to straight up sit at the bar and eat there.  We opted for the bar area which had some small tables to eat at.  Our server was attentive and cleaned our table (which still had left over plates and glasses from the last party there).  She did forget to give us our silverware and cloth napkin.  Luckily for her our first appetizers didn't really require them since it was egg rolls, plus we had some cups of egg drop soup which also came with its own spoons.  Our party opted for the 4 course meal which started off with the things I just mentioned and the entrees: almond chicken cashews and Mongolian beef.  I have to agree with what other Yelpers have said...their food is SALTY.  Its like they put way too much soy sauce on everything.  Add to that the rice we got (white rice) came in two small soup cups.  There was three of us so that simply wasn't enough rice for us.  We had to order one more cup of it.  The portions (considering its a 4 course meal) were disappointing.  We finished everything but I could've ate way more to be honest.  For dessert we finished with a mini serving of New York cheesecake and something called The Wall of Chocolate.  They came in small shot glasses and we pretty much scarfed them down quickly.  Pretty creative and it was actually tasty.  Probably the best part of the meal.  The wait time between the appetizers and the actual entrees being served took a minute.  I had to guess at least 25-30 minutes before we got our entrees.  It was busy so I will give some understanding.  Sitting in the bar area I also noticed the actual bar seemed pretty stocked but I saw one small 15 inch TV playing a basketball game...REALLY? I know its not a sports themed bar but at least have one 40-50 inch TV there playing something.  One small TV in the corner is pretty disappointing.  All that being said, I would give this spot another try as I saw the honey walnut shrimp actually looked good.  Kinda disappointed we didn't try that.  Also the dessert alone may be another reason to come back.  I may have to steer clear of the beef and chicken dishes as it was just too much salt.  The bill for our 4 course meal came out to about $54, but luckily we had a $50 gift card so it was basically a $4 meal. Our server did a good job refilling drinks and attending to us...plus she was friendly and cute.  The small thing of forgetting the silverware was forgivable seeing how we didn't need them right at the moment...this wouldn't be my first choice for Chinese food as I think you can get better portions elsewhere but the ambiance, shrimp dishes, desserts, and drinks may drive me back here at some point.",91915

Maybe needs a little more lemon but I always ask for a side and add it myself. The quality of the food is good and fresh. My kids love the vegetable lo mein and the lemon chicken. My husband and I love the lettuce wraps, Kung pao chicken and the spicy shrimp appetizer. The beef and broccoli is better than any place I have ever had it. The hot ginger peach tea is delicious!

She never leaves us waiting which is the best deal. When you have little ones with no patience, this is a blessing! She is peppy and you should have her training everyone. I do also want to mention that the appetizer was not up to the usual standard and we mentioned it to Meghan and immediately the manager came over, spoke to us about it, looked into and offered to replace it. We ate it since it was still good just not as awesome as usual, but I love that they addressed it immediately. I think she said the managers name was junior. So thanks so much  we will for sure come back again and again!",91915

On the other kuài zi, whatever the origination or inspiration, the food is halfway decent. It's a bizarre takeoff on the mulligan stew of American cuisine.

Chang's out there in the world...so if you like P.F. Chang's, and you are in the neighborhood - you won't be disappointed here.  I live a ten minutes walk from this branch, and go for early lunches sometimes...and the food is fresh, hot, tasty, and served by a team of friendly smiling attentive people.  Furthermore the place is clean and situated on the outskirts of the mall so it is never short of parking.  What more can you ask for if you should decided to go to a P.F. Chang's?I'm glad this restaurant is in my community...now Achiote - that's a different story.  Achiote supposedly has authentic Mexican food...but who cares when you have slow crappy service???  Eating out is not just about the food...it is about an overall dining experience to enjoy your meal.  Right???",91915

Their Mai tais are sooooooo dang good! The bartender sure does make them EXTRA strong, so you get your moneys worth. Their not too fruity either. The atmosphere with the lighted candles on your table when your seated is amazing to. The food was cooked just right. The prices are pretty friendly. My hubby and I got the dinner for two special for 39.99. Included 2 soups, 1 appetizer/starter, 2 entrées, and 2 mini desserts. Can't beat that price! The mai tais were only $8.50.

Chang's Bistro; mainly the Otay Ranch location.  We dine there at least weekly for lunch and then generally twice per month for dinner.  We were very happy when this location opened. However, it had a rocky start as they just didn't seem to have their ""service"" perfected as we were accustomed to at the La Jolla and Fashion Valley locations.  They did eventually work out the ""kinks"" but the purpose of this email is to inform you of the huge transformation we experienced recently.We went to dinner at Otay Ranch on 8-31.  It was the busiest I have ever seen this location!  I noticed a young lady in a dress delivering the food to tables after their orders had been taken by a server.  She was right in the middle of the action.  Everyone was pleasant and working very hard.  We placed our order with our server.  The young lady, Ann Teal, delivered our food.  We had ordered Kung Pao Chicken and Pepper Beef and when she brought it to us we received Mongolian Beef and Pepper Beef.  We informed her that we had not ordered Mongolian Beef, but Kung Pao Chicken.  Ann immediately apologized, asked us to please enjoy the Mongolian Beef with her compliments and said she would get the Kung Pao Chicken out immediately.  She did not blink an eye or skip a beat and our Kung Pao was delivered promptly.  This was an example of ""Exceeding the Customers Expectations""!  Obviously your employees have been empowered to ""Make it Right"" for the customer and do it respectfully.  It is obvious the placement of Ann Teal as Operating Manager was a very smart move on behalf of P.F. Chang's.",91915

Food, even better than I remember!  Finally got to try the oolong sea bass and it did not disappoint.  As a party of 4, we also had street tacos, the chicken lettuce wraps (must say I do miss the presentation of the mixing of the dipping sauce ingredients, they no longer do that), salt and pepper calamari, moo goo gai pan (best ever!), a sushi roll (don't remember which, daughter didn't share), ahi salad, and raspberry chocolate wontons for dessert.  Hubs got something banana with some coconut ice cream which he LOVED.  Overall, I can't say enough about our experience last night.  We don't go out much so when we do, it's so appreciated when everything is not only good, but excellent!",91915

The lettuce wraps are good, but the rest of the menu just tastes pretty much the same thing is the same sauce.  And it is not inexpensive.   I think they are all about rushing you in and out, the server told us several times that she would get us out of there quickly.  We weren't in a hurry, but after about 30 minutes there, we were ready to go and find someplace quiet.",91915

We had a party of 8 (4 adults/4 kids). Now, I'm sure when restaurant staff sees some kids they groan but we waited for 20 minutes, were the only ones waiting, no one else came through while we were sitting around. We finally decided we needed to go elsewhere because after we checked in, we were pretty much ignored. I went up to the hostess and let her know that we were going to eat somewhere else and all she said was, ""Oh, ok."" No, ""Well, we're just about ready for you if you don't mind waiting for a few more minutes."" or ""Sorry you had to wait so long, hope you can come again."" That's just BAD, I didn't even sit down to eat and I know I will never come here again. We all know the food isn't worth it, my cousin has some special memories with his wife here and it was their anniversary so I obliged. We ended up walking over to King's Fish House.

Upon my most recent visit I arrived around 7 P.M. on a Saturday evening, which is probably the busiest time to eat at this establishment. Even with the large crowds in the waiting room, I was seated in just over 10 minutes. My server Lauren was prompt in ordering our drinks and appetizers, and both arrived within a short period of time. I have been abstaining from the consumption of meat during Lent, and there was a nice selection of Vegetarian and Vegan dishes. I ordered the veggie lettuce wraps for the appetizer. They come with sautéed tofu and won tons, and I was not missing the chicken lettuce wraps as the tofu was cooked to the perfect consistency and the sauce could transform any veggie or meat into an amazing dish. My Buddha's delight entree was a nice medley of steamed veggies that were just crunchy enough to retain their flavor. Lauren made sure to refill my iced tea every few minutes and was prompt in meeting our requests for condiments and other items. I must admit that her service is probably the main reason for this high score on yelp. I foolishly left my credit card at the restaurant with the bill. The next day I returned to see If  I left it there. Lauren immediately recognized me and alerted her manager to return the card to me.
