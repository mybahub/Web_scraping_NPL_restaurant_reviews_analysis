Jenni Eisenberg,Local Guide,86,4,4 days ago,"Food and service were fabulous. Women's bathroom was disgusting. I know it's hard to get employees but make sure you're keeping all areas clean and safe. Besides that, our server was great and our food was delicious."
Elaine Elefano,Local Guide,28,4,a month ago,"Coworker and I went for happy hour but I guess they don't have that anymore. We ended up just eating at the bar. Service was okay, but I wish they still had happy hour."
Khaled Abdullah,Local Guide,2,5,3 months ago,I think their food is very delicious and served hot and in a good timely matter. It‚Äôs my second time and I came back missing this food. Thanks Michael for this great experience.
Justin Floyd (CaliPapi),Local Guide,45,5,4 months ago,"This was a very delicious and delightful meal.  The atmosphere was so pleasant and calming, I've never felt so in tune with myself during a meal. More expensive Panda Express, but worth it definitely‚ÄºÔ∏è"
Suzette Villalobos,Local Guide,73,5,2 weeks ago,One of the better ones we‚Äôve been to and the waiter was very attentive
Jay Tweet,Local Guide,74,4,a week ago,"The service was amazing and the appetizers were good. The ginger broccoli chicken had no flavor and was super disappointing. The great wall cake was amazing, easily shared by two to four people."
David Krauss,Local Guide,93,5,3 weeks ago,"Been a fan of PF Chang's for years. Lots of  tasty appetizers to choose from, and reliably great drinks at the bar. Plus, there has always been a well-rounded selection of entrees. And isn't it nice to be able to eat in now that Covid ‚Ä¶"
Dots Davis,Local Guide,28,5,2 months ago,It was such a wonderful experience. From our waiter to the incredible food and our desert that they set on fire. They wear mask. Very good with distancing but you only have 2 hours and they will tell you it's time!!
Myrna Vasquez,Local Guide,15,1,a week ago,"Asked to be seated at patio since dogs are not allowed inside.. Waited 40 minutes because we were told only one server was available for outside, and could only handle 2 tables.  When a table was open, we were seated 40 minutes later. ‚Ä¶"
Josh Bottfeld,Local Guide,172,3,a month ago,"If you're looking for their happy hour, you won't find it right now.  There is rumor that they may bring it back sometime in the future but I would call the restaurant before going over there if that's what you are looking for. A couple of appetizers and to drink ran $57. The food is tasty. You can't go wrong with the lettuce wraps."

RAS Corner Johnson,Local Guide,15,5,a month ago,Wait staff was nice and the food was good I had the Spicy chicken my friend had the Duck. He didn't like his that much. Said it was not as good as last time. But this is my review so mine was 5 stars as was the staff..
Katherine Edwards,Local Guide,126,3,a week ago,"The food was okay. But, the original server acted as if he didn't want to work.  They had no straws for drinks. But the worse part was some woman got into an accident outside.  She was brought inside. She stood there ranting and raving with a bloody face. She sounded drunk. Should have been taken to the hospital!!!"
Let E,Local Guide,153,3,a month ago,"This restaurant was just ok. Overall the food was mediocre, this was my first time dining here.  The only good things I ordered were the shrimp dumplings and the Bao Donuts(which have to be eaten at the restaurant while HOT) or else they ‚Ä¶"

kyle C,Local Guide,127,3,a month ago,A little expensive for the quality however still good. But nothing that really separates a great hole in a wall Chinese store for maybe 1/4 cheaper and bigger servings.
