LN Garimella,Local Guide,6,3,4 weeks ago,"Waited 25 minutes over the pickup time accepted by the restaurant. It may be a one-off thing due to how busy they were.

Kavita Agarwal,Local Guide,25,5,a month ago,"Logan was the best server and enhanced our experience. So lively, caring and good natured. Also funny.
Their Buddha's feast was like none other. Well made with good ingredients. Great option for vegetarians. We also ordered the eggplant and it tastes better with skin on."
Darrell Wynant,Local Guide,221,2,2 months ago,Oh man... the food ruined my stomach. This place has changed! I simply got the orange chicken with white rice. The chicken seemed softer than usual and sort fell apart. I assumed it was because it sat in the container (ordered for pick-up) for about 10 minutes for the drive home. Rough.

Michael Mcfarland,Local Guide,41,3,2 months ago,The server made it an enjoyable experience. The food was delicious. The hostess seemed new at the postion. I was disappointed in the cleanliness of the floor and the windows. However we had a very good meal.
Thomas Oed,Local Guide,70,4,2 months ago,"Excellent food and service! Only reason it isn't 5 stars is that it a tad pricey for what it is, which is not a bad reflection on any of the staff. Everyone is super friendly and helpful!"
Gracie Mena,Local Guide,91,5,5 months ago,My son and I love PF Changs! They changed their Orange Chicken recipe. Too much breading so I asked for plain chicken (no fry). It tasted great!

Eduardo Perez,Local Guide,18,1,3 weeks ago,"Waited for about 1hr...they told us it would be about 30mins. Normally that is not a big deal for us, but we were waiting next to the front desk and ppl without reservation that came after us, got it in first. I felt like they were given priority because of the color of our skin, or what we were wearing...never going again ..."
Melissa Marcil,Local Guide,54,1,3 months ago,"Quality of food and service have gone way down , better to eat at a local mom and pop restaurant.  Big chain restaurants after covid killed the high end quality. Sorry to say, I've been going to this one for over 15 years, and a return visit is not in the future."
Dee S,Local Guide,106,4,4 months ago,"Celebrated best friends birthday,  good food & dessert choices.  Nice environment,  we dined outside with lamp warmer.

Alexis L,Local Guide,112,5,3 months ago,Honestly I have had better Chinese food at the local mom and pop shops. I even think Pei Wei is better than PF changs. Well until they took the blazing beef noodles off the menu

Vi San Diego,Local Guide,41,4,4 months ago,"PF Chang's is a high end Chinese restaurant..and of course the food is always delicious. Never had a bad dish here, and wouldn't expect otherwise.  Dishes are a bit pricey for sit down lunch..a good meal for 2 could cost you $100."

Eduardo Perez,Local Guide,1,1,4 months ago,La Jolla San Diego location the service was horrible. Spoke with a manager he didn't seem to care at all.

Ray Luo,Local Guide,5,2,a month ago,It was really hard to get hold of our waiter and we had to wait more than 30 mins to get our food only to find out THREE dishes were not what we ordered. Not to mention the food quality was a lot worse compared to before the  pandemic. It was a disaster for my family.
Neil Becerra,Local Guide,3,1,5 months ago,"Bad, bad, bad. I am staying at the Embassy Suites across the parking lot from PF Changs. Ordered a family dinner for take out. The order was placed at 6:32 p.m. and I was told that the order would be ready for pick up in about 30-35 ‚Ä¶"

Tim Rieches,Local Guide,48,3,5 months ago,If it wasn't for the lettuce wraps it would have been a completely wasted trip the orange chicken was to spicy for my daughter to eat and more breading then there was chicken

Brian Zuniga,Local Guide,73,3,a year ago,"We had edamame, Mongolian potstickers, shrimp tempura roll, and Mongolian beef. All of it was sub-par. For $70, we could have two tasty meals at the neighborhood Chinese restaurant. This was probably my last visit to PF Chang's. The magic is gone."

Susy Anderson,Local Guide,1,1,10 months ago,Staff is unresponsive and must always wait longer than time given. Not worth the trouble to come here.

Randal Plankey,Local Guide,35,3,a year ago,Went for lunch and the food was good but we ordered three entrees and portions were on the skinny side.
