Chang's yesterday for my parents anniversary and while the service was good, the food was just not hot enough. We asked a few times but they didn't really respond well to that. Hot and Sour soup was just warm and not hot. We used to come here often but idk anymore about multiple strikes the past few times.",90503
1,"3525 Carson St Ste 166 Torrance, CA 90503",Angela L.,"Torrance, CA",8/7/2021,3,"Came here only because we got a goft card...lets see....we had a reservation so we didn't have to wait...i suggest getting a reservation online otherwise you have to wait a lot. Ambience was very nice, service was great and attentive. For appetizer we ordered the first sushi roll on the menu and the dynamite shrimp. Sushi roll was good but the dynamite shrimp was honestly not good at all....for entree my husband got the galbi NY strip steak that comes with roasted potatoes peppers and onions and brown rice...meat was tender, sauce was nothing special but they did not ask how qe wanted our steak cooked so it came out medium...a bit overcooked for our taste but at least it was tender. They should ask for cooking preference for steaks though.I ordered the lo mien with pork. Good flavor but nothing special, reallyFor dessert we ordered the flaming fire and ice...it was a bread pudding w vanilla ice cream coated in dark chocolate dome and flambed with rum...good flavor but the bread pudding was too wet....made it seem that fhe custard was undercooked....overall it was just an lk experience...",90503
2,"3525 Carson St Ste 166 Torrance, CA 90503",Leo H.,"Ontario, CA",7/16/2021,1,We stopped by one of my favorite spots to eat Saturday    Made reservations for 4pm got here and wait about 10 mins to be seated that was the 1st strike....  so the hostess seated us outside we sat there for about 20-30 mins with out nobody asking did we want drinks or anything that was the 2nd strike....  so I had to get up and ask for the manager and explained to him we have been waiting 20mins with no service so finally a guy comes to the table with a look on his face like he don't want to be working so he started saying they pulled me from what I was doing to come help y'all but I'm not the one that works outside I work inside I don't really want to be out here but I will take your order so that's the 3rd strike....  so I tell him if u don't want to serve us you don't have to ok for one you should never tell a customer anything like that so I tell him to leave I get up and get the manager and tell him what was said so he sends some else over by this time I'm pissed off and ready to leave but I'm hungry so we just stayed and made the best of a bad situation with drinks...  I been here a few times and had little problems with mixing up orders but the customer service here is terrible and needs to be fixed ASAP a waiter should never act in the way he did or even say the things he said to a paying customer so I paid $400 for bad service cold bland food and a complaining waiter... this is one of my favorite spots BUT I WILL DEFINITELY NOT BE RETURNING TO THIS LOCATION AGAIN....,90503

At 7:01 pm restaurant emailed me ""your table is waiting"" and confirmed 7:30 pm time. While traveling there (on Uber) restaurant called and said they can't honor online reservations and said that I should have phoned in the reservation. They said they could accommodate us in their outdoor unheated area.   We canceled the reservation and dined at elsewhere. Very bad PR.",90503
4,"3525 Carson St Ste 166 Torrance, CA 90503",Sara R.,"Ontario, CA",3/26/2021,1,Terrible!!! We came in for a birthday party and they would not let us sit at the table!!! 6 person ... We had one person running late coming into town. They made they rest of the party wait untill this one person came in!!! We had to wait over 35 mins just to sit for our reservation! By the way they were not busy at all!!!,90503
5,"3525 Carson St Ste 166 Torrance, CA 90503",J S.,"Hawthorne, CA",3/5/2021,4,"That thing happened to me that I've been dreading for the past year.  Getting hungry during the pandemic yet not feeling up to cooking...but wondering about food quality.  Yes, today I got burned to the tune of $40Although I saw people eating along the patio when I arrived for pickup, bjs food looked so much better (and their quality didn't suffer much over the holidays).  Another thing that looked strange was why were four female employees huddled around the hostess station.Anyway, I get my food home and notice the crab Rangoon hasn't changed.  Now my combo rice and dumplings are another story.  The rice had little taste with big chunks of fatty mystery meat throughout.  No heat, savory, umami...nada!  I ordered pan fried dumplings and only one side had a noticeable sear.  The rest were steamed and the shrimp filling tasted like ground haddock.  One was completely inedible because...someone didn't clean the grill.  Pictured are pieces of burnt charred particles, which are actually dangerous to consume.Wish I'd gone to yelp instead of Google, where this place has 4/5 stars.  Next time I get a Chinese food craving, I'll head out to thai dishes in Manhattan beach.  Same price, better quality.",90503
6,"3525 Carson St Ste 166 Torrance, CA 90503",Carlos R.,"Los Angeles, CA",8/29/2020,5,"Outdoor sitting which is the new norm! Tables are scattered, so the the normal is ""almost there"" The service is excellent our waiter is very attentive and does give us a rundown on the menu and the whole situation. Hand sanitizer, space given! Only outdoor seating which was more comforting. The orange chicken was exceptional not dry it felt straight from the kitchen. I also got the chicken lettuce wraps, rice and lomaine aka noodles. The only thing I tried that was new to me was the bulogi steak  with potatoes. It was good it was medium done and it was tender not dry or chewy. I felt comfortable eating outdoors still with the feeling you have to be aware of your surroundings but it's what we have to adapt too now. Lately I have been tipping more than usual just cuz I know the waiters/waitress and cooks have been in the same fight as all of us making ends meet. So tip your servers people!!!",90503
7,"3525 Carson St Ste 166 Torrance, CA 90503",Lucky S.,"Downtown, Los Angeles, CA",6/20/2021,1,Its father's day dinner we called for take out.We called to request for a reservation but they said they are not taking tables for tonight. Got to the restaurant to pickup takeout and only 3 tables occupied and whole restaurant is empty.Worst food ever we paid $85 dollars. If you go to a small Chinese restaurant that offers $1 item they have better food. See pictures. Kung pao chicken just fried chunks without any flavor.Fried rice mostly white rice mixed with some only some veggies.Orange chicken is also just fried chunks without any flavor.This place is rip-off.Called back to complain but nobody got to the phone for 15 minutes Don't waste your time and money and better go to a family run place where they actually treat you like a paying customer.,90503
8,"3525 Carson St Ste 166 Torrance, CA 90503",Paulina N.,"Hawthorne, CA",10/2/2020,3,"My bf and I went on a weekend day, and they had just started outdoor seating the weekend prior. Wait time was 45 min to 1 hr, but they were actually able to seat us fairly quick. I would recommend making an appointment so that you can get one of the booths that are covered; as those are reserved for reservations only. (It'll be less windy with a bit more privacy). The food was okay. Nothing too spectacular. This is a place that I would come to once in a while, but probably not very frequently. I'd probably avoid coming with a big party too since the food can be a bit pricey for big groups and the portions aren't very big for you to share.",90503
9,"3525 Carson St Ste 166 Torrance, CA 90503",Jakai L.,"Redondo Beach, CA",5/26/2021,5,Rude place they cut help so much they have al these empty tables yet make you wait and to top it off tel you to go outside and wait I mean I get it because f Covid but you don't have to be rude They tell you they are waiting to clean tables,90503
10,"3525 Carson St Ste 166 Torrance, CA 90503",Matthew M.,"Los Angeles, CA",5/3/2021,3,"This chain is a perfectly acceptable option for Asian food if that's what you're craving and need something reliable. The miso lobster dumplings are exceptionally good and flavorful. As far as entrees are concerned I would steer you towards the shrimp in lobster sauce. It's silky, sweet, earthy, and salty all at once. It goes exceptionally well with white rice. Their brown rice was a little dry and bland which is a risk with any brown rice preparation. Chang's spicy chicken is ok. It's didn't have as much sauce as I would've liked to lubricate the rice, but the chicken pieces were well cooked. You're going to find a variety of dishes ranging from various cultures with the American palette considered quite heavily.",90503
11,"3525 Carson St Ste 166 Torrance, CA 90503",Alex L.,"Redondo Beach, CA",11/29/2020,1,"Avoid ""Miso Glazed Salmon"" - the 'Asian mushrooms' that are part of the dish apparently came undercooked which I didn't realize until next day I got hit with super bad allergy all over my torso, back, shoulders and neck. Looking up the symptoms revealed I've got ""shiitake dermatitis"" - a rash following the ingestion of raw or undercooked shiitake mushrooms.",90503
12,"3525 Carson St Ste 166 Torrance, CA 90503",Christina C.,"Hermosa Beach, CA",4/8/2021,1,"The food here is good however our meal was ruined tonight. They use door dash and we received our order with a missing item, my dinner. They said they would refund us but that they could not have one delivered. The food is 4 stars but the missing item brought it down to 1.",90503
13,"3525 Carson St Ste 166 Torrance, CA 90503",Brittany S.,"Redondo Beach, CA",6/20/2021,3,"3rd time here. Very inconsistent. Last time we ordered the flaming desert for the kids to watch her melt and burn the whole thing in many attempts to light it (we were inside). Then she just goes, ""oh well. Here ya go."" And walks away, leaving us with a burnt pile of moosh. It was a dud. No replacement for the failed fire desert. Alrighty then lol. This time was decent. The drink was really good. If get it again or try making it at home. It was a nice refreshing flavor. The food is quite pricy for stir fried with tons of rice. We ordered the steak rare, to have it come out well done. It's extremely tiny too. The higher the plate cost, the smaller amount of food you get. The roll was interesting, but I'll stick to actual sushi restaurants for that kind of thing. Of each experience, none of it tasted fresh. It all tasted like reheated leftovers. Our first time we got a bunch of different plates and shared. The mushrooms and all seafood were chewy like rubber. Soups were quite small (mostly broth) and these huge plates of white rice I guess to fill you up. The sampler was skimpy as well. The things I DID like besides the mojito were all the sauces they put on each dish. Can't remember all of them but there were 6 of us who all ordered different things to share. I'll take the mojito as a win but won't be back unless someone else invites and insists on going there.",90503
14,"3525 Carson St Ste 166 Torrance, CA 90503",Jen K.,"Torrance, CA",4/26/2021,4,This is one of my favorite place to eat since they opened this place. I'm disappointed they don't have the Shrimp with honey dew that's my favorite there. I like their Lettuce wrap and eggplants it was so good!,90503
15,"3525 Carson St Ste 166 Torrance, CA 90503",Marcelle M.,"Redondo Beach, CA",6/28/2021,2,"I don't know if this restaurant got the memo about opening with new health orders but seems they are still in midst of pandemic. Got there at 7:17p on a Monday and was told they close at 8p so wouldn't seat us. Trying to be understanding of businesses challenges and still wanting to support local I asked if I could order takeout. Was directed to bar and placed order. Was told, that due to Covid I could not wait inside restaurant (although there were tables eating inside) and had to go outside. She asked my name and said they would bring it out. At 7:50p no food. Had to go back inside and from the taste of the food, it had been sitting for some time. Cold and soggy. But a patron arriving at 7:50p got sat. It will be long after further restrictions are lifted before I try PF Chang's again anywhere.",90503

I had the crispy honey shrimp. On the way home we both felt sick & we both passed out. Not too sure if it was the food or if there was a lot of MSG added. We both had the same symptoms - extremely bad headache, swelling in the face & nausea. My friend recovered faster, while I was unable to eat today. Sadly, I had left overs & as much as I'd hate to waste food, the remains were tossed.",90503

21,"3525 Carson St Ste 166 Torrance, CA 90503",Adeeva M.,"Los Angeles, CA",1/28/2020,5,"Me and my sister came here to eat dinner before going next door to catch a movie at the AMC. It was a Sunday around 5pm so it was about a 20minute wait. It's in the outdoor plaza area of the Del Amo mall so there are a lot of people around and parking is typical mall parking. The inside is a bit dark but that's at all PF Chang locations, it's a part of their aesthetic.We ordered the Long life noodles and prawns, a side of fried rice, Brussels Sprouts and Crispy honey shrimp. The long life noodles are a must order, the flavors in the noodles are amazing! I've never been too disappointed by P.F. Chang's food. Service was great, and the food came out relatively quickly. Great restaurant for groups because portions are for family style eating. Everyone order something different and prepare to feast!",90503
22,"3525 Carson St Ste 166 Torrance, CA 90503",Kyoshi H.,"Torrance, CA",5/10/2020,1,"Ordered online pick up for Mother's Day for 3:45PM. Promptly got their 15mins ahead to find a line that wrapped around to BJs. There was no communication between staff and customers on what was going on. Customers that were already standing there in line for hours had to relay messages to other people coming in for their online orders. Their staff was incompetent after the crowd started getting aggressive because they were speaking so quietly amongst the situation of your orders were 2-3 hours behind on your actual order time. Figured I've already waited here an hour and a half before the said something, I might as well wait it out. Another hour goes by and other aggravated people went inside to find out what's going on, and turns out they decided to CANCEL everyone's online orders and were basically doing ""walk-in"" orders. Which meant I would've probably stayed in line another 2hrs, then however long it took them to even prepare the food. Thanks for making a horrible Mother's Day experience. Get your act together on these incompetent employees.",90503
23,"3525 Carson St Ste 166 Torrance, CA 90503",Tyler F.,"Torrance, CA",7/3/2021,5,This is completely irrelevant to the food. Recently I lost my wallet and I contacted here if I might of dropped my wallet. Luckily I found it in my car. I personally wanted to thank the staff for taking the time to search/inform the employees if a wallet was returned. Also for wishing me hope I'll find it which I did. It brings good fortune in my eyes and hope people can see the staff caring. Thanks again.,90503
24,"3525 Carson St Ste 166 Torrance, CA 90503",Yosmar J.,"Los Angeles, CA",5/21/2020,2,"I have never ever been so disappointed in a restaurant than with this P.F. Chang in Del Amo Mall. I placed a Mother's Day order in hopes that I would be picking it up curbside as they highly recommend it when I call and through their website. I placed my pickup for 6 guest at 3pm and therefore arrived about 10 minute ahead of schedule should I have to wait a couple of minutes or so (I knew they would be a bit busy). As I arrived to their front drive in their so called ""curbside"" none of their team members seem to be assisting curbside drop offs. I approach a team member and ask where I'd have to pick up my food. Her reply is that I would need to get off the car and make a line ( already a red flag, defeating the purpose of curbside pickup and waiting) I see that there is about 30+ people waiting in line all which had ordered for curbside. While waiting in line, I decide to call them to see if they would be able to meet me outside in the line should my food be ready. I'm placed on hold for about 35+ minutes thinking that someone would answer my call. The call drops because of the overwhelm calls they receive. I waited in line for over 4 hours. I saw that their competitor was very much organized and even met their customers in the front drive. While I saw NO P.F. Chang team members outside letting ""us"" (people in the back) know what we were in store for. Not once did I not see the operations manager: Ashley step out and apologize for having us wait in line or offer water to those that were waiting for hours ( I mean all of us) there was a senior couple that had been waiting with me for ours for their lunch and that was honestly heartbreaking. Unorganized line: The lines was very unorganized. Ashley did not bother to force the rule of 6 feet and social distancing. People at the entrance of the restaurant were all squeezed together trying to find answers on whether their food was coming out or not. Del Amo security did not bother wearing a face mask nor enforcing social distancing. ( photo attached). After waiting for 3 hours to make it to the front of the lines, I noticed MANY people inside the restaurant. There was probably about 25+ people all crowded speaking to different team members. Once again Ashley did not care for enforcing the law . Food: I thought that waiting in line was the end of it. I was informed that despite having ordered my food online, I would have to make another line and they would pull up my order to make it fresh. That was a lie unfortunately. Food was sitting there for a very long time before it reached the hands of a client. My food was cold and incomplete. I had ordered food for 6 people but instead was given food for 4 people. The rice they gave was a joke, about 1/5 of the size of the container was full. When I tried calling to asked what had happened, they never answered Management: It is clear that this restaurant cared a lot about their money and despite being 2-3 hours backed up they were still receiving online orders. The way Ashley manages her team is unacceptable and very unprofessional. She was not only rude to customers but also rude to her team members. I could hear her yelling at the kitchens from the bar area. As I mentioned to her, managing is not only leading a team, but also taking ownership and having customer service be your number one priority. Should she had been a lot more involved with the clients that had been waiting outside, maybe some of us would of understand. She was rude, unprofessional and really needs to be committed to her team and the people she serves if she want to be in this industry.   I would never treat my team not customers the way she treated them today. I very much hope that this is a learning experience for all PF Chang restaurants as they set their teams up for failure. This was a issue at every P.F. chang restaurant in the United States. Update: Jessica from Customer Affairs from PF Changs reached out to me and would like for me to give P.F. Chang's another try. I'm looking forward to dining in with them as soon as they allow it. Until then I have added another star as they very much care for their customer feedback.",90503
25,"3525 Carson St Ste 166 Torrance, CA 90503",Sam V.,"Torrance, CA",1/12/2021,2,The one negative thing about takeout and delivery during COVID times is that we can't check the food. We ordered Beef with Broccoli. The beef came out extremely burnt to the point that it visibly resembles jerky.

They reopened two days ago for dine in after being shut down due to Covid. We enjoyed the food and our server was great. But the main dishes took quite a bit longer than we wished. They weren't very busy so I don't know why it took so long. But what was worse, our food was almost room temperature when it arrived at our table.

I haven't been to PF Chang's since my last visit at their Pasadena branch years ago, but I had a great experience in their South Bay location. I came in with coworkers to celebrate a birthday, and I'm glad someone suggested PF Chang's. It was a quick luncheon but it was memorable.

Needless to say it was very underwhelming. I guess those low ratings are there for a reason. I always thought it was over priced but was good. Not anymore!!

It was chilly!! Our waiter Jose was Amazing! He really tried make us comfortable, brought us tea and warm wipes. Honestly if it wasn't for his excellent service we would've left. To the Manager, you need to be prepared for any circumstance especially with these new restrictions All of the restaurants around us were equipped with canopies and heaters, they even had extra!! Could you not have borrowed them to make your guest more comfortable? Word to the wise, ask that all of your hot food be brought at once so you can enjoy a hot quick meal.",90503

Finally, I called back and someone came out with the order. When I got home, I noticed I was missing dishes that I had ordered. I paid nearly $100 for this horrendous experience. I called and spoke to the manager. All she would offer me is a $22 refund and a couple of $10 gift cards. They have so much nerve to think that I would use these cards. I would have to spend more money there to use them. I will never EVER return to a PF Changs. If you can't fulfill a service correctly, don't offer it!

So we left to come back and while waiting for someone to check us in, got the 4th text. The manager came out and said I'm so sorry someone must have pushed the button or something which makes no sense cause the 4th text came to me while we were standing there. She said she still had 3 groups ahead of us so we'd still have to wait which if your restaurant messed up, which I have proof of, do something to fix it. I know the groups in front of us didn't get the text so if you say our table is ready, you should either follow through with what your restaurant messed up on or offer a solution of some kind. 2.5 stars for this location now makes sense.",90503

My aunts and I arrived at this location in Torrence off Carson Blvd at around 4:15 p.m. and was told there is a 30 minute wait time to be seated. We had NO issues with that because I'm a frequent guest at PF Chang's. I gave my name and phone number to reception and we went out into the mall to wait our 30-35 minutes. About fifty (50) minutes later my aunt asked ""you still haven't received a text message yet?"" It was at that point I realized it's been MORE than thirty (30) minutes since we've been waiting and so decided to return to reception. We returned to reception only to find out there's NO table available. Without ANY apologies from the African American girl (wearing a green sweater) We were asked to wait in a small room on the left hand side of reception. About 3-4 minutes we were escorted to a DIRTY table that we had to clean up before sitting down at our table. Even the African American hostess said ""I thought he said this was a clean table?""Please be reminded we requested a booth and NEVER got a booth. The food as usual, is what I have come to expect from PF Changs . . . Tasty and delicious! This was my two (2) aunts FIRST time dining at this establishment and the ""Customer Service and Dining Experience"" was below expectations, substandard and lack luster. This is not an experience I want to remember for a long time. I take comfort in knowing my aunts did enjoy their meal and was bellyful. We are ready for the check to pay for our meal. I gave the waiter an email I received with a promotion for my birthday, thinking this was an easy, seamless and user friendly transaction, our waiter made this transaction PAINFUL and a HASSLE. I was able ask for and get a manger after about a five (5) minute wait for a manager one African American lady approached and asked how she can helped? After sharing with her our HORRIBLE dining and customer service experience, this manager offered us a dessert on the house. I/WE WILL NEVER RETURN TO THIS LOCATION IN TORRANCE!

It lessened our expectations but nothing could save what followed. We ordered Mongolian beef, which is usually really hard to mess up, but somehow they did. It was not flavorful at all and they didn't even bother to cut up the onions so they weren't overwhelming. The honey shrimp was also disappointing. It also lacked flavor and honestly, Panda Express can compete. If you're looking for a better experience and food with better taste for half the price, head to Mandarin Kitchen down the street.

If it is just two of us they usually have a deal like changs for two where you can have a three course meal for like $40. Whatever you are interested in at any chinese place will be good here. I love their mongolian beef and always get that. The kung pao chicken, crispy honey chicken, changs spicy chicken, and broccoli beef are all great too.

The happy hour menu is great deal and we don't need to to sit at the bar area to do that. Some of our favorites are sushi, dumplings and spicy & sour soup for starters. For entrees we love steamed fish, walnut shrimps, Mongolian beef and Korean chicken stir fry. Fillers I recommend lobster & shrimp fried rice and Hokkien rice noodles, also vegetarian fried rice and garlic spinach sides. For desserts we love chocolate dome and New York style cheesecake, a lot of cocktails are very refreshing and tasty. There are still tons of other yummy items on the menu that we have yet tried them all but will eventually, Keep in mind there is a gluten free menu available too. The service has gotten a lot better recently, servers are very attentive and much faster than before.

I've been to several of their over 200 locations and my general impression is about the same for all the locations. I don't want this to seem derogatory but I can't help but think of P.F. Chang's as a sort of upscale Panda Express. P.F. Chang's offers a lot of traditional American favorite Chinese food choices and adds some improvements in food quality, offers more beverage options, and provides a sit-down dining experience. The presence of forks and knives as the default entrenchment tools was a hint that P.F. Chang clientele will not be using chopsticks, though there was a box of chopsticks at the side of the table.Lunchtime on this Thursday was relatively quiet. I opted for one of the lunch ""Wok Classics,"" the Korean Chicken Stir-Fry, which had no further description on the lunch menu. There was a decent amount of chicken but the chicken was somewhat on the dry side. There was some mild chili sauce in the dish but it wasn't enough of a liquid environment to make up for the dryness. There were lots of vegetables which were all good, green beans, red peppers, carrots, and onions. The side of white rice was a disappointment, not very starchy and plain tasting. This dish was labeled as spicy but I would consider it as very mild when it comes to spice. Overall this was an average dish and I'd probably try something else next time.I also ordered a couple of pieces of Crab Wontons. These turned out very nice, with a nice crunchy shell and a good tasting crab interior. The sweet chili dipping sauce was also a winner.I will also mention that the non-alcoholic beer they serve was very good. There are not too many NA beer brands out there and Erdinger is one of the best.Service was prompt and there were no excessive delays. The restaurant was a little on the dark side, which isn't necessarily a bad thing on a hot July day.",90503

Basically other customers who were in line were informing everyone in line what was going on.  What type of customer service is this? And then to find out the workers were lying to everyone only saying they were 2 hours behind on orders when in reality they were 4.5 hours behind on their orders.  And after waiting 2.5 a couple that was behind me told me that the restaurant wasn't doing any online orders and only taking orders people placed at the door.  WHAT THE HECK IS WRONG WITH YOUR STAFF!

Not like any other egg drop I've ever had.Orange Peel Chicken - doesnt look very appealing and small portion for over $16. Doesnt have much taste and kind of dry.Lo Mein Chicken - looked and tasted good. Could use more chicken but otherwise met expectations. Honey Chicken - looked great. Tasted bland. Has the crisp but not enough honey taste.Mongolian Beef - Too many green onions in ratio to the beef. I didnt pay over $15 for onions that I can grow in my backyard. But the beef was good.Sweet and Sour Chicken - the best dish of the night that met and passed my expectations. Almost could have fooled me for a perfect sweet and sour pork. Loved it.Rice wasnt served in bowls even though they gave us 2 small rice bowls alongside our 2 serving bowls. The wait was terrible. We reserved at 4pm for 6:15 but got seated around 6:45. But the waiter was great at his job and even helped switch out my mom's birthday option with something she isn't allergic too. Superb service there. All things considered, the food was less flavorful than expected. I rather go to Asia Kitchen or Mandarin Kitchen for better quality and quantity (depending on the food). -Like the sweet and sour was high quality but low quantity.-I expect to finish eating the main food and be full, not finish the main food and then keep on eating bowls of rice.So over all I give the experience a 3 out of 5 stars or 6 out of 10 if you like that. Probably wont come back unless someone else is paying. It's just way too expensive.",90503

Really cute girls!We ordered the new curry with tofu and kung pao with tofu. It was enough food to split with 3-4 people so we had a lot of left over to take home for two people. The small cheesecake dessert seemed like this little itty bitty thing but when you start to eat it, it's quite a bit. We had a coupon that was valid from November 3rd til the 7th. For whichever reason it was not allowing the discount to our order and there was no note on the coupon saying what the coupon would exclude.

It started off with Ricardo who brought our drinks then took our order. From that point I guess Kaitlyn was our server. She NEVER asked if we needed anything. I asked for waters and she dismissed me and NEVER brought it. In fact it was given to the couple next to us! She never once acknowledged us. Ricardo was busy making drinks for the tables. Kaitlyn continued chatting with everyone around us and helping them but never did one thing for us. We even had to ask Ricardo for water and for our check!

This last visit was a bit of a fluke. They ran out of kid menus and crayons so my two crazy kids had nothing to distract them. Not a huge issue but I didn't bring with me since they always have it. The waiter was very nice but overwhelmed. I ordered a wonton soup to share but only got one bowl.. it was tough to flag down someone to get me two more and then that guy forgets so I'm not thrilled while soup getting cold. Afterwards service was great and food very tasty. I really love the beef and broccoli with fried rice. Soup is huge and can be shared easily. It's on the pricier side for Chinese so my expectations are higher hence only 3 stars.,90503

The ambience however is lovely and cozy. The waiters were really nice. We ordered pad thai which was kind of over salty. Also stir fry pork and broccoli which was decent. I feel like I am able to get these dishes in any other chinese food restaurants because there really isn't anything that makes it worth so much more in P.F. Changs. Their asian caesar salad is pretty darn good. Servers are attentive which is a plus. I wish I can add more thought into it but I really can't because it's just pretty much overpriced food you can get somewhere else that's cheaper.Dare I say it, I'm going to take the walk of shame to Panda Express.",90503

The food quality of the same dishes has also declined. The eggplant usually has a lot of sauce but was very dry this time. I'll give them a couple more tries but if this continues I'm going to find somewhere new.

The food is overpriced and basically garbage considering how much money you're paying for this food.This is my second review of a P.F. Chang's restaurant but this one is in Torrance. I had the Kung Pao Chicken (they also have a Kung Pao Shrimp that is expensive and sh*t tier). They deep fried the chicken and didn't even grind the peanuts. It was $16.99 before taxes (Santa Monica location was $17.99).It was pathetic. You know why? I actually prefer the Kung Pao Chicken at Panda Express. Panda's spicier and has more flavor. If the P.F. Chang's Kung Pao Chicken was just like the Panda's Kung Pao... but less vegetables and more meat and they grind the peanuts like they do with Thai food? I guarantee you it would be a better dish. WiFi did not work here as well just like the Santa Monica location. Panda Express has WiFi places that work all the time. WTF is up with that Chang? Obviously there is no quality control.Restaurant was clean tho and staff were friendly. I hope every P.F. Chang's just closes down honestly after eating at two different locations.,90503

It was a true toss-up between these and Cecilia's Shrimp Dumplings. The waiter made a wonderful drink suggestion for me. I was thinking red sangria and she suggested the Blackberry Spice Martini  .

Went on ""free sushi day"" and to celebrate a birthday. Birthday offer was a free appetizer coupon (in an email in phone) so we asked the waiter if it could be combined with the free sushi offer and waiter said no. We politely asked him to check with the manager and the manager said ok. Meal went downhill after drinks came. Free California roll sushi was... meh... but it's free. Could have had more flavor and more sesame seeds. Waiter asks for the free sushi coupon (which isn't needed per the offer details) and we show one on the phone. He asks for the code on the coupon and we write it down. Ordered lettuce wraps as the free birthday appetizer. In the ""secret recipe"" lettuce wraps the seasoned meat is mixed with light and crispy rice sticks (maifun). The rice sticks in our order were stale like they'd been cooked and then left out for 2 hours. I've prepared rice sticks at home (for Chinese chicken salad) so I'm familiar with how to cook them (and how they should taste). But the meat itself was tasty so we were going to let that one slide. However...Lunch bowls come out. Fried rice in one bowl is just that... fried... rice. No seasoning, hardly any egg, and just a couple of toothpick-sized slivers of carrot. Other items are ok but not outstanding. Waiter now says we must have a free sushi coupon for each guest (which wasn't the procedure last year) so we find coupons (photo to follow) on our phones. We're still finishing the lettuce wraps and have lots of meat left over so we ask for more lettuce and drink refills. Waiter disappears. He comes back three separate times (why??) to get us to write down each person's coupon numbers (off the bar code)... one... at... a... time but forgets the lettuce and drinks. He acts annoyed with us but he could have waited to get all the coupon numbers and saved at least 10 minutes. Lettuce arrives about 20 minutes after our request but by that time food is cold and aren't hungry any more. Our waiter ignores us after that (we see him helping other patrons) and we ask for management to intervene. The wait time from ""lettuce request"" to getting our check was 45 MINUTES!Summary: disappointed with service and handling of coupons. This offer is widely advertised and procedures should be explained to servers ahead of time so customers aren't inconvenienced or made to feel like they're imposing by asking for the promotion.

Placed an online order at 3:35pm on Mother's Day for 5:45pm delivery in hopes of having food by 6:30 with anticipated high volume delays. Got a message from DoorDash at 5:40 that my dasher was en route. I checked my status on my order confirmation from P.F. Chang's and their status said ""pickup in progress.""  Sweet. Looks like my family was going to be getting dinner sooner than expected. Wrong.  The P.F. Chang's status never changed. In fact it stills says ""pickup in progress"" as I write this review two days later.  My door dash status had ELEVEN different dashers assigned to my order with the status of ""en route"" or ""at restaurant"".   At 6:30 I began to get nervous that my order might not be coming so I attempted to call the restaurant for a status. It rang busy nonstop every time I tried.  The one time it did answer, it was a recording and then the call dropped.  And then it happened, I received a text from doordash that my order had been cancelled AT 7:00!!  Instead of enjoying a nice stress free Mother's Day dinner with my family, I was frantically trying to figure out dinner for my now starving children on a day where restaurants were already swamped.  Carl's Jr. to the rescue. Just the scale of dinner I had always wanted on a special occasion.  Mother's Day ruined. The kicker, opened my credit card statement this morning and guess what, I still got charged for the meal that never came. Now furious is an understatement!! I will never set foot in this restaurant again!!!",90503

They have a lot of delcious happy hour food that I really enjoy.I've always been a fan of their lettuce wraps and at happy hour you can get this at a discounted price! I've tried both the chicken version and the vegetarion version. Both are very good. The chicken one has diced chicken with mushrooms, green onions and water chesnuts while the vegetarian one consists of tofu instead o chicken.I also like the crab wontons. It comes with six pieces of crispy wontons filled with creamy crab cream cheese inside.I recently tried the Chang's bbq spare ribs. It comes in a set of four. It's a messy bbq concotion with a spicy twist on the ribs.The spring rolls is a classic take on egg rolls and very good when eaten right away while it's still hot.My favorite of all the happy hour appetizers however is the crispy green beans! They give so much of the hot, fresh and crispy green beans! It comes with a side of spicy sauce. The crispy green beans here are some of the best I've ever had. The batter is tasty and not too salty.

Changs in quite a long time and since it was my birthday, my family insisted on going out tonight. They let me choose the restaurant and I chose Changs, since it had been awhile and I wanted something different. I didn't realize  that it had been so long, because when I looked at their menu, there were a lot of things that I loved that were no longer on the menu. I was especially in love with the lemon pepper shrimp, but surprisingly, that was no longer on the menu. I asked our server Andrew, who was amazing by the way, if they could still make it and he went to go check. He came back and told me that they are still able to make some of the old staples that used to be on the menu, however my beloved lemon pepper shrimp wasn't one of them. For appetizers, we ordered the salt and pepper calamari and the green beans. Both were good, but I was surprised to see that the ""salt and pepper"" component of the calamari dish was on the side. It looked like sea salt and cracked pepper. So you basically have to dip a piece of calamari in the sauce, then dip it in the salt and pepper. Otherwise, the salt and pepper mixture won't stick to the calamari. When we ordered it, I thought it would be seasoned, but it wasn't. Without the seasoning on the calamari, it was plain tasting, but it wasn't nasty. It's decent either way. Would I order it again? Probably not, but if someone else does, I would eat it. The green beans were good and I like the sauce that comes with it. We also ordered the shrimp fried rice, but it just didn't taste that fresh to me. Plus there wasn't enough shrimp. That in itself was very disappointing. It wasn't worth the price difference between regular plain fried rice and the shrimp fried rice. We also ordered the pepper steak, which I enjoyed and the crispy honey shrimp, which I didn't. That shrimp had a funky breading on it and then that breading had the honey flavor on there. It was like the shrimp was fried and then tossed in that sauce, but the shrimp wasn't fluffy and easy to bite into like shrimp should be. It tasted as if it was fried too long or perhaps sat too long before it was delivered to us. It just wasn't tasty at all. Nothing was really hot or smoking like it had just come out the fire. It was fairly warm, but not hot. I'm not super picky, so I didn't make a big deal out of it. But after thinking about it later, maybe if it was hotter it would have tasted fresher. Our server Andrew was fantastic and very attentive. He boxed up the food and offered to give me my birthday dessert, but I was too full to indulge. I would probably go back and try something else, but when I think of chinese food, P.F. Changs would not be my first choice.",90503

The brown rice was a little hard and not enough of it to accompany the chicken. I thought the chicken was pretty good though. Tangy, sweet, and crispy.

I have to start with my server Ricardo, if the food was not good I would still give 5 stars based on his service alone. He was very attentive. His drink suggestions were on point after asking is what type of drink we were craving for our palate. He was all smiles and very patient with my indecisiveness. I ordered kung pao chicken my favorite and it did not disappoint. My husband had the sweet and sour chicken he enjoyed it with no complaints. I had to ask for the sauce trio that I was used to them bringing automatically. I would definitely return soon and ask to sit in Ricardo's section.",90503

However my last visit kind of left a sour taste in my mouth, especially when you're paying $15-18 for a dinner entree. Our drinks took about 20 minutes to get, and the wrong entree was brought out for one of our guests. The dinner service was really slow for a Wednesday night, so not sure why service was a miss. The crispy honey chicken is the only reason I still keep coming back. To finish our visit, the manager charged us for the wrong table and then had to double charge us for our actual check.

My order was supposed to be delivered at 3 however when the driver told me a 2hr wait I decided to pick it up myself because the person on the phone said it would be better to do so if I could. Once I arrived there was no one communicating with the angry hungry mob in front of the restaurant. People started to take matters into their own hands and entered the restaurant and overwhelmed the manager so she stopped helping from the front door. Security was no help. Once I finally got our food it was ice cold meaning that it had been sitting there for hours but no one allowed an effective communication so that we could get our food on time. They weren't two hours behind preparing because there were hundreds of bags of food sitting on the counters waiting to be picked up but they were too busy trying to refund angry hungry people. My Mother's Day surprise was ruined but I do have to say they were trying to communicate but the crowd got out of hand...,90503

We were told our food would be ready in 200 mins 8:37pm to be exact after placing the order at 5:15 (3hours). We still placed order and that was Would be our dinner for the Evening. When we arrived for pickup there was a long line of people waiting. I would find out that they too had placed orders online some even as early as 3pm and still were waiting on their food. This was absolutely ridiculous and unacceptable. I was told along with others my food was not ready and they had no ideas when it would be ready so I like others security cancel my order. My family was hungry and I was pissed. I had drive 18 miles as this is the closest P.F. Chang's to me only to not get food. Having waited that late other restaurants that we were consider for a second choice where closed so we had to settle on drive thru takeout for mother's day dinner. It's safe to say I won't be back to P. F. Chang's for a while if at all. I'm so disappointed and wanted to let you all know. This should not have happened. The manager should have anticipated the increased volume and prepared accordingly.,90503

So to have had such a bad experience came as a shock to me. Tonight I made a reservation for 7:15. I was seated at my scheduled time but we were not acknowledged for the first 10 mins. Waiters/waitresses walked right by us and we were not helped up until a young man approached us and apologized for the wait & told us he would help us. Ray noticed that we weren't being helped so he took initiative and took our table even though he wasn't supposed to be our waiter (ok but where was our waiter??? Never showed up). We place our order with him at 7:25 and our food showed up until 8! Ray did approach us and apologized and said that he spoke to a manager and that they would comp out our food. We were content with that but we just wanted to eat. We saw 2 tables that were seated after us that got their food first than us and let me tell you their group was far larger mine, I was with my boyfriend. Anyways our food comes out and mine doesn't look familiar so I asked Ray if mine was Chang's spicy chicken and he says ""No, it's the orange chicken"" I return my entree and say ""I ordered Chang's chicken"" he takes it back and says it'll be 2 mins. My boyfriend didn't want to eat his food because he wanted to wait for me but I told him to go ahead and eat (I knew my food wouldn't be out by then, and his food would get cold). 10 mins later I get my entree and my boyfriend is just about done. Once we finish Ray comes around with a tab for us (????? Why?? When he said our food would be comped out because as he said ""it's unacceptable that you have to wait this long""). At this point I'm confused, I look at the tab & now I have to pay $27 for an order that firstly I waited a total of 45 mins for, secondly I was promised would be comped out. We appreciated Ray and all he did for us but why promise something if you're not going to keep your word? On top of that no manager showed up to apologize or do anything for us. We got an employee discount and that was it. We'll never come back to this location. Now, what was my favorite place, I'm now skeptical about continuing to go to any location.",90503

Customer Service : was horrible. We were served our food, which is served on a larger family style plate. We weren't given plates, forks, nor spoons. It took 5 min to flag someone down. Now I know the place closes at 1100, but if they are taking my money I deserve a decent dining experience. Now to my recollection food is packed up by waiters/waitress. Well I was handed 3 boxes and a bag to pack my own food. I'm sitting there watching a waiter at another table pack up someone's left overs. The Food: Quality and quantity is equivalent to Panda Express. No Lie!!!!  The portions are supposed to be  family sized. That is not True. It's equivalent to a cut up chicken breast that's cut up in small pieces.  Mongolian Beef over cooked. Chang's spicy chicken taste like generic  Orange Chicken. Fried rice lacked flavor and presentation.  My boyfriend thinks this happend because we came in near closing. Regardless we paid full price and I left deflated.  We decided that we won't be back.

Their website clearly states it is allergy safe(see photo). So either they are potentially making customers sick or the manager doesn't know what's in their food which seems crazy for a chain this big. The manager could not explain why the website said they were allergy safe or why no one had said anything about this on any previous orders.

I get it. It's a constant job but there were honestly 10 tables. My brother is a server and said that wasn't even close to being busy. Once we were sat and ordered and started getting our dishes, TWO of our dishes were obviously forgotten and came out (only when followed up upon) after we were already done eating. We also didn't receive utensils until we asked for it 2x. The guy we had was nice enough but still..Food: mediocre. Some of it was decent (Mongolian beef, crispy honey chicken) but way way way overpriced for the amount. Ambience: it was fine if you're ok with being in the dark. Overall, spend your money elsewhere.

I ordered the sizzling beef which now comes with tiny pieces of overcooked ""meat"" with more than half the dish consisting of celery! For $17 I don't expect filet quality meat, but that dish should have cost $7! The Kung Pao Chicken was littered with peanuts - which I understand are part of the dish, but not the ENTIRE dish.

Now that's truly a tragedy. ---Parking: Mall parking lots - there should be plenty of parking spaces during non-busy hours. ---Environment: One of the few finer dining environment for the Chinese cuisine. Service was okay, but don't expect waiters / waitresses here to speak Mandarin or Cantonese. ---Food: Singapore Street Noodles ($8.95) - Probably the best dish I had for this restaurant, but it's still at best okay. (3/5) Asian Grilled Norwegian Salmon ($15.95) - Think of this way, you are paying about $16 for a cooked, unseasoned salmon. Just think what you can do with $16 if you are eating at San Gabriel Valley (SGV). (1/5)Wonton Soup ($5.95) - Wontons were okay, but broth tasted like salt water. I'm gonna get high blood pressure if I finished the whole bowl of soup. (1/5) ---Rating: The longer this place is still in business, the more quality food will go to waste.

After a while we noticed people who came after us were being seated so we confronted the waitress which we found out were were put on some other list. Aside from the error and no appologies, we were quickly seated as their form of remedying the situation. Ok...whatever, crappy first inpression but moving on.Cleaniliness of the table: 5Restroom: according to my wife was a 5 however mens restroom was a 3 since it did have slight odor.Wait time per plate was an average 3-4 minOrder of food: 4 which means it comes in order of appetizer to entrees.Waitress/service: Excellent lady with glasses with a no nonsense type attitude and very quick with exceptional follow up and observation.Decor/comfy : 3.5 this is because the cushion on the seat were too lumpy allowing it to be slightly uncomfortable if sat long term.Volume: Medium. What I mean by this is if you order 2 entrees its pretty filling with the rice. Tea: 4, it was slightly light but very good and came in its old fashioned steel pot.Food - 4 due to starchiness and after taste which kinda of promoted more drinking of water rather than enjoying the dish in reference to short ribs. (picture) with the exception of calamari.  This was served with slightly spicy vege on the side which gave it the kick to the flavour.The kung pao shrimp was excellent. Slightly garlicy but lightly crisp , the dish was best out of all 3 dishes we had ordered  including the egg soup.Calamari was 1. It tasted gummy as if its been sitting there for a long while. There was no crunchiness not even a slight. Quite frankly it was near disgusting.Overall, I would come back however probably wont order calamari again.",90503

The service here was the worst service I have ever experienced. The restaurant was not busy and to me it seemed like the staff was too busy chatting with each other. We were there 2.5 hours waiting on food. It took 30 minutes to get our drinks and even the waiter understood the lengthly wait and tried to compensate with some no charge food but that didn't help.

For the first time, I found some raw part at the end of the skewer after I chewed into it. I had undercooked chicken before so I know the texture. I told the manager or the server and they offered another one. The second one of course was still undercooked after one or two bites into it. They did offer a free spare rib after the second incident but they never checked up or sincerely apologized about it. They just joked about it like it's nothing. You don't joke about raw chicken being offered to your costumer because it might make someone really sick. This morning (today) I started to feel uncomfortable in my stomach of course. I'm expecting nothing serious and I sure hope that I will feel better later today.Also, plates aren't served all at the same time but I guess since this is an Asian restaurant I can let it go. But we did order our own plate since it was a company dinner. I got my entree 10 min after everyone else and ended up not liking the dinner (maybe I just completely lost my appetite after the raw chocked). So I'm sure that I won't come back again.",90503

Seemed odd that the manager was so concerned, he had the waiter tell us to move instead of telling us himself.  Also strange that we were not told this when we first sat down, but half way into our meal.  Note, not a single waiter came anywhere near our table the entire meal.Third, all our dishes were extremely salty, as others have previously reported.Lastly, when ordering, I specifically asked the waiter whether the sesame chicken, crispy honey chicken and orange peel chicken were crispy - I told him I only wanted one of those dishes if really crispy. He said the crispy honey chicken was crispy, so we ordered it.  Needless to say, 3 orders of crispy honey chicken later, we still had not tasted chicken that was actually crispy.",90503

The food came in a timely manner, but he was nowhere to be found when we needed something. We waited and waited and finally had to ask other staff to help us (menu, water, extra napkins and to go box). He also, messed up with the billing. He fixed it, but it took which seemed like forever to get back to us.As for the food, I thought it was delicious, but I could probably get it somewhere else for cheaper and better. And no, not from Panda Express lol. I dislike Panda. Their food gives me a weird after taste. PF Chang's is definitely better than Panda lol.We had the Four Course Pre-fixe menu, which I highly recommend. $39 for 2 people and you get soup, an appetizer, entree with rice and a mini dessert. Lots of food and worth the money. We hadAppetizer: CHICKEN LETTUCE WRAPS- Very yummy. A tad too salty for my taste, but the lettuce makes it better.

Recently I had to manage a reservation of people for a birthday. We were 16 Deep, and the Birthday Girl wanted some PF Changs and some Happy Hour Dranks.So after work, we rolled in, got our seats and began to order. As the Drinks came in, the waitress clarified that Happy hour didn't apply to large groups inside the restaurant, only to the bar and patio area. Wut? Are you serious? She was, and the whole tone of the party changed. We had discussions about how management didn't understand the concept of Happy Hour, and another coworker explained how she worked at a restaurant that did something similar and how it made it harder for waitstaff, because they had to deal with pissed off customers, constantly. This is a dumb policy, because if we did get happy hour priced drinks, we probably would have gotten buzzed and ordered more food. We decided right then and there that this was the last time PF Changs was going to get our big, group business. We celebrate things all the time, and we are lucky that there are many restaurants in Torrance that can give us what we want, if PF Changs can't. Oh, so the Food was good, but not a good value.

It was my birthday so I did not pay but my three friends felt that the service was not tip worthy.

It's now a general Asian feel with not only Chinese, but also Korean, Japanese and Vietnamese. They now serve sushi, and albeit, it's not very tasty - the menu makes it sound irresistible. We also ordered the shaking beef, cashew chicken, spicy green beans and the crab fried rice. The rice had chunks of crab and was so tasty! Loved the green beans as well for a chain restaurant. Next time I'll just be ordering those with a beer. For all of this, the total was around $70 for three people.

We ordered the Singapore Street Noodles which were really good. They were tasty and full of fun vegetables that were also very tasty! Although the plate was really great, the pasta wasn't as soft as it should be in my opinion. The Sesame Seed Chicken was delish especially when getting a side of honey sauce (please do)! The Shrimp Fried Rice as typical as it may be, it was pretty good.

We finally got our table and our server came and we could barely hear him, he mumbled and spoke too quietly. My friend wanted sake but they were out and I wanted Sapporo and they were out of that as well. My friend asked for no ice in her water and it came with ice. It took forever for the server to come back to take our order. Meanwhile multiple servers were helping the table next to us and laughing and having a great time. Our dumplings finally came and they came out cold. Long story short it took us 2 hours in here when it wasn't even busy and had mediocre food.

273,"3525 Carson St Ste 166 Torrance, CA 90503",Derek K.,"Yokohama, Japan",7/21/2014,2,"Rating: 42/100 ptsThere was a time, before I had left my suburban, upper-middle class hometown in South Florida, when I naively thought PF Chang's to be ""supreme Chinese food"", and more significantly, considered it one of my favorite restaurants. Oh how much seeing the world changes you!Throughout my college days, I'd typically come with a group of friends or family and share some combination of the Lettuce Wraps, Chang's Spicy Chicken, Mongolian Beef, Dan Dan Noodles, Kung Pao Chicken, and Honey Shrimp. And although it had been a while, I recently dropped by the Del Amo Mall location, more for nostalgia's sake than for a good meal.Yes, the food tastes good. After all, it's Chinese-inspired food engineered to be physically impossible to be disliked by Americans: heavily marinated morsels, a dominating emphasis on sugar, only the lean pieces of meat (white meat for chicken, non-fat parts of beef and pork), and a striking exclusion of vegetables. In other words, almost every last ounce of genuine Chinese culture has been squeezed out, and prices thrust high.By no means is eating here is a terrible experience, though. The interior is suave, the staff is consistently polite and attentive. In fact, the Mongolian Beef and Spicy Chicken are admittedly darn good, and will definitely satisfy (if not subjugate, if you are used to eating real Chinese food) your taste buds. Moreover, it is a good place to come with people who'd rather stay in their culinary comfort zone, but who want a change of pace from your average steak or pizza.I suppose the biggest difference between the LA locations and the location in my hometown is the fact that most people from LA have access to better Chinese, whereas the folk in suburban Florida (and perhaps most other parts of the nation) do not, and interestingly I find this directly impacting the way they perceive the value of the food here. In Florida, you'd need to make a reservation, and STILL end up waiting a while. At this one, you can usually be seated right away.With this in mind, if you, the reader, have yet to experience and/or make up your mind about their food, you can now consider yourself properly oriented (No pun intended, I promise): this is yummy Americanized Chinese food that is luxuriously overpriced.",90503

I still love them! There are a few locations out there that are not up to par (Bakersfield, CA come to mind), but this location in the Del Amo Mall area is very good. The service was super friendly the food was not over salted (a great danger when American cooks use soy sauce), and as always, the prices are reasonable.

Very small portions and the orange chicken wasn't very good. The broccoli beef was ok. We did order vegetable fried rice and this was probably my favorite out of the entire order. Wonton soup tasted fishy. The egg rolls were very basic. Maybe best to dine in for better quality.,90503

While most people complain of them being overpriced and serving small portions, l was hopeful that happy hour would deem otherwise. And it was not bad!!! For just a little over 20 bucks before tip, dude and i shared:Crispy Green Beans- much bigger than anticipated! They give u plenty and it's served with a spicy sauce (i got some ginger dressing on the side also)- however it's WAY too much batter. I prefer lightly battered green beans- this one used a much heavier batter, probably what they would use for battered fish.  yelp.com/biz_photos/2GIp…Their signature Chicken Lettuce Wraps (makes 6 wraps)- i prefer romaine for lettuce wraps- they use regular old iceburg here- but it was still enjoyable. I would have liked more veggies in the chicken mix- it was a little bit too saucy/salty. I liked the water chestnuts for texture.  yelp.com/biz_photos/2GIp… Tuna Tataki Crisp: (comes with 3)The crispy wonton discs were the best part per dude.  Comes with seared tuna AND fresh diced tuna and sesame seeds and scallions with spicy sauce on top. It was good except for that it was infected with star anise in the spice rub on the edges of the seared pieces.  yelp.com/biz_photos/2GIp…Battered Mahi Mahi street tacos= didn't care for the tortillas they used which easily fell apart. Fish was good.  yelp.com/biz_photos/2GIp…  Mini Great Wall of Chocolate. A shotglass of chocolate cake with frosting, which tasted exactly like Hofs Hut Chocolate overload cake but with smaller chocolate chips. Which isn't a bad thing. Service was good. I probably wouldn't rush to come back for anything other than happy hour and if i had a giftcard again.",90503

My two go to entrees are the sweet and sour chicken the the Mongolian beef. The sweet and sour chicken is terrific and the Mongolian beef is awesome. If I had a choice and I could only pick one  then I would probably have to go with the Mongolian beef... It is bomb!        The food may be a  bit more pricey compared to other Chinese joints but to me that's ok because the food taste good. The happy hour is pretty good  with some decent prices on drinks and appetizers. I have to deduct a star for the fact that I can pretty much guarantee that PF Chang isn't back in the kitchen cooking up my Mongolian beef and pork dumplings.

They tasted no different than the Costco frozen ones. Actually, they tasted worse and SALTY!  We had a chicken spicy soup. The thing tasted like water with can tomato, and SALT!  The only thing good was our entree, the spicy chicken.  Their employees were less than enthusiastic, the hostess literally just walked us to a table and mumbled something. The waiter was ok except for one thing, he didn't remember to ask us if I wanted my dumplings steamed or fried.  Another thing, I thought their prices, are too exaggerated for the quantity and quality!  Needless to say I was extremely disappointed with the food more than anything, so I don't think we'll be back.",90503

I feel bad for every single server, busser, bartender, and cook that has to work here. What a nightmare.We arrived on time for our 6:30 reservation and were handed a pager and told to wait. ""How long?"" ""20 minutes, we have no tables."".... I get it, Mother's Day is busy, but what is the point of a reservation, then? We stood by the hostess desk for 30 minutes and that's when things really got interesting.4 girls working the desk, every single one of them rude and incompetent.- As people walked up, everyone got a different story. Most were told 1:30 to 1:45 minute wait without a reservation. Some people asked about the patio and were told the wait time was the same, others were told the wait for the patio or ""first available"" was only 30 minutes. - Another woman came in with a reservation saying she requested a booth because someone in the party could not sit at a table (I forget the reason). The girl said they would not be able to give her a booth because they were too busy. She was told it was ""at least"" 30 minutes to sit her at a table (not booth). Again, what was the point of the reservation?- Another family said their pager never went off, and the hostess blamed them and accused them of shopping in the mall which was out of the range of the beeper. When the family said they didn't leave the area of the restaurant, the hostess replied they must have gone shopping and blamed it on them. They had to wait even longer for their table. - My favorite part was when 4 parties all walked out at the same time. A hostess said in a flustered way, ""I have no bussers!"" and proceeded to stand at the hostess desk looking over the shoulder of the other 2 girls posted at the desk, then stood by the dirty table staring at the dirty dishes. Go bus the table yourself then!Finally, a hostess comes to us and tried to get us to go sit outside on the patio in the cold/drizzle. Nope. We wait ANOTHER 10 minutes for our table, which is sitting there unoccupied, but no one can be bothered to go over and bus it.When we sat down, we met our awesome server, Andrew. He was so nice and upfront with us and told us right away that there would be a 45 minute wait for our entrees since the kitchen was backed up. Obviously it was backed up because the hostess overbooked the restaurant. He also said they were slammed with takeout orders. Now that is just bad management. If your restaurant is full of hungry, pissed off people that waited 2 hours for a table and another hour for their food, why are you even accepting takeout/delivery orders?Andrew and our other server Ben really tried to make the best of it, bringing out an appetizer ASAP and making sure our drinks were full as we endured the wait. I do not fault them for anything. The manager spent the entire evening going around apologizing to angry customers, but not actually doing anything to make the situation better. Lesson learned--never trust this place to run competently on a special occasion. Such a joke.",90503

My friend was raving that the Mongolian beef was her favorite dish and shared pictures on her social media. It looked delicious and I wanted to try it, so I ordered it after contemplating the Filet Mignon medallions. Brita recommended both as her favorites but since I wanted to see what my friend was raving about, I went with the Mongolian Beef. When I tried it, it was hard & crispy, and nothing like it looked in my friends pics, so I asked Brita and she said they shouldn't be too crispy, and asked if it was overcooked. I prefer my steak to be medium rare, or medium at most, this was WELL DONE. Didn't really taste anything exciting either, so after speaking with her manager, she put in a new order for us. It came out a little softer but not worth trying again. Disappointing. Our Fried Green beans were greasy but good, at least. I love authentic Chinese food and this is NOT it. This is overpriced, American Chinese wannabe food. Had it not been for Brita our Easter dinner would've been a FLOP.

However, that was the only thing our table liked.  The ribs were so overcooked and dry.  Very tough even to cut with a fork and knife.  Spring rolls were greasy and I still don't see how the sauce paired with it. We had a couple of beef dishes, one chicken dish, one noodle dish and one veggie.  All the dishes had way too much sauce and everything tasted quite greasy.

Besides not following up on the fact that we did not get our complimentary sushi roll, (we had to ask her 3X)   she  also misled me about getting the PF Chang credit on my order, she told me that when you scan the barcode that was on the coupon that we had from my email, that the order will know right away your loyalty number, she was totally wrong, and it was only when I went a second time and the waitress DID know how to do things correctly and input my number and I got an email stating the number of points that I realized that I did not get the points I should have gotten the first time and had to call the company to get it (it was a large order of  $49) but since I paid half with girt cards and half with CC if I did not have the credit card receipt, it would have been a whole lot more hassle.   Given the quality of employees I have usually have at PF Chang's, I am surprised that they have an employee so disorganized and forgetful (she even forgot the fortune cookies!!)  and it was annoying that I had to spend a longer  time hunting down the receipt and calling the company to straighten this out because she lazily preferred giving wrong info to me than spending a few moments to ask someone if she did not know the correct info.",90503

337,"3525 Carson St Ste 166 Torrance, CA 90503",John S.,"Frisco, TX",4/3/2016,2,"It pains me to write this because the food was satisfactory and I realize the server who was asked to cover for our original one took over her screw up, but it took an extra 20 minutes for my daughter's S&S Chicken, probably the easiest and most common Chinese dish on the planet, to be prepared and served after the other three meals were brought out. Asking a father and mother to eat their meals while their young daughter sits and watches us was totally embarrassing. What made it worse was the floor manager's repeated passes by our table, seeing our frustration, and not offering once to head back to check on my daughter's meal. The young man who took over our table for the girl server who conveniently went on break just before this fiasco obviously did not check to see if the entire order was being prepared, resulting in me having to return my own dish while I waited with my daughter for hers. To expect any loving father to engage in a meal while his daughter sits waiting for hers is a total breach of restaurant etiquette; unless they were intentionally trying to create a teachable moment for me by showing my daughter what a guy should never do on a future date. I appreciated the general manager coming out later and comping her meal, but the rest of our night was blown. I would not recommend anyone trying to make a movie time at the AMC next door to dine here - the risk is too great. Maybe my next visit will be different; if so, I'll be happy to upgrade my review.",90503

Changed menu from a year ago for the worst. Service beyond bad! I'd rather save the money & aggrevation & go to Panda. RA Sushi is equally as bad. Many other restaurants better in walking distance.

We finally decided to leave so I ask the manager that do to the long waiting if he could take of my bill the two mojitos that we had order. He then answer very rudely that he could not do that because it was against the law and that he could lose his job.

342,"3525 Carson St Ste 166 Torrance, CA 90503",Cat L.,"Hermosa Beach, CA",8/15/2008,5,"NOTE: This review is really for the service more than anything. If you hate PF Chang's, you will probably find a reason to hate this one, too. I personally like PF Changs, esp. their crab wontons and honey shrimp with candied walnuts and honeydew balls. Oh, and the fact that they custom-create your dipping sauce tableside. So, they get 4 stars in my book, plus another for the excellent service at this particular location. Our expectations were exceeded and we walked away happy, and that's what really matters.Jon's birthday fell on a boring ol' Monday this year and by the time we decided to go out that night, a lot of places were already closed for the evening, or closed just because it was a Monday. What a lazy beach town we live in! We figured we'd head out toward Del Amo where a lot of the sit-down dining options were located, including Denny's (if we absolutely had nowhere else to go). Since Jon could eat fried rice for days, he suggested the nearby PF Chang's for dinner, and luckily, they were open pretty late (like 11 PM). Score! So no need to resort to Denny's...DOUBLE SCORE!!Our waiter, Joshua, was completely on the ball that night. We agreed afterwards that we hadn't seen service like that in a long time. He really went out of his way to make sure we were taken care of. For instance, we couldn't decide on white or brown rice so he brought out both, and even packed up hot batches of fresh rice for us to take home with our leftovers. How sweet is that?? Coupled with the fried rice we ordered on top of that, we had rice coming out of our ears but us rice-lovin' Asians weren't complaining. ;)I suppose I should also mention that our waiter packed up our leftovers for us, which Jon says usually doesn't happen at other PF Chang's locations. I can't confirm this but I do know that even at finer dining establishments, they usually hand you a styrofoam box and plastic shopping baggie and go HERE, DO IT YOURSELF. So, either way, not having to clean up after ourselves was a plus.The real highlight of our evening was when our server brought out a diverse and colorful selection of mini-desserts for Jon's choosing. If you are lucky, you usually get an incredibly condensed (like 2 or 3 option) DESCRIPTION of what you might have for your special birthday dessert. Here, we got TANGIBLE VISUALS, which are almost as preferable as tastable ones. Each dessert was individually assembled into these adorable little shot glasses and the one chosen by Jon (The Great Wall of Chocolate) had a candle tucked into the center. I noticed a lot of restaurants don't really do anything special for their birthday customers anymore (See my review of King's Hawaiian Restaurant), or they've drastically downgraded from offering a substantial dessert to a shake or smoothie. I'm glad there are still respectable restaurant chains that continue to put in that extra bit of effort to make their customers feel appreciated.Josh, if you're reading this, thanks again!!",90503

I am in the hospitality industry myself and every time I go to Changs I leave not only with a full tummy but a wow experience. She knows me by name, by the time I fully sit down my drink is already in front of me, not only that her recommendations are on point. Today I went in after a stressful day at work, had a cold Kirin draft beer. Miss Monica knew I wasn't having a good day without me telling her my food order she said ""I know what to get you"" minutes later some dumplings and then a nice tasty wok filet gets placed in front of me. She not only knows that's my favorite but also brought out the sauces I order it with.  It was busy at the time I was there but she always checked up on me and all her guest were really happy! I managed to speak to an older gentleman with his wife and they said the only reason they go there is because of Monica! I've tried to bring her over to my job but she seems to be really loyal to Changs so this girl needs a raise. I will always come back as long as Monica is working there.

This isn't your $5 corner Chinese fast food place so it's not ""fast"". The food here is good quality and kind of pricey, again not your $5 place. The seating is plentiful but it gets pretty crowded in the evening, so waits can be long. They have all your popular Chinese dishes like Kung pow chicken, chow main, egg soup, wonton, beef and broccoli, fried rice, you get the picture. But it's fresh made food, it hasn't been sitting all day under heat lamps, supposedly. I am in the middle of 3 and 4 stars because it is a chain and I've had plenty of home cooked Chinese food and small mom and pop restaurant Chinese food that is better than this.

I don't eat much of anything here anymore other then the spring rolls or Chicken lettuce wraps as I just dont think the food is good enough to warrant the price.

Today I added an appetizer of spring rolls (2 for around $4). I got the broccoli beef and it was delicious! The garlic was noticeably present and the ginger was zingy without being overpowering. The fried rice was fluffy, the rolls were hot and crispy, and the soup was perfect.Bianca, my server was excellent.

Flash forward another 20 minutes.. we are still waiting for our food and decide to ask another waiter if they know where our waitress is, because we have not seen our waitress since the time she checked up on us saying that our food would be out shortly. Soon after, our waitress comes with my food, finally!!!!!!!! my mom tells her about how long we have been waiting and she apologizes. (we think she may have forgotten about our order, and tried to hide in the back so she wouldn't see us, but who knows maybe they were just extremely busy... although we did see other customers who arrived and ordered after us get their food)but still no sign of our other dish. She says our other dish should be coming out right away. Before our second dish arrives, the manager comes up to our table and apologizes for the wait, and says he will take one of our dishes off the bill.

He was eager to answer any question about potential dishes and informed us that, if we selected wrong, he would let us know.  He also advised me which drinks had the greatest alcohol content, and that will earn any restaurant at least two stars from me.  My cousin suggested that we order family style and I think that's the only way to go.  We ordered five dishes and the two that he selected - Chang's spicy chicken and the shrimp with candied walnuts - were the best ones on the table; sweet, savory, and the very definition of Chinese food for American palates.The others were good, though not quite as impressive.  My husband ordered peppered steak extra spicy, and, while I think the amount of spice was appropriate for Chinese food, there was an odd aftertaste that became more pronounced when we ate the leftovers.  The sweet and sour chicken was a little tangy for me, but preferable to the too-sweet versions that I've had elsewhere.  The one dish that I was dissatisfied with was the vegetable fried rice.  It was oily and significantly lacking in flavor.  It was a great night, though, and I was in great company.  My advice:  bring the right people and order a lot of food.  And find my mysterious waiter.  He was awesome.",90503

I ordered this dish here and thought it was going to be the standard thick gravy-ish topping for your rice, but instead ended up being in a bed of broccoli with fried tofu on top. WTF? Who puts broccoli on mabo tofu? Where's the red sauce that's it's supposed to be in?Okay so I tried it and boy, was I happy that I did! This is not your standard mabo tofu. There is some kind of sauce that flavors the tofu and broc that I can't explain. It goes so well together! Definitely my favorite dish there to date. A must have!All the other dishes were okay. The tofu lettuce wraps and veggie dumplings were mediocre (although the waitress-made sauces made it taste better).. nothing to write home about.Service is typical.

There were slivers of some type of vegetable...couldn't make out what it was though.1 App (Lettuce Wraps)Fresh leaf lettuce was the star of the show, unfortunately.  The chicken was cold and rubbery, and had a heavy dose of soy sauce and not much else.  2 Entrees (Honey Crisp Chicken + Sesame Chicken)Honey Crisp Chicken was good.  Juicy chicken that was lightly battered and fried, doused in some really good sauce that wasn't too sweet...I liked it.  Sesame Chicken was horrible...again, lots of soy sauce and tons of ginger with not much else.  The veggies were good, though, especially the broccoli.  The brown rice was...well, brown rice.  Tough to mess that up! :)1 Tiny DesertWe opted for the Blueberry Cheesecake...pretty damn good.  We wanted to order another slice because the serving was so tiny...about 1/4 the size you'd get at Cheesecake Factory.Service was great, but the value was horrible.  The price should be $20 or $25...but $40?  Come on, P.F.

(face it folks, NY has the best!)I walk in and the atmosphere is like a upscale Ruby Tuesdays. They have a nice looking bar and I'm guessing this is the local after work hangout? (Also, you have to drive here, there is no A/C/E train in Torrance)I ordered some Sake and Chang's Spicy Chicken. The food was ok, It wasn't anything to jump up and down about.

We were all out and about enjoying the day shopping and decided while in the area of Torrance to hit up the P.F. Changs near the Del Amo Mall. The food and service was mediocre at best. When it came time for the bill to be paid a friend gave their credit card but left a tip in cash. What did the staff at P.F. Changs do? They wrote in an additional tip on the tip line so in fact they were double tipped. That is not only wrong that is called a crime and hopefully the management see's this review because it is being forwarded to P.F. Changs Corporate. P.F. Changs is lucky it wasn't my card because I would have filed a Police report, subpoenaed closer circuit/surveillance equipment from inside the establishment and figured out exactly who took the bill away and who wrote the tip in. This is totally unacceptable and just be advised that when you eat here if you are leaving cash make sure you line through the tip line or write cash in the tip area.

We were just looking to quench our desire for a little Chinese food. It did that! And the service for take out was exceptional. She said the woman who helped her (Sharda) could have taught a class in customer service - she was that aware and extremely helpful.And to our surprise, when we opened the bag at home and took out the food there was an additional item hiding in the bottom with a note that read  ""Here is a little something sweet to thank you.

I ordered the Japanese eggplant, which must have been undercooked because it was hard and chewy like beef jerky. The same person asked about the meal and I shared my disappointment, not thinking much of it.  After all I ordered it.Turned out he was the manager, and deducted the price of the late appetizer and the slimy egg plant from our bill.  So we paid for our broccoli beef and drinks, tipped hansomely and left, never to return again.",90503

It was hard to locate it if you didn't know what you were doing and the parking on a Sunday was difficult if you were only looking for a place to eat and not to shop. On the plus side, our server was very attentive and they made some changes in the Hunan Fish I ordered to accommodate my preferences.

Anyways, I would never suggest PF Changs, but once in a while I am forced to go here for an important function or work luncheon. I always go in with low expectations, but PF Chang's never fails to lower these expectations even further. The hot and sour soup was disturbingly pitch black. There were barely any chunks of tofu or bamboo shoots and it was really salty. Essentially, it was a bowl of watered down soy sauce...so Instead of drinking the soup, I used it like soy sauce to season my brown rice:/ Panda Express by far has better hot and sour soup. The wok-charred beef was overly sweet. Not good, but edible. Brown rice was really dry. Then there was dessert...banana eggrolls with ice cream. I guess 'eggrolls' was their attempt to make it asian. The coconut pineapple ice cream was really good. Stay away from the lemon tres leches dessert, that was disgusting. An extra star for decent service and clean environment. Food gets 0 stars.",90503

We put that we needed a booster seat and that it was my cousin's anniversary (the have a list of options). Upon arrival, they had the booster seat, the anniversary was never mentioned. I was under the impression that since it was on their website, maybe they brought a special dessert over or something, but nothing. Oh well, it wasn't a big deal.Our waiter was awesome. He was friendly and even hinted that the soda machine ""might be broken"" in case we didn't want our little one drinking soda. It was actually pretty clever the way he did it and she was young enough to believe it. I ordered hot tea which was brought over in a cute metal tea pot. I liked the presentation and it kept it hot.We decided to order family style and we ended up ordering 5 dishes and rice. I didn't have the pepper steak dish because my cousins said it would be too spicy for me, although it wasn't spicy enough for them! We also had Chang's spicy chicken (excellent, but not that spicy), sweet and sour chicken (good, not overwhelmingly sweet like at other restaurants) and the shrimp with candied walnuts (loved this one!). I had a shrimp dish there once before and I could not remember if it was the shrimp with candied walnuts or the crunchy honey shrimp. I'm trying the crunchy honey next time, or maybe I'll have both! The veggie fried rice was really good too.About the reviews with bad service, one time I was there and we had a waiter that was a little dingy, but wasn't really bad. The prices are a little high, but this isn't your regular Chinese restaurant... this is upscale, Americanized Chinese food and it's pretty damn good.

Basically, overpriced bland Americanized Chinese food. But if you enjoy McDonalds or Dennys, you won't know the difference.    We were starving and at the mall shopping so we popped in. Our waiter was really overly familiar, referring to me as ""Darlin, Love, & Sweetie"". It was really too much and he ignored my responses to his over familiarity which was ""Irritation"". I let it slide because he had a southern accent & I figured it was just apart of his personality. But as new older & younger customers were seated, I noticed he didn't call any of them ""Honey or Darl'in"". Which pissed me off.     Personally I think anything besides Ms. or Ma'am in that situation is disrespectful. So that's how I left the restaurant feeling, disrespected. On top of that. He was really bossy. I asked for hot sauce & he barked, ""Taste it first, its already spicy.""  I don't think his personality was compatible with ""people."" On top of all that, we had to track him down just to get the check. Food was bland but edible... and again Way overpriced. I'll pass from now on.",90503

I was really pleasantly surprised at the number of dishes that were NOT salad on the GF menu.  These were actual american-chinese (whatever that means) dishes.  I was happy to see that this could potentially be an alternative with my Gluten dietary restrictions. Plus, They have gluten free soy sauce!However, the dishes were all too salty.  So salty, I really couldn't finish my meal because my tongue was numb from salt.  Don't know if this amount of saltiness was exclusive to the GF dishes or if its for all dishes at PF Chengs but boy, were they salty.  I know that some GF soy sauces are saltier than normal soy sauce so maybe that might have been the problem?  nonetheless, i was really disappointed because I really wanted it to work out.  When i get really desperate again for some ""Chinese"" food, maybe i may give PF's GF menu another try.

Everything was going ok at the beginning. We love PF Changs, before kids we used to go to this chain Restuarant a lot as it was so close to us(not this specific location, we used to go to the La Jolla branch in San Diego).  We love the wide range of vegeterian/pescatarian options on the menu & just overall love the flavors. We were so nostalgic tonight, & ordered most everything we use to order back in the days. We got the veggie lettuce wrap, ma pu tofu, fried green beans, edemame, spicy fried eggplant dish. Everything was tasty & we all loved & enjoyed the food.Our waiter was very polite, excellent with kids & very attentive but I have to add that he was this way only at the very beginning. Towards the end, he was nowhere to be found. After we were done with dinner, the kids were getting antsy & started running around. I was trying to calm them down & I told my husband that he should just stay & pay for the bill so I can take the kids to the car. As I was having this conversation with my husband, I heard our next door table, saying something inappropriate about the kids. My husband immediately apologized to them & said to them: "" I hope the kids are not bothering you.""  Then the guy said: ""Whatever... Your kids are pretty rude"" & he started video taping them & taking photos of my kids. He even said: "" say hi to the Internet children..."".  As I was watching this, naturally I got upset & I told him:"" I don't want you to video my children"". But he was continuing to do what he was doing & he had his flash on right into my eyes.  So I just turned his phone the other direction.  He then said :""this is battery"". & used the F word. In the meantime,my husband told me to just leave with the kids so he can pay for the bill. As I was leaving the Restuarant I saw the manager speaking to that table & my husband. They basically were the kind of people that wanted free food & were looking for an excuse to get their food comped.  My husband said the guy kept using the F word throughout the conversation they had. So inappropriate!!!My husband said, the manager was on their side & very inattentive towards us. He was completely taking their side & just immediately comped their food. First off, we had been wanting to leave because the kids bedtime was approaching, the waiter was nowhere to be found. We had even asked him to bring the trio sauce & it took him more than 20 minutes to bring it. Also he forgot to bring us extra plates & utensils. It was really not our fault that he disappeared. The interaction we had today was very unprofessional, low class & a complete turn off. We would never go back to this Restuarant & I don't recommend this PF Changs location to anyone.  Terrible service & NO respect or any kind of understanding for small kids.

I look forward to it every time I go there.  Not Chinese at all, but really good.Same with all of their good dishes.  I order green beans and, instead of their regular sauce, ask for ""brown sauce.""   They have no clue what I mean by that.  How can a Chinese restaurant not know what brown sauce is?  Because PF Chang's isn't Chinese.But it tastes good.  And if you order things like the Kung Pao Chicken or their spicy green beans in brown sauce (after explaining what that is), you will leave satisfied and want to go back.And isn't that the hallmark of a good restaurant?",90503

Very blah.  Wha???  Strike 2.  You think our server woulda thrown me a bone and let me know this was sinply a bowl of steamed, unseasoned veggies, but now I know to ask about ANY dish that doesn't have a descriptor under it.  My friends were nice enough to donate some tasty grilled chicken to my sad entree and the sauces/spices helped amp it up.  Our server did separate out 15 checks for our group, so that was awesome... until it took 20 minutes to get our checks back saying the old ""the credit card machine is down""... he knew we were running late to a movie.  That's when you call for backup-- it wasn't busy in there...  Confusing experience overall.  I may try this place again if it's a huge group like we had, but not likely.",90503

408,"3525 Carson St Ste 166 Torrance, CA 90503",A And M O.,"Redondo Beach, CA",9/12/2017,1,"PF Chang is known for their slow service but normally once the food arrives, everyone forgets about how slow the service was. This specific location was not just late but forgot to bring our salad that we ordered. They got the entrée 30 minutes after we ordered the food and the salad never arrived, that we specifically requested to be bought before our entrée. Then they charged us $7.00 per glass for Santa Julia Cab Sauv, which is $9.00 per bottle if bought at the retail store. So I guess we are paying for the cheap wine, the glassware, the servers who are slow and lack customer service skills. So if you are hungry for food that will not arrive and be served by people who do not apologize for their poor serving skills, then by all means check out this PF Chang at the Del Amo mall.",90503

Let me give you the details on out meal here......Hot/sour soupThe hot/sour soup was delicious. I really enjoyed it; it had bold flavors and just enough heat. it's hot and sour soup, you can't really f---- up hot and sour soup.Spare rib appThe ribs were decent. I wish more came on the plate. The salad was pretty bland. It reminded me of crappy cafeteria cole slaw. Mongolian BeefThe tiny portion of beef sat on top of this huge mountain of green onion. They served me an appetizer portion of mongolian beef and hid it with monstrous amounts of inedible greens. I mean, I had to dig through the green onion to find my mongolian beef. Summing this up in one word: CHEAPSalmonUnderseasoned fish with bland asparagus. Lean Cuisine could have done a better job with this freezing it en masse and selling it at my grocery store. Wow, just horrible. Summing this up in one word: BLANDTres leches dessertDO NOT ORDER THIS. EVER. The amount of lemon they put into this overwhelms anything else you put into your mouth after that. This dessert resembled nothing like a tres leches cake. The Mrs. even told me that they gave me the wrong dessert.   HOLY SH*T SOUR!Other than that, Mr. Chang, the meal was good. Good job on my water, sprite, soup, white rice, and fortune cookie. They were delicious. Oh yeah, I forgot to mention, the waiter overcharged us by 5.00.

Hubby asks about ""House made ginger beer"", whether it is alcoholic or non; server unsure, but he orders it anyway. I ask for iced tea, sever asks if I would like the Passion fruit, or regular; I opt for the former. We continue to mull food options.Server comes back with waters and asks if we are ready to order. After some questions, we place our food order, I ask for the shrimp in lobster sauce, a salad for him, noodles to share.Server comes back, and puts down the ginger beer and sweetener I ask if he could bring the iced tea, he says "" Oh, you would like to order an iced tea? I reply that he had taken the order already and it was the Passion fruit...remember? OK.The food comes and 2 of our 3 dishes arrive, but actually 1 is not what we ordered. The runner/other server? apologizes for the error ( the kitchen prepared the dish the  input which was not what we ordered. He will input a correct order for replacement.A guy comes by to ask how things are ( street clothes, not a server - but he did not introduce himself, so we do not know who he is), by this time I had some of the shrimp dish and asked if the dish was supposed to have mushrooms ( I am a chef and read menus carefully, so I know it had mushrooms listed) he says yes they're there, but they are small enough that they would not be seen. OK, invisible mushrooms. As it turns out, the shared dish is one we have often and it is the double Pan-fried noodles - comes with visible mushrooms and someone does not eat mushrooms, so I always get his share, too. So forgive me for expecting mushrooms that are not like the Emperor's clothes. He says I could always ask for more mushrooms, in the future; I wonder if he means th ones you can see...?Our server comes with the 3rd dish and is correct, but still, no tea. Oh, yes, I'll bring some. That's nice - then I will have something to go with the sweetener you brought a long time ago - without a glass of tea!Now, with all the time it took to talk about invisible mushrooms, non-existent tea and incorrect dishes, it is time to get upstairs for our movie.I ask for the check and for our food to get boxed. The bill gets paid. No tip.I ask the hostess if I might speak with a manager. A bit later a nice lady comes over, introduces herself (long convo, won't bore you) she gives me her card and tells me that she would not dream of letting us pay for the meal.Good customer recovery.

Who drinks sake out of a wine glass?!!! We order our food and when the food comes out the servers have to ask us who ordered each dish. I understand we had a party of 12, but most restaurants I have been to that are $15 or more per dish, the servers will know who ordered each dish. They don't need to ask! Finally the food. I understand that P.F. Chiang's is Americanized and not necessarily authentic Chinese cuisine, but someone over there please tone down the sauce and the salt! No need to drown your food with sauces. We decided to all share and go family style so we can have some variety. However, all the foods had a similar taste. For the price you're better off going to Panda Express where the food is better.

Chang's.  My only two *VERY* minor complaints was the service and inability to make substitutions.The waitress was quick to come to the table to take our drink and food orders.  But after the dishes came, she was nowhere to be found.  We had to go inside to track her down to try to pay for the bill.  Note, this was at 2:30 - 3:00 p.m. and there was no one in the restaurant.  She was very friendly and helpful, but absent from sight.Secondly, I attempted to substitute my bowl of rice for some additional veggies.  The waitress politely told me that no substitutions were available, but she showed me the menu where I could order additional veggies for $8-12 a plate.  Uhhh... no thank you!  I ate the rice.",90503

Taking PF Changs for what it is, though, its decent food and isn't TERRIBLY priced if you go during happy hour. The service is also much easier to understand than going to a traditional Chinese place. Also, its really not that difficult to mix the sauces...you don't have to do it for me.That being said, PF Changs is a great date spot!",90503

Yes, this is not authentic Chinese food....hello, the PF in PF Changs stands for Paul Fleming not Peiwei Foo. Yes, certain dishes are a bit salty (think of that scene in Joy Luck Club where the ""American"" pours soy sauce heavily on the prized dish)Yes, the service can be off at times.But, the place is clean and neat.For the most part, the food is delicious. The Oolong marinated sea bass is off the chain. Their drinks are pretty tasty.

I enjoyed a late lunch at this PF Changs which happens to be the closest PF to my home but for some reason I have never went here..Just to make it quick the food is always good, its very consistent again whether you are here or at Beverly Hills, today I just happened to get the best service - possibly because I went during the time that business is most slow the happy hour.",90503

We were seated right away because the place was EMPTY! I was surprised that only 3 other tables were occupied. Considering it was practically empty, one would think the waiter/ess would be attentive. But that was far from the truth! The service completely sucked!!!It took 12 minutes for our waiter to come and introduce himself and take our drink orders. We ordered our food at the same time, considering we had so much time to look over the menu while we waited for him to attend to us. My friend ordered an iced tea and he brings him out a coke. He tells him that he will be right back with an iced tea but never showed up. We see him attending to other tables. Our appetizers came out right away. We asked him for more lettuce for our lettuce wraps and reminded him to bring my friend's iced tea, but he never shows up. After 7 minutes of waiting, we had to ask another waiter to assist us. Then our food comes out. 3 of us had ordered brown rice with our entrees, but they only brought 1 cup of white rice. We told our waiter and he said he'll be right out with the brown rice. But guess what.... he never showed up. And on top of it, the food sucked! We all felt sick right after we ate. The food was incredibly greasy and did not taste like it was cooked thoroughly. Furthermore, the floor beneath us was dirty, there was food on the seats, the food tasted bad, and the staff overall seemed out of it. I was so surprised and disappointed with what i saw and experienced, especially because i have never been disappointed by other PF Changs locations. (By the way, this was not the first time my friends had a bad experience at this particular location). I understand people have bad days sometimes, and our waiter may have been having a bad day. But for God's sake, when you come to work, leave your problems at the door.

What do you expect when a bunch of ignorant palates come here in an area where it is in the mall; what do you expect to happen? First off, I don't know how this place can pass off as Chinese I really don't I guess people who'd come here just want food to taste good and don't care what the concept is; thats what American fusion is all about. I came here once, and then decided not to come again. For one, everything is way overpriced and the portions are small. I look around in a packed dining room and see a bunch of people using forks and drinking a glass of merlot. Cmon, is that what you'd really expect from a true chinese place? Get real. The cooks may be Chinese instead of Mexican, but they're sellouts. Yes they have all the ""traditional"" items like beef and broccoli and kung pow chicken. For something so high priced I'd expect a lot better from the salty dishes. I might as well eat something tasteful with msg than something that has more sodium in it like salt.

Man, I'm telling you, that dish was sooooooo awesome... either I was really hungry or the cook really did a good job on that dish!!! If you ever decide to go to this place, that dish is Highly Recommended.   Also, I would recommend that you reserve a table before you go over there, cause it might get really crowded sometimes.",90503
459,"3525 Carson St Ste 166 Torrance, CA 90503",Carl A.,"Fullerton, CA",6/1/2011,2,"Since this a chain restaurant ,and most folks understand that chains have one thing in common, ""they all taste the same."" This is a good trait for the restaurant. For rating, this takes us down to the service personnel. For these people we focus on the speed of the orders getting to your plate and and attentiveness.The wait staff: The staff seemed to be spread thin. I am sure that we were not left purposly waiting to order. I am also sure that they were attempting to multi-task when you asked for flatware and napkins and they forgot that you existed. I am absolutely sure that we were as important to them as the table of 10 that came in after our table of four was seated.Attentiveness: Almost all of the food arrived together. The waiter forgot about one in our party and put a rush on that particular dish. The wait wasn't terribly long and on the plus side, we were able to chit-chat just that much longer. The final dish arrived and the staff disappeared. After a while I thought that the dinner was free because no one showed up with the check...and when it finally arrived, no one wanted to pick it up.The food was tasty and predictable. The decor was typical P.F. Chang, pleasant and comfortable. I held off reviewing this Chang until the second time I visited as my first visit might have been a fluke...no fluke. Seems like normal operations for PF Chang at the Carson Street location.If your guests are PF Chang fans, go.If you are a PF Chang fan...you already know what to expect.If you are looking for that special upscale Chinese dinner with attention focused on you and your companion, check out Yelp a little further.Conclusion: Personally, I think twice for dinner is enough and I will be moving on.

Chang's has become more expensive, portions are getting smaller, and the food quality has gone south.  For Americanized Chinese in the South Bay, I prefer W's.Still, I like the Mongolian Beef.  The crab/cream cheese wontons are good--as is the wonton soup.  The chicken with broccoli is pretty good.  There are a lot of dishes you will want to skip (such as the bland Moo Goo Gai Pan).  I don't really care for any of the desserts.Even though their prices have gone up, you can still get out of here with limited damage when you eat family style.  The service is kind of hit-and-miss-here.  But they are usually quick.",90503

Chang's in Santa Monica and Irvine and had better experiences at those locations.  Still, the food was not spectacular.  P.F.

I get it, Hot Fish, but it ruins the experience of enjoying a meal when your mouth is on fire. And yes, I asked the server about the level of heat and she said it is not 'that hot.' That little B lied. Also, makes me think, is this drenched in a super spicy sauce to cover a  fishy taste because the fish may be old? I get paranoid when it comes to restaurants serving fish with an overpowering sauce.Next dish- garlic spinach. Hm. I tasted dirt spinach. After one bite, I tasted the grittiness in my mouth.

Was really excited since we were not only spending time as a family but we were also celebrating as a family. First the service...They attempted to put us at a table with 2 tables pushed together. THAT was not the problem. The problem was the for the 2 ppl that had to sit right in the middle. Not only was there an easy inch or more difference in height between the 2 tables making it impossible for a plate to sit comfortably on the table. It would have been teetered on one side or the other. When we asked to either have that fixed or moved the hostess acted like we were wasting her time. She moved us but only placed 2 other tables together and never came back and got us. WE had to move all of our own plates, silverware & menus. Ok, not really a big deal, we can handle that. The food I'm bummed to say has changed. It's not the same quality. I would say it was mediocre. The orange peel beef was surprisingly bland and cold when it came to our table. It looked like it had been sitting there for a while. But we could never tell anyone because no one ever came to our table. Our reservation was for a Monday night so it wasn't that busy. Waitress never asked us if we wanted soup or salad. Never checked on us to see if we wanted more dishes or how our meal was. And we never ended the meal with fortune cookies. (I know not THAT big of a deal) Its just that when I made the reservation and when we got there I made sure to let them know that we were there to celebrate a very big family event I would have a expected a little more attention to detail. I'm just very disappointed and will not be back again. fyi....EVEN with all of this we STILL tipped 20%. Just wont be returning.",90503

Changs to serve me ""authentic"" Chinese food.  What I do expect is food that my taste buds enjoy.  Unfortunately for me, this P.F. Changs (and the other two I have tried in my lifetime) did not leave me with the desired result.We ended up here one night for a birthday party.  We tried to go to B.J.'s, which is also at Del Amo, but the wait for such a large group was ridiculous.  There was a very short wait P.F. Changs, as they seated us outside.  My friends and I ordered a few appetizers and tried a few dishes:Lettuce wraps: super salty, rendering the chicken without any other flavorCrab wontons: weird, but I rarely resist crabGarlic noodles: it was like ramen noodles from the bag ... but the kind without any garlic ... or flavor.  Green greens: slightly on the salty side, but okayOne friend got the chow fun (the flat white noodles).  Apparently, if you eat this first and THEN try the garlic noodles, the garlic noodles can be described as ""an explosion of flavor.""  True story.  No amount of soy sauce, hot sauce, or any other type of sauce could save this dish.The brown rice was actually pretty good.  The staff was nice and decently attentive.  The beers were cheap and worked well to dull my taste buds over the course of dinner.  Another friend got the orange chicken or beef.  He was decently satisfied with his dinner.However, I would not recommend the tiramisu AT ALL.  I had one of those little ones that come in an oversized shot glass.  Um, an essential ingredient in tiramisu is rum.  If you do not have or want to use rum, you use rum extract.  If you don't use either, it's not tiramisu.  I was incredibly disappointed.I mulled over whether I should give this place only one star, but given the fact that they have friendly, nice people who work there and its beers are reasonably priced, I begrudgingly gave it two stars.",90503

I've always heard of PF Chang's so I had high expectations, which our waitress immediately dismissed.  She took FOREVER to ask for our drinks, get our drinks and come back to take our order.  We probably didn't actually start eating until around 7:15, 45 minutes after we sat down!  Don't get me wrong, she was really nice, friendly, and tried to (really awkwardly) make small talk... but good service is more important.  For appetizers we ordered lettuce wraps with chicken.  It wasn't bad, but I've definitely had better.  To be completely honest, the one at CPK is better (seriously).  Our entrees were Chinese chicken salad and Moo goo gai pan under traditions.  We had NO idea what ""Moo goo gai pan"" was, so we asked our waitress and she told me its the best dish on the menu. FALSE: if thats the best dish on the menu, I would be worried.  It was really bland stir fry of fish, water chestnuts, celery, and small shrimp.  It came with two bowls of brown rice, which was nice.  The Chinese chicken wasn't good either.  When I ordered, the waitress told me it would take a while because ""we cook the chicken.  It's not pre-made or anything!""

I was sitting there talking to my fiance and noticed it was 7:50pm so I decided to walk back up and ask if there was a table available for my 7:15 reservation I made. The young lady looked in the computer and said oh yeah we have a table for you. Which confused me because not one was my named called to let me know there was a table available. Now I will admit I had a really nice waiter. After sitting down and ordering our food the waiter came back about 5 minutes later and said we do not have any more strawberry lemonade and we do not have any more prawns. So our waiter had to bring us back a menu so we could see what else we would like to order in the place of the items they did not have. My FAVORITE dish is the Salt and pepper prawns which was not available. I was Ajay irritated by the wait and now i couldn't even get my favorite dish.

My food is suppose to be spicy when it's on point.  Then today, I come in ready for my food and the order was wrong.The food is not spicy the way it's supposed to be and the service is not great. When you see nearly empty glasses, that's a hint, they need refills. Then when we do ask for refills it takes forever. I could be choking, and no drink. Then it's time to pay. The server brings my card back with the receipt to sign, but I can't sign it because there is no pen to sign with.  But I'm not going to leave the receipt blank so the server can add a bigger tip than is deserved. So luckily my wife had a pen. I guess next time I should expect great service and great food. Since the pattern at PF Changs is one great, one bad, then great, then bad, etc.  Hopefully they can get to a point of being consistent with great tasting food and service.",90503

It would mean great beer and big food, but we're both exercising restraint in the interest of our health. House of Vege? She wasn't so impressed last time we went. Tofu House? Boring place, no ambience, not a lot of fun. Ryo Zan Paku? Good, but we're saving money right now and a good meal with sake would be spendy. I suggested PF Chang's. ""We could get lettuce wraps and a drink."" Convenient, nice atmosphere, good food selection. It sounded like a good plan.Considering that we go to a lot of authentic Chinese restaurants, it should be noted that PF Chang's, while not authentic Chinese, is still good food. New to me was the draft ginger beer which was very good,  though not as good as Hitachino. My wife had hot sake in a very hot bottle. We sat at the bar, which we always find cozier than two people at a larger table. It also means immediate service, generally. Our bartender/host was prompt and courteous. We ordered the chicken lettuce wraps- tofu lettuce wraps didn't sound so interesting, but our bar neighbor got it and it looked like it might be worth trying next time. Four very crispy lettuce shells with a large plate of chicken does not work very well- I'm not sure what the logic is in the balance of wraps to meat, but we had to ask for more lettuce. The sauce can be made spicy hot to taste, we asked for mega-spicy. The second dish was salt and pepper calamari which was served fried with a sweet dipping sauce which was much too powerful- you could not taste the meat if you had any of this on it, and the salt and pepper in a small cup. Way too much salt, not enough pepper. Spring rolls were very good. Fried, but pretty fresh tasting and packed generously with vegetables. Food was satisfying, service was friendly. A nice meal. That's how to put it best. Nice. Not great, not memorable, not unique, but nice. And for most people, that's a good thing.",90503

529,"3525 Carson St Ste 166 Torrance, CA 90503",Kenneth D.,"Redondo Beach, CA",11/30/2010,3,"Been to the Manhattan beach location a long time ago but I'm reviewing one of a few visits to this location. For lunch in my area or randomly it seems I end up at the mall. The food here isn't bad, it's not great either. Each place has it's own thing going for it, Ra has the bar...BJs has the hours and the beers and pizookie. P.F. Changs is probably the best place out of the lot for decor. I'd say fancier than Olive Garden, I'd take a date there, which I did. We had a large party and the wait was only 20 minutes sans reservation on a Saturday which was good. While we wait we went to the bar and the drinks were reasonable and decently alcoholic. For appetizers my date and I got the shrimp dumplings and the lettuce wrap and then for a meal we shared honey shrimp and mongolian beef. The mongolian beef was ok, the same quality as most chinese places and the honey shrimp was good, still their is honey shrimp at other places that is just amazingly good. Although I have favorably rated other mall places I have to say this...The 18% included gratuity and price of the meals/drinks does not justify the taste, I mean it's good but it's not amazing either. There isn't really a pull, Ra has the bar, BJs the beer. It's not a party place nor is it cheap and easy. There is a lot better Chinese food for cheaper, whether you are going Americanized Chinese, authentic, fast food, or fusion/inspired style. I will say at lunchtime P.F. changs prices match most other Chinese food in it's caliber, so if you want lunch I'd suggest it, however I wouldn't make a trip out just for P.F. Changs, for the same price I'd stir you to google and yelp chinese food, you'll find what you're looking for, better in taste and price.However if the friends or date wanna come here, it isn't bad so don't leave in protest.Still compared to the other ""Del Amo"" places P.F. Chang has no real pull or ""WOW"" dish or factor that would make me go there specificallyWhat comes close - those lettuce wraps, but that's about it.",90503

To be honest, I've been hearing how P.F. Chang's Chinese food isn't authentic. So I was a bit cautious going in. But I must say, I'm pleasantly surprised. Okay, so yes, it wasn't as authentic a Chinese meal as if I was having dinner in the heart of Shanghai. But the food was good. Bigger portions wouldn't hurt, or bump up quality a bit. What made our experience though (going back to my earlier point), is Daniel. He was efficient, informative (very detail oriented, I like), genuinely excited to be there to ""show us around"", witty, quick, thorough, no mistakes, unpretentious, I could go on and on. I might even go as far as to say that this guy is THE BEST server I've ever had. He needs some sort of promotion, or raise, or at least his photo on the wall for employee of the month. The manager was also very friendly and personally came to our table to thank us for coming. Bottomline, I don't live in the area, but will definitely come back if I find myself around.",90503

Heres my reasons:A perfect place to celebrate occassions such as birthdays, anniversarry's, etc.... The restaurant is surrounded by helpful waiters and waitresses. The restaurant had a delightful ambiance. Although the noise level can get a lil noisy but expect that specially going to a very popular place. They also box your left overs  infront of you. Food:DEEE-LLI--CIOUS!The food you order you can definately share because they serve in a big platter with the abundance of your order. 1. I totally recommend their entree lettuce wrap. I had lettue wrap before from a different restaurant and i thought it was the best  but i was wrong. Pf chang's is one of a kind. The meat is well season,mouth watering and a total magnet for I say, ""another order please!"" I dont know what they use for a secret ingredient because it is absolutely to die for. *its ok to ask for more lettuce. The meat is served plenty but only four pieces of the lettuce. 2. Pf chang's all combination fried rice is also a MUST. If Iam not mistaken the combination includes chicken,beef, shrimp,and mix vegetables. It is served in a big bowl to be shared. 3. Orange mandarin chicken: This isnt the ordinary orange chicken you get from panda express or hongkong express. Iam not a fan of orange chicken but what they had made me become an orange chicken fan! Again it is to be shared. 4. Honey cashew walnut shrimp and chicken: It was tasteful but too much cashew nuts and walnuts. It was almost perfect but i just hate chewing  nuts. I should have told the waitress to ease down on the nuts! (but i thought it would sound funny!) However, the chicken and shrimp was so juicy and soft. Again it is to be shared. 5. The great wall of China: Dessert of course! Chocolate covered cake, Caramel frosting, big chunks of dark chocolate on top, and glazed with rasberry cream that melts In your mouth. Dangerously Good!

When the friendly hostess walked us to our table, the room was filled with dining patrons, with us barely making through our walk past tables that were just giving us just enough room in between tables to make it to our table,  which was right in the center of the room. Nicely set up table setting and immediately our staff server was by our table to attend to our food requests, except we took our time to browse through the menu; she returned to take our food orders after a few minutes. Our food arrived well-presented and in just the right food warmth. Food taste was average, with just the right amount of tastefulness as you would expect in a Chinese cuisine that's catered to Americanized taste. The lighting within the restaurant was somewhat a romantic dinner ambiance although it was crowded with mainly family groups to college, business-types out on a dinner night get-together, and mall visiting crowd as it was situated within a mall and shopping venues. The one good meal we ordered that we liked was the 'Chicken Lettuce Wraps' which is presented on the menu as an appetizer but it fits like an ala carte meal, of crunchy lettuce and tangy meat fillings, as tasty as it is in its generously served portion. It also have a vegetarian version on the menu made with tofu. The menu also comprise gluten-free meals, seafood, salad, duck, lamb, chicken, beef, pork, soups, desserts, noodles, rice, drinks, wine, as well as kid's menu. The salmon and duck meals are ones I like. Nosh in this restaurant stands on the affordable to mid-scale price. With its good, quick, attentive service, it would be a nice place to return to when in need of a decent bite in between shopping spree only for once in a time but preferably instead would go spend more for real authentic Chinese cuisine in Chinatown.

The fried green beans was by far the best thing I put in my mouth here, the calamari was okay but the dipping sauces were gross, my pad thai was sweet and disgusting I didn't touch it after the 2nd bite (1 bite for shrimp, 1 bite for chicken).

Served with cilantro over shredded lettuce.""    It did have lamb, a few bits of cilantro, and was served over lettuce.  The weird part, was that it was drenched in some sort of creamy sauce that seemed like a mix between thousand-island dressing and some vague peanutty thai sauce.   Overall, it was not particularly good.So in short, I think that I've had much better tasting food at most other restaurants.  I would maybe give it a 2.5, but would say it's strictly ""below average"".  For the same price range, the Lazy Dog Cafe across the way trumps it in just about every category.",90503

All of our sauces have sugar. Our soy sauce has sugar with bone marrow.""    First of all, that's wrong; vegetarians don't eat animal products.  The line between vegan and vegetarian is about dairy (and sometimes clothing), NOT BONE MARROW.  WTF!  How can they say this on their own menu?  I read the very small print at the bottom of the menu, and apparently PF Chang's has their own interpretation of what a vegetarian is: P.F. Chang's Vegetarian items do not contain any meat ingredients, but may contain dairy and eggs.  Apparently you now need an attorney when you go to PF Chang's because they have swapped the word meat with animal.  I guess meat has no bone marrow!  Anyway, there are 8 of us and my 95 year old Auntie is starting to get antsy.  I asked to see the Chef.  This review is taking a very long way to say that after meeting with us, the Exec Chef prepared a lovely delicious lunch for our three vegetarians without the sugar/bone marrow ingredients.  He saved the day.  Everyone was happy, the food was good, and we had a great time, thanks to our Chef.

I don't eat at PF Changs - haven't in about a decade. The food isn't bad - it's just not my preference though to be fair, I haven't even looked at their menu since the last time I ate at one. The menu may have changed and dishes may be offered that fit more to my taste but I still didn't even look at the food menu the other day. Maybe one day ... Anyway, a friend and I ended up at the bar for Happy Hour after walking thru the Galleria and finding nothing else to do. Figured, why not go and be Happy and avoid the smoky smell and wind outside while we waited for our appetite to grow for dinner. I can't remember our bartender's name but she was awesome. She was friendly and she made a very nice, well balanced cocktail. Two actually. I had both the Asian Pear Mojito and an Organic Agave Margarita. She was mindful of not adding too much or too little of one ingredient which can ruin simple drinks like I ordered and I enjoyed them both. Especially for the Happy Hour prices of $6 each. I don't expect prices like that unless I'm in Dive Bar - which PF Changs, is definitely not. The parking at the Galleria is in the structure, meaning it's a pay lot - however, PF Changs does validate. I don't know for how long the validation is valid for but it was free for us - which is always a good thing. Knowing that PF Changs has a Happy Hour - maybe one day I'll drop in on one of their locations and try the food again. If not for the food, at the least - for their Happy Hour. 3-6 Mon-Fri",91403

The waitress asked if we wanted  the soups and appetizers served the same time as our entrees. Never heard that asked before.  Then every time our water glasses needed some refilling they kept bringing new filled water glasses. At no point did they clear the ever growing glasses at the table.  The food was subpar (I am being kind). It somewhat resembled Asian cuisine. Wish the recipes were as good as the food was described on the menu. I can't find a reason to dine there again.",91403

When I do, it's usually a  really repeat visit with multiple negative experiences, or the experience was really egregious. This review is being posted after multiple recent negative experiences here, as well as a horrible overall experience today. For starters, we were seated, and it took almost 20 minutes for a waiter to check in with us. Unfortunately, that was bad news for me because their main menu referenced a gluten free menu, and that's what I wanted. The waiter's first stop at our table only gave me the chance to ask for a different menu. He returned, and I ordered a low mein with no chicken or vegetables for one kid. I ordered a kid's chicken nuggets for the other kid. I asked the waiter if they had ketchup because my kid won't eat the chicken without it. The waiter assured me that they had ketchup and would bring it out with the meal. I also ordered a sushi item as an appetizer, my husband ordered a soup for an appetizer, and my husband and I ordered our  entrees. After we ordered, it took about 10 minutes for my husband's soup to get dropped off at our table. No waiters checked in, but I thought my sushi order would arrive any minute. Unfortunately, no sushi came, but another 10 minutes later, our food came. There was chicken with the lo mein despite the order asking for NO CHICKEN, no ketchup with the chicken nuggets, and no sushi still. We asked the bus boy who brought the food out to bring us some ketchup. Five minutes later, my son won't eat his food without the ketchup, my daughter is picking chicken out of her noodles, and oh, still no sushi. No waiter to check in either. After another five minutes (now 10 minutes post food drop off), we go flag another waiter down and explain what Is going on. He assured us he will get a new low mein order in, will get the ketchup, and will sort out my sushi order. I asked that they just cancel the sushi at this point. He sends a manager out, and she profusely apologizes for all of the missteps throughout the experience and reiterated that she will get a new low mein order, and says they will comp some of our bill. Ketchup finally gets dropped 15 minutes after food came. His chicken nuggets were cold  by this point, but he  was fine to eat it. They drop off my sushi that I had cancelled  ten minutes prior and explain that would be on the house. We all finish our food and are still waiting for the replacement low mein. They forgot that AGAIN! We ended up asking them to box it up so that I could just get out of there ASAP before I would lose it.",91403

I've visited with both family and friends. During the middle of the day during the week for lunch is a great time to visit with family. It's not as crowded and you can hear each other speak without yelling across the table. The food is hot and fresh and the lettuce wraps are tasty. Arriving to this location on a Friday or Saturday night is a different story. It's a lot livelier and the noise is pretty elevated. I like to get the night started here because of its prime location.

34,"15301 Ventura Blvd Ste P-22 Sherman Oaks, CA 91403",Marisa L.,"Tarzana, CA",7/4/2020,4,"UPDATE #3We have done online ordering with curbside pick up from this location twice in the last few weeks and it's been a very smooth experience. Ordering is easy (you can choose ASAP or a specific time to pick up) you call when you arrive and they bring it to your car wearing a mask. The orders have been on point, exactly as ordered, well packaged and delicious. I love the vegetarian lettuce wraps and fried rice. My daughter loves the kids lo mein. Their in house service was consistently challenging, but they've got the take out game down to a science. I'm impressed. UPDATE #2: You can see PF Chang's response below asking that I contact them so they can follow up. I did and they didn't. My sister and I often meet at this location with our tween/teen kids. The food is always above average (for a chain) with something for all of us. I am gluten free and ovo-vegan. When they are not busy...meaning pretty deserted, the service is exceptional. If they are even slightly busy, much less a weekend evening, all bets are off, every diner for themselves. Over years of patronage here, this is consistent. For example, we had a reservation for the 5 of us 6pm this past Sunday, the evening before Presidents' Day. It was busy, but there were free tables. When we arrived the hostess was available but as I stood next to her, she did not acknowledge me though she was just staring into space. When I said, ""We have a reservation."" She said she didn't see it, but would find us a table. I offered to show her the confirmation email, but she declined. The reservation was confirmed as filled later, so they clearly found it. Our waitress was warm and efficient. Still, our food took nearly an hour to arrive. My dish was loaded with onions, which I asked to omit, so I spent the meal picking them out rather than make my family wait another hour for a replacement, which was offered long after the food was delivered by someone else. My nieces Wok Filet was loaded with big chunks of tomato, which was not listed as an ingredient on the menu. She does not like tomatoes and was picking them out. My sangria (ordered 5 minutes after the food) was delivered by yet another staff as we were finishing the meal. I think we all enjoy sipping our drink as we wait for our food and through the meal, not slamming it so the kids don't have to wait for us to finish.None of this was the waitress' fault, but terrible management and chronic understaffing. Our schedules don't always allow us to go to PF Chang's at slow times. It's unfortunate how they fall apart otherwise. *UPDATE*I shared our experience as requested here by guest services. No response. This goes along with my consistent experience of this location. Terrible management, more bad experiences than good, no follow up when we share our experiences. Sends the message that they couldn't care less about .",91403

The extensive menu has something for just about everyone, but the flavors have been ""dumbed down"" so as not to intimidate their target demographic. This is food for people who want to think they're eating exotic stuff but it kind of falls short. Nothing really stands out, although the ingredients are good quality and the portions are generous. Prices are about what you'd expect, a bit on the higher side. Everything tastes kind of generic, and that's too bad. The average ""hole-in-the-wall"" Asian food joint does way better without breaking a sweat.The room has a very warm and laid-back vibe and it's loud but not annoyingly so. The service was excellent; Shane was attentive, professional, and super-nice, hence the extra half star. Seating is comfortable and not too crowded, also a plus.To sum up: kind of pricey and not too authentic, but after all, this establishment is located in a shopping mall, so not surprising, either.",91403

The movie was at Arclight so the natural choice (with very limited options) was PF Chang's since we could walk over after the movie and not a lot of alternatives open on Christmas Eve. They honored our reservation despite the fact that they were very crowded at 7 PM. Bonus points for that. But it went down hill after that. Our server came to our table right after we sat down, handed us the menu and in under a minute asked if we were ready to order. Nope, we needed a little more time than that. He was back about 2 minutes later. Same question, same answer. Yes, we felt we were being rushed just a bit. Service remained below mediocre throughout the meal.We started with Chicken Lettuce Wrap ($11.50) and Veggie Spring Rolls ($5.25 for 2) as appetizers. Each was OK but not great. As entrees, we went with Chicken Pad Thai ($15.50) and Kung Palo Beef ($19). The Pad Thai was mediocre at best.

41,"15301 Ventura Blvd Ste P-22 Sherman Oaks, CA 91403",Raymundo M.,"Los Angeles, CA",2/15/2020,1,"Im not the kind of person that likes to talk negatively about a place, but I feel like I need to let others know of the bad service that we received here.Let me start out with the positives. The only great thing about this place, were the greeters when you walk in. They were really kind and courteous. I had a reservation at 8:15pm, and I got there at around 7:50pm. When I checked in, they noticed that I was there early, but I told them that it was fine, I can wait for a bit. They were nice enough to let me get a table earlier. That was around roughly 8. So kudos to them for making that happen.Now onto the bad. We sit down, a waiter comes by to help us. I didn't forget his name. I don't currently have my receipt, but I'll update this when I have it. The miss asked for asked for a gluten friendly menu, so he took down our drinks order and came right back with them, but no gluten free menu in hand. This is when it starts. I reminded the server that we didn't have the gluten free menu yet. He give me a pretty annoyed look at that, left and brought the menu. I wanted to get an appetizer, so I ordered some pork dumplings. Then a little after the main entrees were ordered as well. The worst part of it all, is that nothing arrived to us. Keep in mind that we sat down at 8pm. We didn't get our food until 8:50pm. How does it take an hour to receive the food??? The food didn't even taste fresh either! If it's going to take that long, then it would at least be nice and hot, not warm and close to getting cold.Worst part of all, our main server wasn't even the one that brought the food. Another server came and brought us our entree. Keep in mind that these are the entrees that came. I never got my dumplings that I wanted as an appetizer. Our main waiter came in and asked if we still wanted them, so I told him that not anymore since we were already eating. He said ok, I'll tack them off the check. Sure enough, a couple minutes after, a third waiter comes by to drop off the dumplings. I was boggled with the lack of communication amongst everybody there! It was a disappointing night out! To top it off, my girlfriend is allergic to gluten. She asked the waiter if the entree that she wanted didn't have gluten, and the sever said that it didn't. She ordered it, ate it, then sure enough, after a while she wasn't feeling so good. So her experience for a nice Valentine's Day dinner, was completely ruined. She had a rough time the rest of the night since her stomach was aching. I believe that restaurants need to take allergies serious, but this waiter seemed like he didn't take it too serious.The lack of service was such a bummer! I would've been a little more understanding if the waiter came by to check in on us every so often while we waited for the food, but unfortunately he never checked in on us at all. He just brought us our drinks, took our orders and disappeared. An ""I'm sorry for the delay, we're getting everything done for you"" kind of comment from him would've been more than helpful. What's most disappointing is the fact that others were being seated after us, and were getting their food, while we waited for our food! Like what kind of service is that. The service and food, is something that just might make me stray away from P.F. Chang's for a good while. That was not a pleasant Valentine's Day dinner.",91403

I ordered from pfchangs today Mongolian beef with extra beef and brown rice and I went to pick it up and waited for about 10 minutes until it was ready. I was home in less than 7 minutes and opened it up to eat and it was ice cold and the onions were wilted and they gave me white rice instead of brown rice. I can't understand how most Chinese restaurants to order from and pick up food that it's piping hot when you bring it home. There's no excuse to be eating cold food when you have to wait for it to be ready. What are you doing I threw away the white rice because I don't eat it and quite frankly the food was truly disgusting. I'm sorry to have to write this review but maybe it'll help you get your kitchen in order. I spoke with your manager tonight and she said I'm very sorry oh, our food doesn't travel that well. If your food doesn't travel well then don't offer it for takeout.",91403

We ordered Pad Thai and a few other dishes - none were good. the place is not bad but i just have to say that its overpriced and i recommend eating at a local asian cuisine which would be much better  than this place.

The appetizers were decent but the main dishes were terrible there Vegan bowl was a plate of steamed store bought veggies (even though we asked for stir-fried). We ordered a coffee when we  first got there yet we had to ask the waiter three times to get it. The overall taste of it all was mediocre beside a ginger sauce.

This typically isn't my ideal place to dine but I think I finally found some items on the menu that I actually enjoyed. We ordered the California rolls, none of which I tried cause I cannot stand the taste and smell of seaweed, the chicken lo mein (which was nicely proportioned with chicken) and the crispy honey chicken. All the main dishes were very tasty, nothing overly greasy like I had before. Nothing overly salty, just the right amount of seasoning. The chef/cooks on staff here did a great job. Staff was friendly and we had a very funny moment with our waiter. Adam was a really nice guy and was very helpful at all times. The place was clean and service was quick. The only slight knock on the meal was that the fried banana roll wasn't very hot, maybe it sat too long after coming off the fryer but I mean it still looked good. I didn't try it but I trust my fellow Eliter cause it was for her. I was actually craving mango mochi so I didn't look at the dessert menu. Overall a great experience.",91403

You can come in and order you favorite dish every time, and it will be cooked the exact same way. And that's pretty much what we do. A few months ago the Dan Dan noodle disappeared from the menu and I about had a heart attack. I love those damn Dan Dan noodles. I've tried to re-create them at home, have tried every copy cat recipe there is, and I cannot make them even close to how delicious they are in real life. Thankfully, even though they are not on the menu, you can still order them. This is good or I would riot. We also order the spicy green beans, Mongolian beef, and the crispy honey shrimp. Every. Damn. Time. Occasionally we order some different appetizers just to mix it up, but the order stays the same. The Mongolian beef is just crispy and flavorful, it's so good. The crispy honey shrimp is far superior to the crispy honey chicken. And the spicy green beans are the perfect side dish. Add the Dan Dan noodles (made mild) to the mix and I couldn't be happier. This location does get pretty busy, so make a reservation if you can. We also love that they have a gluten-free menu which makes dining out with my Mom so much easier. Kudos, PF Changs.",91403

Perfectly cooked, and quite a good sized portion!!!  We usually share an entree since we usually can't finish our entrees... but not this time!!! We each devoured our entire entree, and were completely satisfied.  Even at the regular price without any promotions ($27.95 each), it is still a very good deal for the quality & portion size of Chilean Sea Bass.  Tip:  If you plan to go there often, you should join their PF Chang's Reward Club.  They give you 10 points per dollar spent, and then you get a free entree when you reach 2,000 points!",91403

The host just handed  me the order once I gave her my name, had me sign the credit card receipt & left without a ""Thank you"" or some type of acknowledgement for giving them my money / business. Guest satisfaction is crucial in this type of market as the competition keeps rising.  Take good care of your customers as they may not return for a great while. The Mongolian Beef was chewy & tough. It's usually flavorful & tender. The BBQ Ribs were dried up and burnt (I order the one's with the BBQ Sauce) my 1st bite was crispy.  The white rice was good.

I think our poor waiter was covering most of the indoor/outdoor himself while others seemingly do nothing. The food was very disappointing as well; a good 80-90% noodles, remainder was proteins. Noone finished their food, and no, we didnt take it home either. It amazes my how places like this stay in business.

After sitting there sometime,  we were able to catch the attention of the flirting bussers, who had been studiously avoiding our eye and promised to fetch our waiter.She appeared shortly thereafter, sweet, pleasant and smiling, we ordered a large bottle of Pellegrino, dry rubbed spare ribs, steamed shrimp dumplings to start, and to follow Chilean SeaBass, Szechuan asparagus, Brown and white rice... and were contemplating the banana egg rolls to finish.The ribs and dumplings arrived very quickly, we tucked in... ribs were tepid, dumplings despite sitting in a sauce were quite dry (I much prefer dumplings arriving in their own little canister to keep them moist, with the sauce on the side), taste of both so-so.The mains arrived, bountiful amounts. The Bass arrived plopped atop a sodden mess of spinach swimming in very salty sauce, was hard and so difficult to cut that I thought it was a chicken breast. The pencil thin Szechuan asparagus included all of the fibrous ends that should have been discarded. The rices were good. After a few bites of each, edge off our hunger, we looked at each other and decided we were forgoing any dessert.Listening to a waiter espouse the glories of the bass to the couple in the adjacent booth, we wanted to shout. No! Don't do it! Not the bass!Paying quickly, we departed, in the car, munching on dried mango to brighten our mouths, we vowed to speak up immediately upon being served some insipid food (unless at home of course)A disappointing and expensive meal.

If you ask, PF Chang's will validate for 1 hour; after a certain time (4 pm?) it's only $1/hr that you exceed the validation, which isn't bad at all.Food is generally fine - nothing fantastic, but gets the job done. Fairly Americanized Chinese food served ""family-style"", with various rices and noodles to eat with your meat choices. The chicken lettuce wraps were probably the highlight for me; the fried shrimp and chow mein were tasty, but didn't leave me feeling too great afterwards. My Ketel martini with olives, however, was fantastic ;).So why the 1 star for a decent if not perfect meal? Our company tried to have our office holiday party here last week, and the management was a joke. We had reserved the private room so we would be able to play games Being that it was one of the 5 days in Los Angeles where it rains every year, there was apparently a problem with their reservations, because a large party of ~50+ people was supposed to be enjoying some food/drinks on the patio. Due to the rain, this party was moved inside, and the manager (Tessa) opted to set up their food in the private dining room as a result. Please keep in mind, we received NO warning/heads up that this was going to happen. My coworker who planned this party showed up a few minutes early and was informed that we were set up at a table in the middle of the restaurant. When she asked to see the manager she corresponded with, Tessa (blonde with an accent), Tessa straight-up LIED to her and said that our reservation hadn't been for the private room. After my coworker pointed out that, yes, in fact, it WAS (showing the emails corresponding with her to prove it), she gave her a blank stare and said (verbatim) ""I don't know what to tell you."" Yes, weather happens, plans change, whatever, but it was handled absolutely atrociously. No apology, no courtesy phone call prior to explain the situation and how she would make the best of it, nothing. On top of the lying. We did receive a discount on our pre-set menu after my coworker essentially demanded it based on our treatment, and we were able to move into the private room after a couple hours for the tail end of our evening, but in general was not impressed with the handling of it.Please note that the 1-star has NOTHING to do with our waiter or other staff we encountered following this debacle; they were all wonderfully attentive and polite. I'm sure this PF Chang's is in business only because they it is a famous chain and it's conveniently located by the movie theater - it's clear that managing it properly is not a concern for them.",91403

Considering that i now live near one, i decided to check it out with my sister for dinner one day. We walked in and were greeted and immediately seated. The server came buy and asked if we have ever been and even though we had appetizers, we said no because appetizers do not count as a dining experience. So we got the 411 on PF chang's. The usual menu is set up family style where you order diahes to share with a group. Sonce there were only 2 of us, there is the PF Chang's for 2 option with select dishes to choose from and share. It seemed like a good deal, so that is what we ordered. I cant remember exactly but i think that option is around $45. We got a noodle dish, mongolian beef, and chicken lettuce wraps. It also came with soup and a dessert. For the soup,  i ordered the egg flower soup and my sister originally had the hot sour one. She didnt like it and the server waa nice enough to switch it to the egg flower soup. The dessert was ok. We also ordered edamame, which was pretty good. Our server was great! The food was alright, but im not sure if the food was worth the price. I'm not sure if I'd come back again. Only of i was woth a larger group where i can pick and have a little bit of everything!",91403

Chang's since I was a kid but for some reason almost every location, especially this one, has terrible service. I can't even begin to explain the experiences I've had but this last time was for sure the last time I'll ever go there. I went for lunch with my family and they weren't even busy. Our waiter approaches us with low energy but I assumed he's just having a bad day and let it go. Then, I ordered double pan fried noodles with BEEF and he looks at me confused and I had to tellhim that it's not on the menu but I always get it and the chefs know what it is. After, he comes back and asks me if I wanted chicken or pork in it and I reminded him that I wanted beef. Later they bring our soup and it's COLD and I even let that go but I was getting frustrated at this point. Then I see that there's dried up vegetables in my bowl and ask another waiter to bring me a new one and she only brings me a bowl with no freaking spoon. I ask our waiter to get me a spoon for my soup and he brings me a huge metal spoon you use to pour the soup, not eat with. It doesn't end there. My mom asked for lemon 2 times, and once to the manager and the manager told us to wait 5 minutes. UHHH FOR WHAT? After 5 minutes my mom told our waiter we'd been waiting for over 10 minutes for just some damn lemon and he has the balls to ask us ""well did you tell anyone?"" I'm like ""we told you AND the manager""... and he says ok and leaves to get it. I have never in my life had such bad service like this. I can't even believe the managers service..The only thing that kept me coming back is their food but apparently that's gone down the hill too especially for their prices. I'm not surprised the location in Burbank only had 3 stars and closed down. Do not come here.",91403

Aside from that there were big chunks of mushroom and practically no chicken. It was pretty gross, the mushroom chunks felt slimy. The lo mein and the Mongolian beef were also horrible.

I finally got fed up went to the manager and let her know what was going on but unfortunately 45 minutes had passed already. The manager Teresa was very understanding of what was going on she discounted our meal but unfortunately even after that it took additional 20 minutes to get someone to come by and pick up the check so we could pay.Teresa was very apologetic but at this particular point in time we were past the apology stage we have never gone to a restaurant and receive such horrible service. My recommendation is not to ever go to this particular PF Changs we have dined at many other PF Changs and never receive this type of lack luster service. At the end of our dinner we had the box our own food I have never gone to a PF chains were we had to box our own food what kind of service is that?

A few minutes later, not even 5, he walked over and asked if we have been there before or had any questions.

The shrimp fried rice and lo mein were very tasty and mildly flavored which worked with the meat dishes we ordered. Popular dishes at my table were the chicken lettuce cups and chicken satay. The chinese chicken salad and spicy green beans were my favorite. Located by shopping and movies, this is a good place to bring family for dinner or lunch on a weekend. The waiter we had was very friendly. This location also has an outside patio. I like that they also offer brown rice as a side, not only white rice.

Wow.  *Astonishingly* bad rice (I'd be shocked if they used proper short-grain sushi rice vs. just their leftover white rice) -- it was mashed into a thin layer and then wrapped around mediocre tempura shrimp.  The syrupy sweet sauce on one of them was drizzled sparingly, another was heavier, and one looked like a ladle was used -- I mean, there were puddles of it leftover afterwards.  This was definitely the worst ""Chinese"" dining experience I've had in a decade -- and it was nearly $80.  There are a better options than P.F.

And he did admit to me that if his parents (who used to own a Chinese restaurant) ever found out that we ate at a PF Chang's, they would disown him. I guess we both had reputations to protect ;DThe staff...excellent! Friendly! Helpful! ...and not bad on the eyes :)The food...friggin' delicious! Maybe slightly more oily or salty than what I prefer but only by a tiny fraction. We basically ordered tea, one appetizer, one entrée, and a bunch of half order side dishes.

We got concerned, because we had tickets to a 8:30pm movie and now our dinner time was about to be cut significantly short. We made the host aware of our plans and he still said we would have to wait. This seemed extremely odd, since the restaurant was only at maybe 40% occupancy and no one else appeared to be waiting for a table. We decided to head to the bar and get a head start on our drink and appetizer order while we waited. That 20 minute ""back up"" turned into 30 minutes and we were finally seated at our table at 7:30pm. We immediately ordered our entrees when our waiter first came to us. Entrees weren't served until 8:10pm, 40 minutes after we ordered, and we had to bug our waiter to keep checking on them.

Most dumb Americans think this glop is Chinese food. I stayed safe and just ordered the hot and sour soup, which did not arrive hot at all. What it did arrive with was day-old chicken in it. You know , when they chop up chicken breast in the morning, put it in a metal bin to use it in all the chicken dishes for the day, but has that stale taste because it's been exposed to air for 12 hours?. Gross.My date ordered the sweet and sour chicken, with brown rice. It also arrived lukewarm. But worse was the doughy , gooey, flavorless breading. Many pieces had no chicken at all.This place was only 40% full, so the food should have at the very least arrived hot. Factory chain store food is just no longer acceptable.

First of all, we got in at 6:20PM and we were told that happy hour now ends at 6PM instead of 7PM. Okay, that was disappointing, but we stayed anyway. We sat at the bar as we normally do and we had the best of both worlds. The left TV monitor was the Golden State Warrior Game and on the right TV monitor the first game of the Stanley Cup Championship game with the Sharks and the Penguins was on. We ordered our drinks and it was awesome. About 15 minutes later, the manager, a little guy with glasses came and changed the right TV monitor to the Warrior Game for these big dudes. We told him that we were watching that. He just said sorry and attempted to change the channel on the left TV monitor to the Sharks game. It took him forever and the people sitting behind him told him not to change it because they were watching. Here's the thing, we were there first and have been watching for almost 20 minutes. I've worked in places like this before, it's common courtesy to ask others if they are watching it before changing it. We would have been happy to switch seats so everyone could be happy. So, I told him to cancel our order and we just paid for our drinks and left. Can you believe it was almost 20 minutes and we still haven't even gotten any of the appetizers or food we ordered?

We got lucky and got sat in their private party room by the window. Even though the content of the view itself wasn't anything amazing as it was just Sepulveda Blvd it was nice to be sat next to one where you had to option to look outside. This place was especially great because they had a menu dedicated for gluten free dishes.  Plus, the service was great. We ordered the gf Philip's Better Lemon Chicken that comes with broccoli. It was so yummy! It had the perfect tangy to go with the savory chicken that was lightly battered with gluten free batter. Delish! We also ordered the Beef with Broccoli and that was good too, especially because the beef was high quality instead of the rubbery & chewy texture you might get at other places.   I am a fan of PF Chang's Gluten Free Menu!",91403

This trip, we went for an early dinner on a Sunday night. Got there about 5:30 - a 15 to 20 minute wait...hmmmm that is odd as the restaurant was practically empty.  When our little buzzer went off we went up to the hostess station. She smiled, but didn't say anything. My friend stood there for a few minutes waiting for her to say something...but no. So my firend said, ""I think our table is ready"".  The hostess said ""yes"" and we all stood there. Eventually a waiter/host came and got us and took us to our table. He was great. He alerted us to the special menu and even got me some wooden chopstix (the new ones are too slick for me).Our waiter was very nice. He took our order and off he went. We had ""the usual"" pan friend dumplings (vegetable), spring rolls and brown rice. I ordered the new special beet salad - very good! I put up a picture. They forgot our rice and it took a while to find someone to get rice for us (not sure where our nice waiter went). I ordered decaf coffee...it was cold - bummer.  The food was good as usual. Know before you go....1) it can be REALLY CROWDED, there is a small bar area on the far side of the restaurant if you want to get a drink while you wait.2) you can get wooden uncoated (not slippery) chopstix - just ask3) they have lots of vegetarian items4) they validate parking so take your ticket with you (however, if you are going to the movies, validate there as you get 4 hours instead of 2)",91403

The manager I'm guessing (skinny short guy wearing a blue shirt) says annoyingly ""Oooookkkkk"". Ummm, ok....??? What's with the attitude dude? Bad day? We have a party of 8 and it's a problem for you to accommodate a party of 8 midweek when it's dead? Anyhow, not wanting this guy to ruin a nice impromptu family dinner, I let it go. The ambiance inside the restaurant is nice. Dim lighting, candles, etc. Our server was ok. Not great, not bad, just meh. He was pleasant enough but doesn't really have his serving etiquette down yet (for instance, he should be made aware that as a server, you don't throw napkins across the table to someone if you can't reach them; you walk around and place it down instead).  Overall we still had a nice dinner, ordered waaayyy too much food, but had a pleasant time nonetheless.

And they served me half of the glass. When I asked I got reply that since it was not ice, I will get only half of it. I did not know that I was paying 50% of price for ice. In other location I never saw they were giving me half of drink if I am ordering without ice. I paid full amount since I had decided not to visit here again.2. After my above experience , I still gave this location a chance. I had ordered noodles without mushroom. When I got a dish they forgot to take out the mushroom. Waitress brought me dish again. After eating half of a dish I had realized there was mushroom again. I pointed out the mushroom. Waitress asked me was I having allergies. I said doesn't matter since I had requested for dish without mushroom. Her reply was they put bunch of vegetable together, so mushrooms was part of the vegetables. I disagreed since I had specifically told them and they did same mistake again. They did not charge for the dish. I was not happy about should I have allergies to make my point right.

I have also been disappointed all 3 times. I've always had exceptional customer service at other locations but not this one, it would explain why they are never packed. Any other location has a wait of at least an hour no matter what day. Tonight was the last straw for me. Walked in and saw dirty utensils on our table. We also got our appetizers before our cocktails. Lastly we were waiting for our waitress to bring back our credit card, she comes to the table to tell us good night and I had to remind her she still had our credit card. The portions they give you here is much smaller than other locations. Trust me, I am familiar with their portions and their menu. I thought the first time that it was just an off night.

True story. I had made plans to go after a movie at Archlight, but sure enough, by the time I wanted to use it, it was lost. Dug through my desk looking for it to no avail so I never went. I just moved out of my apartment and happened to find it in my girlfriend's desk drawer ... Guess she's a clepto ... So once everything was cleared out we went for our final meal in LA before moving to ABQ. This was a meal nearly three years in the making! LOL.Well, not surprisingly, the food is subpar.

It took 20 mins to get our water, another 20 mins to get drinks. Another 25 mins for appetizers. 1 hour plus waiting and still no entree.

There is a Cheesecake Factory and an Arclight, so it's convenient for an impromptu night out. It was a little packed since it was dinner time on Saturday, but we were able to get a table pretty fast. The food is ok, but it's so expensive. You're better off going to a mom and pop Chinese restaurant and getting better tasting food for half the price. But I had a gift card, so this is why we were here. We got the PF Chang's meal for two. We each got a choice of soup, a choice of appetizer to share (steamed chicken dumplings), an entree each that includes rice, and a dessert. The hot and sour soup wasn't good at all. Way too salty and not at all sour or hot. It's usually my favorite soup, but not this time. I couldn't even finish it, yuck. The chicken dumplings were plated nicely and it was very good. We both got the house special chicken entree with brown rice and it was delicious, however it was too ""saucy"" for my taste. Our dessert we got the banana eggrolls served with ice cream. That was probably the best out of our whole meal. Very pleased with our waiter's suggestion. I give it one star not only for the mediocre, expensive food, but the service seriously lacked. We hardly saw our waiter. Only for our drinks and to take our order, and our dessert. I had to flag down other people's waiters to get some attention for our lack of refills. I could tell the other waiters were annoyed that I was doing that, but we had no attention from our waiter, so I had to do something. Also, I was disappointed in the way he wrote up our check. We got the PF Changs meal for two for $40, but instead he itemized everything and charged us individually, so instead of $40, we were charged $60. Uhhh...NO. Then it took us an extra 20 minutes to get the bill fixed. But even when we explained it to him, he didn't understand bc he was so distracted by something. He would look away and not look at me or my husband. Then he would ask us to repeat it. Terrible service. Don't think I would be back to this location.",91403

Whoever the manager is, I would highly suggest you read this review...I came in tonight (5/18/2017) at around 10 tonight. Me and my friend had a long day at work and wanted to grab some delicious food and a couple of cocktails to end the night. We go inside and the hostess (not sure what her name is but she was wearing a pink floral top) we ask how long the wait is and she says ""no wait right now"" grabs some menus and walks us over to our table. It wasn't very busy at all. We sit down look over the menus and no waiter. We decided on what we wanted...and still no waiter. As we're looking around everyone has been served and no one has yet come over to even say hi. The same hostess comes over to our table and says ""has anyone helped you guys yet?""We look around and say no....""well do you want to order drinks?"" My friend then looks at her and says ""are you the waiter?"" She goes no but proceeds to take our drink orders. She asks to see our ID's and of course without a problem we take them out to show her. She holds on to them for a quite awhile looking very confused. She walks away and we see her go to the kitchen talking to multiple waiters. And the waiters are looking back at us??? I mean. Is there a problem? We don't really know. 5 minutes later, a woman who appears to be the manager or someone of some importance comes over to us and says ""have you guys been helped?"" Now we're concerned. Yes, we look young, no we're not dressed up, yes we have money to pay for our meal is there an issue? We reply ""umm yes your hostess just took our drink order"" and then says ""did you show your id?"" Like cmon. You just saw her take our order and why is there a big production now with everyone coming over to our table making us feel uncomfortable. At this point my friend and I are annoyed, offended and just ready to go. My friend stops at the hostess desk to ask her what was that all about? All she could do was fabricate some silly excuse all while looking completely confused and unaware of what just took place. I've never been to a place to unprofessional. The customer service is non existent and I will be going to corporate about the matter. I don't know if it was because we were young, or if we were young and black.

It was served on an empty plate with no sauce. Just sloppily cut egg rolls with the insides spilling out. The presentation looked like someone else's leftovers.

Moral of the story is that this place is poorly managed and has horrible service. Good luck. Hopefully you'll have a better experience than us and not get ignored for 2 hours.",91403

Not sure why they'd even call it poke. Its $12 and sooooo small. Not worth the price AT ALL. I guess wontons are supposed to be the foundation instead of rice? Really didnt taste good. There was barely any seaweed salad and not to mention they didnt provide me chopsticks or a fork. Dont waste your mula!,91403

Yes I could have called room service but it's what the waitress said. She said they are out of spoons (which they should have told me in advance). Then she just stood there. So I asked if there is anything else and she offered a knife! Then when I explained I don't think I can eat a soup with a knife, she just said...  Then sorry! What makes me even more mad was that she was being so ditzy and smiling like thats none of her problem.Any retail store should have an excellent customer service so should not be representing the owners hard work.",91403

Yum.  We always get Chang's Spicy Chicken as one of our entrees and it's definitely a favorite.  Last time we tried the Beef a la Sichuan and didn't love it.  While the flavor was good, there was so little beef in the dish, we felt kinda ripped off.  Still, we usually really enjoy the food here.Also, I'm OBSESSED with their jasmine blackberry green iced tea.  It's delicious and so refreshing.  I wish I could find it in stores!!The dinner for two options is fantastic and a great deal.  People complain about the portion sizes but I am almost positive portions are larger if you just order a la carte.  So if you don't want a soup or an app, I would definitely recommend just going straight for the entrees.",91403

Wtf?!? They must have hoped i wouldn't have noticed it... well i did!

I have to say that most of the food was good. The problem is, things went wrong from the beginning. We never got table settings like napkins and silverware until probably 30 minutes after we were seated (and we had to ask twice). Our appetizers got to our table before we even had a fork to eat them with. That being said, those appetizers were pretty good once we were able to eat them. Pork dumplings, edamame (they give a lot), and lettuce wraps were all great appetizers. Moving on to the main course, I ordered the Chang's spicy chicken and brown rice. Chicken was fantastic, but the rice was obviously burnt and hard. When I told this to the waitress, she said that she thought it looked off when she served it. If you think the food looks burnt, you still go ahead and serve it?! I thought that was unbelievable.

My husband & I stopped going to any PF Chang's for at least a year because we didn't feel like the food & service was good. Today, I was craving fried rice & my husband said PF Chang's had good fried rice because his co-worker bought it for his work one time for lunch. I was skeptical, but I went ahead & said yes, let's give PF Chang's another chance. We get there around 2pm & there was probably no more than 15 guests. Great! I hate crowds! We got seated right away & I noticed that they completely changed their menu. The entire menu was unrecognizable. They got rid of my favorite Dan Dan noodles which I was looking forward to ordering besides the fried rice. So I thought ""Fine, I'll give them the benefit of the doubt. Maybe the new menu is better."" They now serve sushi & Thai dishes. This made me realize ""Wow, they are confused more than ever!"" Is PF Chang's Chinese, Japanese or Thai?! Anyway, I was still open to trying the new menu. So we ordered combination fried rice, calamari & sautéed spinach with garlic. The fried rice was nothing special. I've had better in Chinatown or from our favorite Chinese food delivery place. The calamari was anything BUT calamari. First of all, it's unrecognizable calamari. My husband said ""Where's the tentacles? That's the best part!"" They look like the ""popcorn""' that's used to stuff packages but a lot thinner. It tasted bland on it's own. Didn't even taste or look like squid. It came with salt with sesame seed & sauce on the side. First of all, the salt didn't even stick to the calamari. And second of all, the sauce didn't taste good with the calamari. I ate it with their chili sauce because hot sauce makes everything taste better. The spinach... Well, that's all it was... Spinach. My 7 year old daughter could have made it with her eyes closed. While eating our meal, I couldn't help thinking ""We should've just gone to Chinatown to get some real friend rice & squid/calamari. We would've gotten our money's worth."" Our server was very nice. He was attentive and pleasant. I write reviews in hopes that things change for the better because I want people & places to succeed. I hope PF Chang changes for the better. Perhaps bring back their old menu & just make it better. Perhaps they can make up their mind, are they Chinese, Japanese or Thai because quite honestly, the competition for Chinese, Japanese & Thai food is very stiff in the neighborhood. There are a lot of Japanese & Thai restaurants in the neighborhood that are true to their cuisine and sticking to what they do best. I hope PF Chang's go back to their Chinese roots and just make it better.",91403

275,"15301 Ventura Blvd Ste P-22 Sherman Oaks, CA 91403",Richard L.,"Panorama City, CA",6/18/2016,1,"Well...this review is not a positive one. I was a guest of my daughter and son with their family for dinner in honor of Father's Day. We went on Saturday at 6 for dinner. I arrived on time and was seated. My kids were stuck in traffic. So I decided to order an appetizer.To be fair, our first choice was Hugo's. But they had been fully booked. And I have a new eating plan. Low fat, whole food, plant based. It is for my health supported by my doctor. I had looked up their menu ahead of time and found two things that I thought would work.Yesterday I had ordered spring rolls in Chinatown. They were made with rice paper wrap, softened in hot water and wrapped around vegetables and rice noodles. I have ordered them before at other Asian restaurants. They differ from egg rolls because they are not fried.P.F. Chang's had an egg roll selection with pork. Not for me. Then they had vegetable spring rolls listed. They sounded good. I missed the word crispy. I thought it referred to the julienne carrots or cabbage. When I gave the server my selection, I said that I had to avoid oil and things cooked in oil. She said that spring rolls were fried. I replied to tell the cook to just use water. She said they were always fried. I said, oh no, spring rolls are never fried in Los Angeles. Egg rolls are fried.I should have believed her. The runner brought fried egg rolls. I requested to speak to a chef. Nobody came. By then my daughter had arrived. She asked for the manager on duty. He, the glasses guy, came over, was very polite, and explained that they call them spring rolls because their egg rolls have pork. Remember the name tag, China Bistro. Funny.So I said just bring me bread. They don't have bread, so he said they had rice. I replied, bring me rice.Rice did not come either.Oh well, I guess that he felt he had done his job.Finally we ordered entrees. I ordered the Buddha's Feast with steamed vegetables and no sauce, as instructed by their menu. And brown rice.I did receive them in time. On the positive side, the brown rice was good. And we we provided chop sticks without asking. Nice. And I did have a nice mixed drink.The steamed Buddha's Feast was a disappointment, mostly. The ingredients were mixed in preparation and quality. The two good ones were the tofu and the shiitake mushrooms. Delightful. The broccoli was green and plentiful, but was undercooked quite a bit. Not quite raw. But not cooked much. The carrots were nicely cut. But they were also seriously undercooked. The asparagus was both a mystery and not edible. All thin stalk. Not cooked. Too fibrous to be able to chew. Not quite bamboo. But close.Did I complain? No. I did not want to further put a damper on the time together. The staff was excellent. The manager must have forgotten that I wanted rice immediately to replace the dish that was wrong. No crime. Just not perfect.Wok cooking can be really tasty. But if you are eating by the guidance of John McDougall, Cardston Esselstyn, T. Colin Campbell, Dean Ornish, or Neal Barnard, find a different restaurant or bring a sack lunch.",91403

They seem to hire people who are not knowledgeable of their menus or basic service practices. Maybe people who have never had prior experience? We came in when it was empty at 10 pm on a Friday and the total time took about two hours. The waiters were wandering off, and the food took forever to come out and oddly came out cold. We had to repeatedly ask for the same things over and over.

I would mark 0 but I had to put a star to review!!!When taking my order over the phone Togo for shrimp Kong pao they incorrectly placed it. I am a very strict pescatarian!!!  When receiving my order I paid for it and went to sit with my family that decided to dine in. I opened the box then realized the order was incorrect. Instead of the shrimp kong Pao I received chicken Kong pao. Very disappointed! I hen complained to manger DAVID MORALES , who quickly told me that for replacing my order I would be up charged since the shrimp is 1$ more. I felt in my many years of customer service he handled the situation very very poorly. He did not express remorse and stated that ""I would need to pay for the upcharge for a better product!"" Wowwwwwwww it he serious!!!!???? Really they should have comped it. Did he even take in mind that if I had left with my Togo order I would've Made it home to see the wrong order . Then have to o back an waste gas for their mistake!!!! HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE !!!!! Do not go to this P.F. Chang if u want to be treated with respect!!!

The manager came over to apologize and offered to take care of any dry cleaning. I told him that don't worry about the dry cleaning. These are washable. So after we finish eating. They brought the bill back and took off one item. I had hot soup spilled on me, food got cold and I'm sitting in wet clothes and now have to go home and wash them. I talked to the manager and he said he'll take care of it. So he took everything off but the ribs. Why leave the ribs on? I was a partner in 2 restaurants and if something like that happened.

He in fact went ahead and never returned but did  comp (credit) us for the apetizers. It was like he did not want to deal with the matter 4-12-15 at 3.30 pm.   The food was so bad and that Managment did not even show up later to check on our experience.  F-The waitress disappeared and you could tell both from the body language of the manager and the watiress that they would rather be somewhere else than here. It was bizarre because they had a who gives a beep attitude if you follow me.  They did switch our waitress  with another waiter. We waited so much for nothing and and eventually told them that we were tired of waiting and were going to leave the establishment.  Within minutes the food turned up.  The food was not hot at all. It was actually horrible. It was prepared with so much salt  and left waiting under the heat lamp for so long before the remaining dishes were prepared, not to mention it  was awful. P.F.

That's a decent amount of time for a place like this on a Friday night or so we thought. The nice lady and gentleman in the front tell us it's a 40 min wait. So we wait although we did question the amount of empty tables inside and out but sure maybe they're short staffed. That happens, we can understand that. We're waiting right outside the door and in the two times one person from the party went inside for the restroom we asked, ""will you be calling names outside?"" And both responses were, ""yes of course."" So we wait patiently outside and finally around 10:36p, I asked nicely where we were on the list since no one was inside nor outside waiting and parties amongst parties were leaving. A gentleman I hadn't seen before along with the original two looked at me dumbfounded and said, ""we could seat you right now."" No apology, nothing. Well okay we were forgotten about and it was pretty obvious at that point. Let's move on to being seated... We sit, the first thing the server tells us, ""what would you like from the kitchen, it closes in 20mins? I want to make sure you get what you want."" That just put the cherry on top.

Honestly my party of four was not rude but courteous to the waiter - but if you are having a bad day it does not reflect well on the establishment. We came in on a Saturday night looking to grab a quick dinner before watching the Wolf of Wall Street. PF Changs had the shortest wait of the restaurants in the mall so we went for it. We were seated in less than ten minutes. Great! And set our minds on the lettuce wraps, honey glazed chicken, mongolian beef, and chicken fried rice. The waiter taking our orders was not very responsive or friendly - and had a smug attitude the entire time he was either taking our orders or serving us. Major douchebag! When I told him we were ready to order and when we were ready to pay he rolled his eyes as if I was a snooty girl in a hurry. Onto the food, nothing was special about any of it. The lettuce wraps were probably the best dish out of everything we ordered. The honey glazed chicken was way too dry and hard to eat, the mongolian beef was too salty/oily for my taste, and the fried rice was just plain oily.I never want to go to PF Changs but this has been my second time because of a group thing. Really really overrated for the price. Avoid if possible.",91403

Chang's is sad -- we liked them when they were good, and tolerated them for far too long when they were going downhill.I don't know what they're like now, and I will never go back nor recommend them to anyone, ever.  Life is just too short to eat crappy food indifferently served in a restaurant that needs a serious cleaning.Eat there at your own risk, but what a terrible waste of time.  (Yelp, you need to allow us to rate ""zero"" stars.

Whoever they are have absolutely no fucks to give.

Finally our server came by and we put in our order right away.Our apps and soup came out in a reasonable time, then we waited a while for our dinner and then waited a significant amount of time for the server to come by so we could ask about our dessert, which was part of our initial order. We then waited another 10 minutes for the dessert and when it finally came asked for the bill too, so we didn't have to wait until we saw him again.My only water refill in those 2 hours was by the manager. Other than that, we never saw our server except for when we first ordered, when we flagged him down about dessert and when he dropped back off our check. We had to flag him down to take the check too.I'm sure that our situation didn't make it any better, being that I am pregnant and due in a few weeks so it was a long time to sit and by 10pm I was exhausted. That ended up frustrating my husband too, who was spending most of his time trying to watch for the server to speed things up on my behalf.

I was really impressed.  Being a vegetarian, it's great to see that they've added a Vegetarian section. Our Waiter, Westley, was excellent, He made sure that we were attended to immediately, was polite and courteous and you could tell he really likes his job. Once the food arrived (and it was awesome) he checked back with us to make sure everything was okay -our glasses were always refilled promptly.  As the service was exemplary, I also thanked the Manager, Richie Elkin for doing such a great job, as typically, managers only hear complaints - it's probably nice to hear from the satisfied customers, once in a while, too!  Curry Vegies, green beans, asparagus were perfectly prepared and tasty!  Thank you to the staff and management (and the Chef's, too!) for making this a really nice evening!  Great job! We'll be back again, soon!   Happy Holidays!",91403

Don't get me wrong, they were good, just not worth the high prices. It is not like the quality of the shrimp were anything unattainable.The ribs did not taste fabulous and were actually pretty dry.The salt and pepper calamari came with a side of salt and pepper. I am not sure why, because they were EXTREMELY salty as it is. Taste like a stick of salt(Yes, they were in a type of stick form). The only thing I ordered that was good were the duck spring rolls.On a bright side, their chocolate cake with raspberry puree was fabulous.

326,"15301 Ventura Blvd Ste P-22 Sherman Oaks, CA 91403",Sophia C.,"Los Angeles, CA",11/11/2011,4,"So with a guialo of a husband that wanted Chinese food, but not the hardcore shit, we walked here after a long day of work from our respective jobs.We went straight for the dinner for two fixed price meal, ~$40 which included choice of soup for each, one appetizer, 2 entrees and a shot of mini dessert.The hot and sour soup was nothing to write about, nor was the egg drop soup. Being asian...those soups are clearly for the ""non-asian"" clientele.Now...the lettuce wrap appetizer...was actually quite good! The hubby wea leary of it...and ended up being eating most of it, even when we ran out of the lettuce and just ate the meat portion. Seasoned just right and came out piping hot. That's not bad PF Changs.Entrees turned out to be a B grade. We ordered the orange chicken (hubby's choice) and Mongolian beef (moi). Orange chicken was nothing spectacular...but the Mongolian beef was pleasantly surprising. It came pretty damn close to authentic Mongolian beef that you'd have at the hardcore Chinese restaurants through SG Valley: seared outside, juicy inside with a hint of peppercorn. I loved that it came with green onions, the husband doesn't eat it...so more for me!Mini desserts were the great wall of chocolate and tiramisu. Meh...the sweet topped off a not too shabby meal.I'd give 3.5 for the meal but it gets the 4 stars for the great customer service we received. Guess towards the end of the meal, our waitress was refilling out waters when she accidently spilled some water on my purse. I didn't bat an eye, but I guess she's done that before in the past as she was horrified of spilling water on my purse the she kept apologizing. I kept saying no worries, it's friggin' water? Poor thing even went to her supervisor...who then marched up to our table to see if everything was ok with the purse. Checked again, just water, didn't destroy anything. The manager stated that due to the accident, he was going to comp the large sake we had ordered. Pssh...freebies? Sign me up!Paid the bill and got yet another apology from both the waitress and manager...and go handed a free complimentary appetizer coupon the next time we swing by.Wow...I would never have expected such corrective and prompt customer service from PF Changs. I might have to change my mindset of the place where my guailo husband and the most americanized taiwanese brother in law thinks this franchise serves the BEST asian food ever. I won't agree there, but PF changs does provide one of BEST customer service I've experienced anywhere.Yes, I shall be returning :D",91403

329,"15301 Ventura Blvd Ste P-22 Sherman Oaks, CA 91403",Joe H.,"Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, CA",6/28/2016,1,"Oh boy...my wife and I come to this Changs frequently.  It's close to home and usually our go-to spot for pre-movie dinner.  We are both creatures of habit and order 1 of 3 things every time we come.  Tonight was no different in that fact; I ordered chicken fried rice, and my wife ordered crispy honey chicken.  That's the general setting for when things really got bad, but let's back up a bit and set the scene a little.We walk in, the place is pretty empty, and we wait probably 5 minutes before being acknowledged.  That in and of itself is no big deal, they are obviously understaffed, it's turn over, generally a slower time for restaurants, no worries.  So the manager comes and seats us!  Perfect!  Well done there.  She takes our drink order and asks if we want to get some appetizers going.  We tell her we'll do the ""Changs for 2"" special which comes with a soup, choice of an appetizer, 2 entrees, and a desert for $42.  We order 2 egg flower soups and the chicken lettuce wrap for an app.  She gets those going and the soups come out in no time.  All is well.  Then she herself brings out 2 orders of lettuce wraps.  I even made the comment ""we get two now?"", and she walked away without a word.  She comes back to check on the appetizer and I ask, ""are we supposed to get two appetizers?"" She says, ""don't worry about it.  That was my mistake you guys can just keep it.""  I say ok and she starts to leave.  I stop her because we've yet to order the entrees and I ask if we can order them.  She says sure and takes our order.  (As a side note, she has yet to write anything down as far as our order goes.  Didn't write down our soup order, our appetizer order, or our entree order.). I ask if we could get a couple of small plates to put our lettuce wraps in and she says sure.  But we don't see her again until the entrees come out. As I said before, my wife ordered the crispy honey chicken (which she has done dozens of times before) and right away she notices it looks different.  She takes a bite and says ""this doesn't taste right.""  I try a piece and it is very clearly orange chicken.  It taste orange-y, the sauce is thicker, and....its just orange chicken.  So we flag down our server/the manager, and we tell her that we believe the dish to be orange chicken and not crispy honey chicken.  She says, ""I don't want to correct you, but that is crispy honey chicken.""  I said, ""well it has a very distinct orange flavor and isn't at all crispy..."" She then tells us that, ""a few guests have said the same thing today.  Maybe the kitchen has changed the recipe.""  She offers to get my wife something else but once again tells us that the dish is in fact crispy honey chicken.  So we say no thank you because we didn't have time to wait for another dish to be cooked as we were trying to catch a movie.  Come desert time, she asks what we would like.  I tell her that the standard desert that comes with the deal would be fine.  To which she says, ""well I know you didn't enjoy your entree too much so I can spice up desert if you want.""  I said, ""well that's true she didn't but no thanks.""  I was afraid if we orders anything else, we might end up with a whole cheesecake or something as opposed to what we ordered.  Desert and the bill come and the bill shows no attempt to monetarily rectify the situation and never once did she apologize for any food that tasted like a different food from which we ordered.  She acknowledged that it was obvious we didn't enjoy ourselves or the food and never apologized.  Just insinuated we clearly had no idea what we were talking about but that others had had the same reaction to that particular dish. Not for nothing, as server, I am familiar with the aloha POS system that they have there at Changs.  On our receipt, it showed that it had in fact been reprinted.  So, what is the more likely scenario?  That given how many mistakes she had made prior to the food coming out, and the fact that she wrote nothing down, wouldn't you agree there is more than a reasonable chance that she entered orange peel chicken, realized the mistake, struck that from the original receipt, rang in the honey chicken as a ""don't make"" and reprinted the check to give to us, hence the indication of a reprint?  Or could it be that the kitchen had sent out multiple orders of honey chicken that day and that multiple guests complained that it tasted like orange chicken and this manager didn't have an answer as to why that was happening to us and these other guests other than ""maybe they did something to the recipe""?  I don't think the latter is too plausible...but that's just me...",91403

Finally, I got up and told the host.  The manager (I think since he was the only one not in uniform), apologized and said he would comp our appetizers.  I said we'd already paid for those at the bar so then he said he'd ""take care of us.""  Well, our server came out quickly after that and said, ""Sorry, I don't know what happened.  We thought the people at the bar were taking care of you.""  WTF??  Why would the people at the bar take care of people who are now sitting in the main dining room, and when we'd already closed out our bill there?!?!  Anyway, we did get our food and our server seemed nice and ready to make amends.  I left her the customary tip which I regretted about 10 minutes later.  For reasons known only to herself, she'd taken our parking ticket to validate and hid it behind the bill receipts.  I didn't see it obviously and we walked out.  When I ran back to get it, she gave me attitude, saying in a rather rude tone, ""Oh well, you left it in the bill folder.""  I just stared at her and asked the obvious: ""Well, can you check to see if you still have it?""  She did and have it back to me.  Oh, and the kicker - absolutely NOTHING was comped on the dinner bill so the manager clearly didn't ""take care of us.""  Will I be going back to this location?  HELL NO.  Will I be recommending this location to anyone ever?  ABSOLUTELY NOT.  Take the extra 15 minute drive at enjoy yourself at the Woodland Hills location where I heartily wish we'd gone instead, and where I usually go.  The Sherman Oaks location is a complete and total mess, filled with rude and uncaring servers and managers who should be ashamed to say they're in the service industry.  I don't know what ""service"" they seem to think they're providing but it's complete and total crap.",91403

I told my friends that I would not go or would not want to try it on my own will. Last night my girlfriend and I were looking for a place to eat and PF changs happen to be the conveniant spot.Being my first time I was hoping to make the experience good. I was open minded about the style and dishes so I asked questions about the menu and read the descrptions for the entrees I was interested in. I noticed there was a running deal for a dinner for two. The special gave 2 soups, 1 appetizer, 2 dinner entrees, and 2 mini deserts. All for the price of $50, not to bad at all. We got both of the soups that were to choose from. Those were egg drop soup and spicy sour soup. The base for the egg soup was super thick and was not enjoyable. The spicy sour soup was ok but not agreeing to my taste palette. the two entrees we chose was the chang's spicy chicken and cantonese shrimp.  Both items were very bland and the chicken nearly hit the spicy mark.  The mini deserts were interesting. They were in a double shot cup and were decent as a meal ender.My whole opinion of negativity towards PF changs is that chinese food is not supposed to be expensive. Not to say that chinese food is cheap, but if you go to high populated chinese areas you will find great deals on even the expensive items such as crab, lobster, and steak.  The portions are usually ""family size"" and that is pretty much it. PF Changs does not supply nor emulate the chinese dinning experience. But hey if you want to express yourself by spending money at a place that is expensive to feel upper class that is fine by me. Traditional is way better in my opinion.",91403

Chang's the two times I've been here was excellent. I had no complaints. The food, however, is a different story.I was open-minded to P.F. Chang's when I first ate here with my boyfriend as I'd never eaten at any P.F. Chang's in my life and I don't believe I was biased against it. I first ordered the Mongolian Beef and it was very bland. I was quite underwhelmed. My boyfriend, who loves P.F. Chang's, also agreed with my assessment. I may have also gotten some fried rice which I thought a non-cook like me could have cooked better.The second time we ate here, I got the Kung Pao Scallops. It was okay, but much too salty and not enough good taste for me to enjoy. I wouldn't get it again. My boyfriend got his favorite crispy honey shrimp which was actually pretty tasty.In all, I couldn't believe we paid just over $50 for two okay-mediocre entrees and a lacking-in-taste appetizer. You can get much better Chinese food elsewhere. The only reason why I could justify having paid such a hefty price for such mediocre food was the restaurant's interior design and high rent.

So this review is not towards the waiter as he was great except it would take a while in between checking our drinks and such. It's for the overall experience. Got there and it wasn't that busy and was told it'll be a 5 minute wait and that's pretty accurate as we were seated a few minutes later. So the first thing I noticed when I sat was the greasy finger marks all over my plate? umm, eww. Whatever. I switched plates with the one next to me. The portions seem to be getting smaller while the prices keep going up. I ordered chicken lettuce wraps and we were 3 people and literally were given like 5 pieces of lettuce. I don't know, the overall experience was not pleasant like the one I receive at the Pasadena location which is the one I usually go to. I don't think I'll be back here.",91403

For the price everything should be a lot better! I had made a reservation on line-best part of the experience- for 6:30. Sure enough we arrived and our table was ready. Out waitress came to take our drink order shortly after sitting. We were really hungry so we started off by ordering a tempura shrimp roll along with our drink order. We then ordered soup, surf and turf and pad thai. Rather than brining out the rolls right away, she brought out the soup without even asking us if that is what we wanted. Fine. After some time the food came out and well was not super amazing. It was actually quite salty. The surf and turf was the best and the lobster tail was actually delicious but all the sauces were extremely salty. The pad thai was not good. Salty. Warnings to anyone who has blood pressure concerns. The entire experience was meh and to be honest, I am not sure such reviews do anything for management as they feel protected by the name. There are far better fusion options that do not cost as much and actually taste beyond salty. Not sure if we will be returning.",91403

I've been in the hospitality industry for ten years. Started casual. Moved up to managing. Now in fine dining. But I still like to visit casual dining with friends etc. last night, we sat at the bar because we were trying to make a movie. The busser in bar was sweet and helped clear table quickly. We told waitress that we were in a rush and that well put in our order and then have the check when foods dropped. No problem. She did just that and was quick and attentive on refills.The problem I had, was how she handled the hair in our food situation. We found a hair in our chicken lettuce wraps. When we told her. She stared at us for a long while then asked if we wanted another one. We were not looking for a free meal. We just wanted the situation to be addressed. Hair in food is not okay. there was not much remorse or apologies. She just took it away and sent out a new one. I was expecting a manager to come by but they never did. The check was dropped. We were charged for the hair lettuce wraps and the new order she put in. I asked her nicely if she could fix it and she hastily walked away with it. The check got adjusted and one of the lettuce wraps were taken off. Then the manager comes by. I was shocked when he threw his staff under the bus. The server was right there and he blamed it on her that he didn't know about the situation tell that moment. Yes, that may be true. She may have been at fault and not told management. Although, as a manger, you are responsible for the situation and you NEVER push blame onto your staff your responsible for. It's unprofessional. He looked rushed. And the comments he made were robotic and not sincere. As a manager, I would want the guest to leave happy. I would have taken the time to spot by tables and check on them and if I found this situation out I would have taken both lettuce wraps off bill and probably sent out dessert. But that's just me. I love what I do. Not everyone loves their job. Very very disappointed PF changs. I'll stick to the Pasadena location from now on.",91403

Than while I was waiting at the bar for my take out order the bartender Mathew was amazing and super helpful as well your lucky to have him  . I work in a restaurant/ Bar at the Roosevelt Hotel, so i know good customer service and he was better than half of the people I've worked with .

Unfortunately for me, the only lasting memory I was left with was food poisoning.Admittedly P.F. Chang's has a very modernly stylish ambiance; with dim lighting, provided by large ring-shaped lights, and asian-inspired decoration in the form of statues and paintings. However the decoration isn't able to distract you from the poor service. Interestingly though this is one of the few instances where the service was poor due to its absence, however, as opposed to some sort of negative interaction.Upon entering we informed the hostess of our arrival, as we had a reservation, and headed to the bar. Before our drinks were even made our table was ready, and shortly thereafter we were sat. To our dismay, we sat unattended for 15 minutes before flagging down a server. Realizing the error of their ways, one of the managers took care of our table for the remainder of the night--providing rather good service.The food was quite good, which I expected considering the rather high prices. We ordered a varied assortment of appetizers and entrees that were all well portioned. Everything was flavorful, and provided an interesting spin on your usual (Americanized) Chinese meals.This wouldn't be my first choice for Chinese food (I'm more of a mom 'n' pop Chinese place type of guy anyway), but after spending a miserable night/morning it is now my last. I will probably give P.F. Chang's another chance though... at a different location.",91403

We were greeted and seated right away. Our waiter was very knowledgeable and with his help I was able to order something off them menu that I knew wouldn't make me sick.

Anyway - we arrived no one even said hi to us until we said hi. We asked how long the wait would be and one of the hostesses said no wait at all. That hostess walked away, another one asked for a name. I told her my name but looked at my husband  and said, if theres no wait, why do they need my name? I thought ooh maybe its part of the restaurant experience lol. Then she tells us to wait and take a seat. We waited ten minutes and then got a seat. I totally don't mind a ten minute wait but don't tell me theres no wait. None of this bothered me much because it wasn't worth going more into. We were seated and a girl in training + her trainer helped us. They were very nice and helpful. We ordered vegetarian fried rice, egg rolls and broccoli beef entrée. Egg rolls were very good. The waitress came back and asked us if we wanted egg in our friend rice and we said 'yes please' and she told her trainer as well. After we started to eat we noticed it had no egg. Was going to ignore it but it didn't taste how I like it with egg so we asked a different waitress who had asked how our meal was about the egg. She asked if we wanted it a side of egg to put in and we agreed. It was about 15 min and no one came buy and our rice was cold. Finally got attention of manager and she was very kind and said they were making us a new entree instead of egg on the side. I understand that part it would've been nice for someone to tell us before. She ensured us a new order was in and almost done and that we wouldn't be charged for the rice. That was nice. I left a tad annoyed because we were just so hungry but I was over the situation.Then, we got home, started to eat the new rice and bam, no egg..again.Won't be back.

I expected there to be a wait since this location is in the heart of Sherman Oaks and is located in the Sherman Oaks Galleria. Since it was such a pretty day, I told them that we would be okay with first available (inside or outside) We were originally told the wait would be about 25min, but that was not the case. Lets just say, after 40min, we decided to go to the bar and order a few cocktails while we continue to wait. Obviously there was nowhere to sit, and thats not even mentioning that their bar was under staffed. There were to guys running from one end to another; making the drinks, placing food orders, and in charge of the carry out as well. I kid you not, we stood there and watched this one bartender begin to make a drink, get pissed half way in, dump the cup out, grab another cup and start over. After he did that about 4 times, he then began getting really upset & yelled.... ""Are you $%&@ing kidding me?"" No one was kidding about anything and when he realized that all 4 of us were watching him, he said, ""Oh sorry about that. Your drinks are coming right up."" At that given time, my thoughts were.... I LONGER WANT A DRINK!! Sixty five minutes later, we were finally seated and at that moment we had more than enough time to decide what we wanted for dinner, and change our mind 14 times if we wanted to. The reason why I actually and only rated this place with 2 stars is because our waiter who was a new waiter and still being trained; did a pretty decent job with making sure everything arrived pretty quick so that we could finally eat our dinner and get the heck out of there. Now I know why I'm not a fan of these cookie cutter places and would much rather find & support unique places. I'm good if I never eat at PF Changs ever again!!",91403

I am so sadly disappointed by the fall of PF Changs in Sherman Oaks!!   Use to be one of my favorite local haunts but our experience yesterday left me never wanting to return.  Began with the most disappointing Chicken Lettuce Wraps (which is PF Changs claim to fame no less).  Apparently they have a new policy where they cut the lettuce into quarters or possibly even eighths.  So you get tiny pieces of lettuce not big enough to wrap.  We then ordered the Oolong Chilean See Bass and Pad Thai.  Both arrived cold initially. The fish (a $25 dish no less) was tough, overcooked, but sitting on a bed of almost raw spinach.  We returned the food only to be given a replacement meal where the fish again was tough and overcooked.  The pad thai -- another claimed fan favorite by PF Changes  -- was served with the noodles undercooked al dente?The one shining star was our server Kimberly who immediately offered to replace the dishes with new ones.  This however was spoiled by a manager who stopped by with what felt like a most insincere apology. To top off the awful dining experience we were given fortune cookies WITHOUT any fortunes, and then given the left overs in take home boxes of such poor quality -apparently are meant to hold any sort of liquid. Both dishes leaked out of the boxes all over the car and us in the 10 minutes to took to get from the restaurant to our car and home only a mile awayBut for Kimberely I wish that a NO STAR review was an option.",91403

I'm making myself hungry ....The list goes on, but this is good stuff, guys. Reservations are always a good idea, but expect to wait 10 to 15 minutes longer. To off set that, though, you won't be waiting long for your meal. It's an open floor plan so it's going to be noisy, but that just everyone is having a good time.Beastly advise: They're part of the Sherman Oaks galleria so parking is not a problem. They do validate, but as the hostess told me, if you're planning on going to the Arc Light theater then get your ticket validated there. For unknown reasons Changs doesn't validate as long as Arc Light.",91403

OK, with that said, let's start the complaining.  1. Not the fault of the wait staff but the temperature must have been set at 85 degrees.  It was ridiculously hot.  2. I ordered a 12 dollar glass of wine and I surely don't remember requesting to having it served in a dirty glass.  Not just dirty, but there was food caked on the inside of the glass and not just on one spot but in several spots.  It was like brail inside half of the glass.  Yes, I sent it back immediately but that's not the point. 3. We ordered soup and rice and two entrees.  Yup, the soup came out about three minutes after the rice and the entrée. Awesome.  Thanks for that wonderful attention to detail  FAIL.  4. And this is stupid and picky but it just goes along with the whole theme of crappy service and not a care in the world about customer satisfaction.  Our candle on our table was not lit.  I looked around and saw that there were about 25 percent of the tables with unlit candles.  If I'm paying 15 bucks for some fried rice and chicken I want a friggin lit candle on my table. If you're going to spend in the 60 to 100 dollar range for dinner choose another place as to spend that kind of money in this place is like paying for a Mercedes and getting a Ford Pinto.  Sorry P.F, just telling it like it is.",91403

The food was delicious and our waiter could not have been more kind or attentive. The reason for only 3 stars is the unprofessionalism of the 3 hostesses. I walked up to the host stand with a parking ticket in my hand and waited for them to acknowledge me, which they did not. They carried on their conversation without even glancing my way.

One of us typically gets on Yelp and we find a joint we've never tried before. The boys are always game for trying something new. Yes, sometimes we hit a clunker, but the adventure is half the fun.Warning: I'm putting on my Male Chauvinist Pig Hat (it's kind of a combination Stetson, Cheese Head, Viking, beer dispenser thing). Sorry, ladies.The other day, we invited one of our female coworkers to go along with us. We had a new place all picked out, but she immediately started whining. Dammit if we didn't let her change our lunch destination to PF Chang's!Everybody knows how I feel about chain restaurants. I was also pretty disappointed about ending up at PF Chang's, so I had them in my gun-sights to begin with. Thus, my totally unbiased score for this place is a 2.5. Here's why:1) The friendly staff earns two of those stars. The waitress was on top of things and did a great job.2) Decent decor. Clean dining room.3) The food was okay, but nothing spectacular. I've certainly had better at many little family operated Chinese restaurants. I got the beef and broccoli and it wasn't very flavorful. We had lettuce wraps for an appetizer and that didn't ring my bell in the taste department either.4) The prices are a tad...pricey.Anyway, if I have any say in the matter, some certain Little Miss Somebody isn't getting a repeat lunch invite.

Also, when serving fried bananas, you're not supposed to use regular bananas it's just wrong.  (trust me, I know my fried desserts).- Service was excellent though.I guess the lesson here is only get what you know is good because if you get too many items and most are just OK it will make your experience, just OK.",91403

I really felt like leaving the restaurant that instant when another restaurant employee was walking by and asked if everything was ok (I'm not sure if he's the manager).  I told him about the high chair and it was nice of him to have it replaced with a decent one, I'd give him the props for that.The gesture made us stay... although we regret that after receiving the slowest service ever.  Our waitress needs to get classes on ""Time Management 101"".  She's nice but she can put you to sleep.Happy me?  I don't think so.",91403

I was only there for 10 minutes because I had called it in in advance. The restaurant validated my parking but when I got to the gate, I owed $3. I go to the Starbucks at the Sherman Oaks Galleria all the time and they validate and there's no parking cost. I just called the restaurant and the woman I spoke to didn't know that PF Chang's DOES validate for 2 hours at no cost. She directed me to the parking office who gave me this information. So the man at the to-go counter who validated my ticket and handed it back to me either didn't validate it or did it wrong or their validation machine isn't working. I called the restaurant to speak to a manager to tell them something isn't working and spoke with Laurel who was very kind but said they hadn't had any other problems. Probably they have but people aren't calling about $3. Unfortunately for me it's a treat to get the dessert (one I can't really afford but I'd had a really bad night at my restaurant job and splurged). Laurel said she'd buy me a dessert the next time I'm in but I don't eat dinner out because I can't afford it so while a nice offer, doesn't really help. I'd rather just have my $3 back. Anyway, MAKE SURE you check the validation and see that it's on the ticket. THEY DO VALIDATE FOR 2 HOURS AT NO COST so when you get to the gate, if the machine says you owe $$, press the button to speak with someone or go back to the restaurant.

Chang's before), instead of just pointing to that part of the menu, Matthew explained each tea in great detail, from memory.  He recommended a particular tea that Jeff loved -- the white tangerine.  It was surprisingly earthy and spicy.  He was so knowledgeable about the cuisine, and he seemed to be a foodie who really loved working there.  He recommended a new butternut squash dumpling appetizer, which was divine, and he also recommended the Mongolian Beef, which Jeff loved.  I got the Crispy Honey Shrimp, which is one of my favorite things on the menu.  We had a time constraint and needed to be out of there in an hour to catch our movie, so Matthew made sure that we got everything we needed right away, including bringing the check right when our entrees arrived.  He shared our excitement about seeing Star Wars, and said he was planning to see it the next day.  Our entire dining experience was delightful because of Matthew, and it was the perfect precursor to seeing that incredible film!",91403

So it works for a movie date. :-) It is unquestionably not the most authentic or best tasting Chinese you'll have, but anyone who dines out even just a little should know that.  But it's not like I'll b*tch if I get a pre-paid gift card for my birthday, say.  ;-)I've tried their honey chicken and honey shrimp, which are very tasty, as well as the orange chicken at some point and I recall stealing from my bf's Mongolian beef. I do remember the Mongolian beef wasn't very good...All plates come with a side of either white steamed rice or brown rice. I always have the brown rice and I mix it up with one of their table spicy sauces just to give it a twist. Try it!One thing they do great is the banana tempura with ice cream. Best I've tried yet. So even if you want to have dinner at a more authentic Chinese place, you can have dessert at P.F. Chang's and catch a movie right after. :-)",91403

I wish I asked for their names.  I hate to be such a mean person. Last night was one of the worst services my fiancé and I received at this location, as were here ever weekend!!! Our experience started with front desk saying it'll be an hour wait, and we were fine with waiting. However they were able to accommodate us sooner which is great because we were starving. Moving on to getting the table and being seating our waiter approached us and he was great.... Took our order and repeated it... And then 30 mins later still haven't gotten our waters with lemon, I asked for soups but got our lettuce wraps before the soups and our dinner arrived before the soups. Every single time the waiter approached us I had to remind him about the soups and ask where our garlic noodles were, since we had all of the other plates. Best of all we didn't get any dinner plates to eat off of, only the plates the Kung pau chicken came in. HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO EAT OUT OF THAT. So fast forward to about 45 mins we received our soups and my little spoon was dirty and at this point I'm starving because we still haven't gotten plates or our garlic noodles. I asked for another spoon and again second spoon is dirty. I gave up and finally said can we get dinner plates to eat on at least ? And the guy brings plates that were dirty! And had someone elses food on there. How gross? We ended up asking for every item to go and left very upset.

The hostess was a young unpleasant girl who didn't care to be there, and the waiter was just the same. I guess I can't blame them because it was 11:00pm (they closed at midnight). All the plates and cups were dirty - they felt gritty, as if they were just rinsed and left to dry. I even picked off particles from our water glasses and our tea cups (inside and out). The plates felt like they had sauce residue on them (i.e. sticky residue). It was... disgusting.When I asked the waiter why the plates were dirty, he replied, ""Ya, that's kinda just how they are..."". SERIOUSLY?? Are you kidding me? We're eating off these plates. He should've just apologized and replaced them... Anyway, he brought us new plates, tea cups and water glasses, and they were still dirty (except my tea cup which was warm, as if it was just taken out of the dishwasher)...The server's shift ended, and the server that took over asked how everything was, and I told him about the dishes/cups, and he replied a little more professional with this - ""Yes, sometimes the soap leaves that residue, it's a really strong soap and sometimes the plates come out like that."" Too which I replied, ""But I was able to pick off what looked and felt like food particles...?"" He then replaced the tea cups, again.And the food was mediocre.

So look... I know it is a chain restaurant, but... I am giving them a good review because their food is almost always right on and consistent. Service? Not so much. I will say it is a lot better than the service at The Coffee Shop in Union Square NYC, just sayin'.My all time faves are: Mongolian beef, Northern style ribs, Wonton soup, Hot and sour soup, Honey glazed shrimp, Orange peel chicken, Dumplings AND... recently tried the marinated sea bass that is broiled and for a not so often fish eater (Cooked fish that is) this one really is good.Over all I do not have any real concerns about going to this place, but don't go that often if I don't have to.I must say that for this New Yorker it is REALLY hard to find some good Chineese food.

No one has called me back yet as they claims their dietitian is not there.  We will NEVER go there again and to think I paid all that money for chicken intestines with the veins and all.  Yuck!  I am not making this up as I was raised on a farm where we gutted and cooked our own chickens.

There was only around a 5 minute wait so I thought that was pretty good but when we got sat down it took at least 10-15 minutes for the waiter to actually ask us if we were ready to order our drinks, then another 20 minutes later to order our food. It didn't bother me very much it was fine but then, 40 minutes to actually get our food, the place was almost empty and we ordered 2 dishes so it shouldn't have taken very long. When we got the food it really wasn't all that I got the sweet and sour chicken and the texture of the chicken felt like I was eating rubber. On the side we got rice and it was a bit cold but that was fine,but right when the server actually gave our food I asked for a side of sweet and sour sauce for my rice. He said he would bring it out in one sec, as I watch him bring food in and out for all these people and I have already finished my chicken so I asked our actual waiter. It took her about 20 minutes to get it for more, while I also saw her come out of the kitchen about 10 times.

The egg drop soup was delicious and piping hot, and I finally had the opportunity to try the lettuce wraps I've heard so much about. The lettuce was ridiculously fresh and the filling was perfectly seasoned. I ordered the lunch sized honey chicken rice bowl and it was plenty of food. It tasted delicious, as well.

My personal theory: all of these want to be actors who are making ends meet with a waiter job need to get over themselves and put a bit more effort into knowing how to serve a customer.  Some of it might just be general lack of training.  For example, when you have a table that is anxious to leave and has been waiting for their bill and a table of 5 ready to order DIRECTLY next to each other, you take the split second to hand the ready to leave people their bill before taking the full order of the party of 5.  I will say the manager was nice and besides from the salt issue, food was good.  BUT when did they stop making their pf changs sauce table side?  To me, this has always been a signature WE ARE PF CHANGS thing.  My lettuce wraps came with a pre mixed sauce that was way to spicy for me.  Some of it spilled on the plate before I even had a chance to put it on.  Now I am confident they would have replaced both sauce and dish had I asked, however after such slow service, I was eager to eat.  Being a loyal fan of this chain, I will not give up on you PF CHANGS, but you have officially been warned.",91403

We went on a Monday night, around 8:00, generally a slow time for most restaurants. The hostess told us it would be about 5 minutes, so we sit and wait. And then she calls the couple who came in behind us. Annoying and rude all at the same time.We're finally sat, where we wait for about 5 minutes for a waitress. We ordered all at once because we were starving. Our drinks took at least 10 minutes. Our first of 2 appetizers took about 15 minutes. The second came separately about 20 minutes with apologies from the manager. How it takes 20 minutes to prepare RAW tuna is baffling. Finally, our entrees arrived. I specifically asked the waitress if the Lo Mein came with mushrooms (I HATE mushrooms) and she said it didn't. Lo and behold, it arrives full of mushrooms. Still starving, I send the food back to be remade. Surprisingly, I did get the Lo Mein back fairly quickly, sans mushrooms. I'm only giving this experience two stars for what happened after that. Having had all of these mistakes piled one after the other, the manager generously comped much of our meal and gave us a gift card to come back again.  I can assure you, I will be happy to use that gift card...at a different PF Changs.",91403

I can't figure it out but the fact is we really enjoyed our meal at the ""old"" Sherman Oaks Galleria location.  The ""Dinner for 2 for $40"" ($43-plus with tax) was terrific. The food filled us up and was quite tasty.  Somehow, the Woodland Hills location ruined the lettuce wraps(the slight discoloration of the edge of the lettuce may have biased my perception of the taste) yet at Sherman Oaks the wraps were very good. The service was pretty much by the numbers so nothing to complain nor rave about. But the food was served hot and that is what matters most; especially when at  Woodland Hills we had to send back one dish that was lukewarm.  Also, one trivial note is that we came in without reservations at a busy time and told it would be a 50 minute wait. Sure enough, they sat us at right at the 50 minute mark.

Her smile and personality just made our dining experience SUPERB!!!!!! Richie made sure the room was ready and he kept my flowers and cake (that I dropped off earlier that day) in a cool place until we arrived.  He also came by to see how the 70th birthday celebration was going!  He made sure we had a side table for the flowers, cake and gifts which I had requested but wasn't sure I would get.  So, needless to say the room was perfect.  I could not have asked for anything better!  The food was great this evening... hot and delicious.  We started off with our favorite crab wontons and the chicken lettuce wraps (two of our favorite dishes) and then everyone ordered... from the Magolian Beef, Crispy Honey Shrimp, Sweet and Sour Chicken, Pad Thai Noodles, Vegetable Fried Rice to Wonton Soup... everything that arrived at our table was hot and deeeeelicious!  I could not believe it.So, for me and our guests, we all had a great dining experience and I thank the staff, especially Dea and Richie because I certainly know that when you have a great team it all makes a difference.  And, last night proved it!  Kudos to the P.F.

Immediately we were served lettuce cups on the house. At the end of the meal we all ordered desserts. Nothing came... The clock was ticking before we had to leave for the movies and nothing came. Finally, the manager came and asked if we would like him to get them from the kitchen. In the meantime, the bill had come, and it was 7:40. We said just cancel dessert and take it off the bill.

A lot of things have to come together for a restaurant to be this bad for me. Let's start with service. It was slow. Very slow. Apparently the magic ""positive energy wave"" bracelets a lot of the male servers wear to improve their performance aren't working too well. Also, it would be nice if they could identify the dishes they are serving. The server walked over with our food, which I would say he actually got from China due to the delay, except it was so terrible it couldn't have happened that way, and just started saying ""Kung Pao Chicken""? This dish was not Kung Pao Chicken. Then he looked quizzically at the next plate. ""Kung Pao Chicken?"" Good job dude, got that one right, and only on the second try, with a completely different looking meal. Next dish, ""Tofu?"" Yes it does have that ingredient sir.Then we ate. Bad idea. I ordered pork fried rice. I wanted to order something simple. My dish tasted sour. Actually sour. I'm positive the eggs were bad, as I became ill after eating what little of it I did. I had about 6 bites. My body rejected every single one of them when I returned home.My girlfriend ordered the Ma Po Tofu. Now, they claim to not use MSG. have you ever gotten sick from MSG? You know what it feels like. I have seen her get sick from MSG before, that lethargic, head aching, horrible feeling where you just want to rip out your stomach, but you're too lazy to do anything but feel crappy? Yeah, that was the feeling. I do not believe their claim of not using MSG.

Surprisingly, there was very little wait for a Friday night. There is generally a 30-45 minute wait for dinner on weekends. Two of us were seated right away. The third was about 3-4 miles away on his way to the restaurant. By the time our friend arrived we had still not seen our waiter and had to flag down the manager. At no time did he apologize, explain why we'd been ignored, or offer us a free drink. The manager took our drink orders and then a waitress appeared shortly after with our beverages. Again, no explanation or apology for making us wait close to twenty minutes without being acknowledged. We ordered, ate, and left very quickly. We left a very minimal tip since the service really wasn't ""prompt."" Remember what ""TIP"" stands for? The food is decent enough although nothing great. Do not go there if you are really hungry.

The 13 dollar meal is smaller than the 9 dollar meal which will taste better.   The plates served to us were dirty with dried cake frosting on it that i scraped off.  The music is randomly sequenced music of all types.  The table spacing is average.  When you enter a PF changs and see their menu and service you will ask: ""What is PF Changs?""  Are all these interior designs just a ploy to make up for recipes from Panda Express?  What is with the chinese prints and the walls mixed in with Nirvana Rock from the early 90's and jamaican waiters.  Then you ask yourself, ""Why am I here?"" and ""why should we ever come back?"" and finally the inevitable question ""Why couldn't we have just gone to Panda Express for faster service and cheaper prices!",91403

Upon walking in I observed around 20 people eating and wearing no face masks. The host told me that I was ""required"" to have a mask on until I made it to a table. She also told me that I had to have reservations to eat, I was by myself. At this point I asked to talk to a manager.  I asked the couple behind me if they had reservations, they said no. However, they were promptly seated as soon as the host returned, they had masks on. So this leads me to think that the reservation ""requirement"" was a lie. James Brown, Operating Partner, came to speak with me at my request and also advised me to put a mask on or leave. Here is the problem, I am a severe asthmatic. I would love to wear a mask.... I simply cannot. I have literally been told by my doctor that I am not to wear one and am medically excused. Indeed, California's mask order recognizes that there will be certain medical instances where some people cannot wear face masks. At no time did Mr. Brown ask me if I had a medical issue that would prevent me from complying, I was simply asked to leave. I told Mr. Brown that I would be contacting cooperate. He cavalierly asked if I wanted his card, clearly not concerned. By kicking me out of the restaurant because I cannot comply with the mask requirement, of which I am excused, is insulting, embarrassing and a violation off the American with Disabilities Act. Clearly your staff are not appropriately trained which is why they have no business trying to enforce a law.This is unacceptable and I will not return. P.F. Changs in the Mission Viejo mall is clearly not ADA compliant or willing to accommodate those who can not wear a mask by no fault of their own. These are clearly tough times and we all want to stay safe, but discriminating against those of us who have medical issues that preclude us from wearing a mask is not the way to do it. I encourage you all to eat somewhere else or go to another location. Do not help Mr. Brown hit his performance numbers if he is going to discriminate against people who cannot medically wear a mask.",92691

Our server Jayson walked us to the table, and notified us that Monday specials were on...$5 Margarita and $5 for pot stickers, about half of what they were the rest of the week.  The menu descriptions made it a point that their dim sum is hand made daily.  Most people probably don't know that a lot of dim sum is pre-made and arrives that the restaurant frozen, then merely reheated.  I know this because I have visited suppliers that deliver them to many Chinese restaurants..  Anyway, the margarita was sweet and tangy with just enough of an alcoholic kick to relax me.  The pot stickers were decent though the texture and shape are quite different from what you might be used to. Loved the different sauces. The tea we ordered was $4, probably the most I've seen in a pot of tea. Unlike a lot of wait persons, Jayson had a friendly, relaxed disposition and worked fast as he had a huge area to serve. He checked with us often to make sure all was well.   I ordered two of my favorite entrees - Beef A La Sichuan which is deep fried breaded beef and tossed in a sweet sauce with green onions and carrots. Usually this comes out really spicy but I asked to tone it down, and the chef thankfully did.  No complaints, except the price was $18.  We also ordered the crispy honey shrimp, with is deep fried flour coated shrimp in a honey glaze sauce ($19).  If it sits too long before they bring it out to you, it gets gummy.  Thankfully Jayson brought them out very warm, but it still took about half an hour to get the entrees. We had a small bowl of white and brown rice along with the sauces.When we were done, we finished 2/3 of the servings and I took the rest home.  Total bill was $50 plus tax ($4) and tip ($11).  Jayson packed the leftovers up. Not a cheap lunch but with leftovers, it wasn't bad.  I'd definitely come back again. Clean bathrooms and no crying kids today. A memorable Memorial Day lunch for sure.",92691

Previous experiences here have rarely faired well, so I shouldn't have expected much.I ordered online and picked it up after work. Upon arrival, the meal was ready about 10 min prior to the quoted time, so bonus points for that. This location is inside the Mission Viejo mall, and they only have 1 parking space for take-out orders, so you're pretty much screwed if that spot is taken. We ordered a cup of wonton soup for $3.95, kung pao chicken for $17.50 and long life noodles with crispy prawns for $15.50. Wonton soup - if you enjoy beef broth, you'll like this. That's pretty much what the soup base tasted like. Also, there were only 2 wontons in the entire soup. They may want to consider renaming this soup, ""beef broth soup with 2 wontons"".Kung pao chicken - I ordered it without the chili pods and guess what was included? Luckily it was easy to pick them out. The taste itself (after we took out the major spice) was good, but not great.Long life noodles with crispy prawns - there was a weird sweet taste to this dish which turned me off. The shrimp was overly salty as well, but they were generous with the shrimp.The entire meal came out to $39 and some change, which is WAY overpriced for mediocre food. The guy who handled my take-out order was nice though, so therefore I'm giving 2 stars.",92691

The white rice was that quality of rice you find at your ghetto Chinese walk-in. Where you see that it's garbage color and texture. How did I just spend all this money at PF Changs?

After placing the order, I received several text messages alerting me to the fact that the order could not be processed.

My pet peeve when you ask a server if a certain beer on their beer list is on tap nd he has to look at the bar to see.  Seriously, what do you  5 or ten tap handles. Ain't that hard to remember.  Not sure if they were short staffed or the server just wasn't that bright.   They had a different menu than we had   our last visit removing some of our favorites  like Orange Chicken.  I got the Chicken in Spicy sauce.  Basically   expensive Panda Kitchen type food. Wife got the Black Pepper Shrimp.  Totally different than the old recipie.  Again, generic chinese that is over priced Panda Kitchen.  Also, came with some type of Wasabi sauce dip that was disgusting.  Everyone in our party tried it and it was inedible. Not sure what is going on with this place.  We have been going  to P.F. Chang's for years and one point was our  go to for a nice relaxing,  date night  on those evening when we didn't wish to go more high end. The last few times, in both this location and the Irvine Spectrum, service has been sloppy and food generic.  It seems to be going the way of some of the other formally ""nicer"" chain restaurants.  What more to be said. Strike another O.C. stand by off the list. I won't walk into another P.F's again. So a 2O year customer having been problay 100's of times through that period is signing off.

59,"800 The Shops At Msn Mission Viejo, CA 92691",Steph G.,"San Clemente, CA",8/10/2019,2,"What on earth has happened to PF Chang's? We decided at the last minute to have dinner and it has been years since we've visited a location. I was able to make a reservation online. Once we arrived we were immediately seated. We joked because we were seated at the table next to the kitchen which was loud and boisterous and high traffic. It did not make for a relaxing meal. To keep looking at the excessive dirty glassware at the bar and the water and food that was on the kitchen floor was a distraction. .Our server was nice and attentive. I wish I would've grabbed her name. she had blonde hair pulled off to the side. But as far as the food, it was marginal at best. We ordered five spice ribs, eggrolls, Changs spicy chicken, ginger chicken and broccoli, and Hokkien noodles. I opted to upgrade to the fried rice instead of white or brown rice. The fried rice was so oily it wasn't even edible. Who remembers when the five spice ribs used to come with a side of extra Five spice on the side? Even now they named that appetizer something different. They just lacked the flavor that we were expecting. The pork eggrolls were extremely disappointing. they were excessively greasy and lacked any flavor. There was a pool of oil on the plate and they completely fell apart as we are trying to eat them. We definitely would not order these again. Once the main items were served, we were shocked at how small the portions were. My husband looked at me and said he could not believe that the Changs spicy chicken cost $18. There must've been seven or 8 ounces of chicken on the plate. It lacked the spicy zesty flavor it's famous for. Same with the ginger chicken broccoli. Back in the day it was presented so beautifully it was one of my favorite dishes. How sad the quality and presentation has fallen over the years. The last dish was the curry noodle dish. Both the chicken and shrimp were overcooked and chewy. The noodles were a large globulus mess in the bowl. It was extremely disappointing that we spent $79 before tax for this meal. I would've rather of dined at a local Chinese restaurant then return to P.F. Chang's. I know the history of this restaurant probably most then the average guest, and normally I would let things slide. I just can't believe the poor quality and portion size of the food. Very disappointing.",92691
60,"800 The Shops At Msn Mission Viejo, CA 92691",M K.,"CA, CA",2/13/2020,3,"I think it'd been roughly a year since our previous visit to PF Chang's. Interesting how things have changed, though I don't think the change has been good.--The menu has been reduced, and our favorite menu items have been removed. No more long-life or garlic noodles (we were really surprised by this), no more spicy noodle soup, no more butternut squash dumplings. --This I suppose is a criticism I can level more on corporate decision making, but...the menu appears to be making a transition to Japanese food, or at least some kind of ""Pan-Asian"" theme. I get that this is a nationwide chain, and there are places that will appreciate this inclusive menu. It feels off in southern California though; that's the problem of having a centralized, corporate-planned menu. I know some chains like Chili's have regional variations on their menus, why can't PF Chang's?--The PF Chang's preferred club no longer accepts phone numbers or emails when attempting to accumulate points, you need to give an account number. Is this for a security reason? It's more inconvenient, though maybe there's some kind of security component I don't fully understand?--The table silverware was of noticeably less quality than our previous visit, which was a year or two ago. I used to be impressed with the silverware arrangement at PF Chang's. For a while, the restaurant offered each patron a fork and knife, and had a collection of chopsticks in the center of the table that people could choose or leave (it avoided the awkwardness of waitstaff having to ask if people would want chopsticks or forks). Now, both chopsticks and forks are included. It seems inefficient, and I'm guessing that the back-of-house hates whomever came up with this idea. We noticed one of our forks was dirty, with a big ugly smudge on it, that we could also touch. I'm not sure if this location is under new management from two years ago. It's a lot of small things I noticed, that added up to a bit of a disappointment.",92691

Note that happy hour is only available when sitting at the bar or in the designated are (right side of the dinning area). Make sure you mention to the hostess about HH because she didn't mention it at all when seating us.

It's a great Asian fusion no doubt. I ordered via yelp (technically their site within yelp) it is supposed to be ready by 6:25 according to their email. But it is the day before thanksgiving and there's a line of folks waiting for take out. It was 7:00 when my order was ready. Clearly their estimated time need improvement. Tech improvement suggestion: find a way to interface with the kitchen orders or how busy the restaurant is and change the time accordingly. Then there's the location of the take out. It's at the bar by the bathroom. There's no room for anyone to stand. There's 1 girl doing all the orders, she could use some help. Since it took an hour to complete my order, some of my food were sitting on the counter for quite some time. I got a mix of cold and hot food.

Chang's for years and they have going down hill. I use to order their Chicken Wings. Sometime they were raw or over cooked. They have discontinued chicken wings. I'm not a happy camper with the changes on their Happy Hour menu. We decided to try other items on the Happy Hour menu. First choice was shrimp dumplings. They were cold and mushy - second item was egg rolls.  You get two per order.  Over fried and not very good.  One was chicken and one was pork. The chicken one was ok but the pork one had crumble pieces of pork. It tasted like burger meat. That was unedible!!  Third item was chicken lettuce wraps.  It was cold and the fried noodles on the bottom were stale. . What happened to P.F. CHANGS?  The quality of their food has gone extremely downhill. Most dishes are fried with old oil. Everything is sauced to death making most meals soggy and salty.  I always  ask for sauce on the side or light sauce that's a 50/50 if it comes out the way  I order it with some changes. Again with regards  to their vegetables, I order them well down. That never happens so the manager always gets  involved and talks to the kitchen. I don't think they actually look a the orders that they get.  I've never had a good meal there for quit awhile. The two stars is because of the bartender.  He was a server and then became a bartender. He was off the charts with regards to service. My friend ordered a pear mojito, well balanced alcohol to mix with fresh mint.  What a great guy. I would go back to just have drinks only. I can not recommend P.F. Chang's at all.

This location is almost always packed since it's located at the mall so I try to avoid the lunch or dinner rush periods. However, it's a big restaurant and they've been around for a while so the wait is usually manageable. I would say that the service is far better than the food. The staff is friendly and the servers and management always seem to be conscious of the customer. There are some really good dishes, but my family tends to get the basics like orange chicken or Mongolian beef. I grew up in Hawaii with real Chinese food and have travelled to Hong Kong and Beijing so I always consider this ""white man's"" Chinese.  That's a joke for those politically correct. It's good, but no where near authentic. The prices are towards the high side for what you get, but you're really paying for the atmosphere and that is worth it.",92691

It wasn't very busy and we were seated in a booth right away. I like that they have a separate gluten free menu and a clear knowledge of it. They clearly train their staff to know and they were one of the first restaurants to do the gf menu. We started with the chicken lettuce wraps and they were great. We really enjoyed them. Next we ordered the egg drop soup. We ordered the bowl, which serves 6, because we enjoy it and the cost difference is minimal. The soup was incredibly bland and nothing like we've had before. We mentioned it to the waitress and she took it back. Apparently a crucial ingredient had been forgotten (oyster sauce). They brought us a new bowl, but I'm pretty sure they just added oyster sauce to our old bowl. It still didn't taste good and we ate very little. Our meals were decent but again, something was just off or missing. We didn't finish our meals either. All in all it was a very disappointing experience.

Ask for the Changs for Two meal deal.  You get 2 soups, 1 appetizer, 2 entrees, and a dessert to share.  It is very affordable, for only $45.  You are pretty much guaranteed to have 2 more meals of leftovers to take home too.  I really like the Kung Pao Shrimp, Changs Chicken Lettuce Wraps, Dynamite Shrimp, Mongolian Beef, Crispy Honey Shrimp or chicken, and more.  For dessert, the fried banana with coconut pineapple ice cream is so delicious!  We always have so much food to take home.  You can get white or brown rice with any entree.  The food is always consistent.  Even though this place is a chain, I trust the quality I get here.  Plenty of parking on the back side of the Shops of Mission Viejo, so don't be confused. It is tucked away behind the main mall area.",92691

125,"800 The Shops At Msn Mission Viejo, CA 92691",Jeff K.,"San Clemente, CA",12/22/2017,3,"Decent Prices for Good food.First time to this location and it was a long wait. I do like Asian food but I've never been drawn to P.F. Changs. I actually was always under the assumption that it was expensive. But looking at the bill last night after ordering an appetizer, a soup and two entrees and still being under $50.00 was pretty good.LOCATION & AMBIANCE (Rating 2.75) I have to say it feels like this location needs an update. The flooring is old and dirty and the bar area is oddly located IMO. Being off of a food court is also a bit odd as well but I guess there's an argument to be made that it draws people in being one of the nicest establishments in the food court.SERVICE (Rating 4.25) Honestly the service was better than I've ever experienced at P.F. Chang's previously. The waiter was on top of almost everything even though he had way too many tables to handle IMO.CHICKEN LETTUCE WRAPS (Rating 4.25) These things are good and I'd recommend them to anyone. The lettuce is cold, fresh and the chicken is fried with just the right amount of spice and has a great flavor.EGG DROP SOUP (Rating 3.5) The vegetables were cooked perfectly in the soup but the soup was served not as warm as it should have been. I'm also not a big fan of the brown broth.CHANG's SPICY CHICKEN (Rating 3.5) chicken stir fried with a  sweet spicy chili sauce and green onion. This dish is tasty and I'd order it again even though the presentation is lackluster. I don't usually compare restaurants in reviews but because this called your ""Signature"" dish I think it's fair and I think you need to work harder.  The Cheesecake factory's Spicy Cashew Chicken blows this away in flavor and presentation for about the same price. And that's not their ""Signature"" dish.GINGER CHICKEN with BROCCOLI (Rating 3.5) It's simple as it sounds and doesn't stand out as an amazing dish IMO. It does have a nice garlic / green onion overtone and the broccoli was steamed well.",92691

Couldn't think offhand on what I wanted to replace it, so I asked for a menu. My server disappeared into the kitchen. Mentally made my choice, placed menu back on bar and waited for his return. Upon which, instead of taking my new order, he began helping another take out customer that had arrived after me. After waiting 4 or 5 min for him to get her order and close her out I decided not to add anything. Didn't want the rest of the order getting any colder than it already had. Closed out with a gift card, and left having bit my tongue. Got home to find out that the fried rice that would have come with the discontinued item had been included at my expense.

Unsatisfactory. While cleanliness is good and the food is generally good as well, the service is always slow as well as for how long it takes for the food to come out. Whenever we eat here, some part of our order always goes wrong. For example the soup not coming and us having to remind them about it as a considerable amount of time passes, or they bring out the wrong item for us, etc. It seems they're always hectic in the kitchen and management needs to figure things out at this location as there's always something that goes wrong with our order or simply takes forever.",92691

My wife try to get a word with another server that brought it appetizer, she thought he look familiar but he just said no and left, no opportunity to place an order. Still waiting for my drink! Appetizer are gone and we are still waiting for some one to take out order. Finally the drink came after I ask a third server to check for my drink. Food as delicious as always. While we enjoyed our food we can contemplate the waitress having a nice conversation with the table next to us, that is done with their food and look like a family that frequently visit this place. Is nice to see that they take care of the regulars, but I guess they don't recognize us!!  Needles to say that take forever to get our check, and after asking to a 4th waitress to take care of our bill just to discover that ""your waiter has to take care of this for you"".

Prices have increased since our last visit. For the chicken lettuce wraps, they put the chicken mixture on top of a thick layer of hard rice noodles.

I seem to remember the last time I visited here as being more tasty, but I think the menu has changed. They offer sushi and Pad Thai in addition to Chinese food now. We tried lobster fried rice, orange peel chicken and chicken lo mein. My favorite out of these was the orange peel chicken. It was sweet but not too sweet and with a little bit of a kick towards the end. My husband's favorite was the lobster fried rice. It had pieces of breaded, fried lobster in it and vegetables such as edamame. I liked the noodles for the chicken lo mein but I found the dish to be on the salty side.

They did have a Lobster and Shrimp Fried Rice that tempted my order, but we decided to go with a noodle dish instead. The Pepper Steak was amazing. Tasty with the perfect pepper seasoning. Another nod to the think tank of chefs that create the magic here. We also had the Garlic Noodles, that weren't what I was hoping but perhaps someone else will like them.

Good service and food.The second time which was last week, the service was fine and the food was mediocre. I ordered the Lobster Roll. It was OK; super bland. The server asked how I liked it and I was completely honest that it was fine, just lacking flavor. She asked if I'd like to try the Shrimp tempura roll, I accepted and it was great! She took off the other roll and put the new roll on. That's fine, I wasn't looking for anything for free. Now for today's updated review. We walked in about 6pm. It's a Saturday so yeah, it was pretty busy. We were quoted a 25 minute wait. Not bad! About 20 minutes go by and we are noticing a few people are being seated ahead of us. It was strange but I'm not one to tell the host how to do their job. About 15 more minutes went by (40 total) and the host asked for our name and she apologized for the long wait. I am not sure but I think they forgot about us, but I can't be sure. Anyways, we were seated about 45 minutes after checking in. The food was really good. I had the poke bowl and ginger chicken.

First our waiter said she didn't know anything about it and would have to check and didn't come back for almost 15 minutes. Then her answer was yes we could have the specials but then she walked away again and we waited again before she came back and asked for our drink order! When she finally started to put our order in the other server said ""oh yeah nothing like wine in the morning to cure a hangover""! I'm so over the shitty service here.

175,"800 The Shops At Msn Mission Viejo, CA 92691",Krystal C.,"Long Beach, CA",6/28/2016,1,"Stopped by with a friend this past Sunday for some lunch. She was craving their spicy soup, and I was just hungry. Knowing this place is just glorified Chinese take out I regrettably said ok to going. Just trying to be a good friend! Funny enough, this visit made us both agree that we will never be eating at any of the locations again. - The one star I am giving is for their staff. Everyone there seemed friendly, our waiter tried to connect with us on a personal level which was so refreshing. She was great! - For this place being an ""upscale Chinese restaurant"", the food was terrible. We ordered the Ahi Tartare with Avocado plate ($10 - not worth it, found under the sushi section). The wonton chips had no flavor, were twisted so you couldn't really scoop the ahi with them and they were so thin they would crumble if you tried to. We ended up eating the ahi with a fork. The ahi had no flavor as well, not even a fishy flavor. Extremely disappointed! BJ's Brewery does ahi wayyy better. - My friend ordered the Chang's Spicy Chicken Noodle Soup Bowl, the soup was ok - too many noodles and not enough chicken. - I ordered Chang's Spicy Chicken plate with brown rice. Now.. if this chicken tasted AHH-MAY-ZING then I may have been ok with the price & portion size but.. NO. The chicken is nothing to brag about.. it wasn't even spicy! I've had plenty of  Chinese take out both from franchises and independent establishments and I can honestly say in this instance I'VE HAD BETTER (and for less!). The scallions were visible but the sauce was pretty tasteless. - We both ordered the ""Fiesta Breeze"" unsweetened tea. Tastes like tea. I'm just curious as to why they call it fiesta breeze? I thought we were in a Chinese inspired restaurant? $45 later and we're like WTH was that? glorified overpriced Chinese take out. That's what that was. Should've gone to Panda Express.",92691

One thing that I really like when I come here and I have waited on twice is Rhea. She is very awesome and quick, she doesn't seem to hesitate every time I asked her for something she does it right away and she comes back quick unlike other waiter/waitress I've had before where they seem to take their sweet time.

194,"800 The Shops At Msn Mission Viejo, CA 92691",Laura Q.,"Mission Viejo, CA",6/9/2018,2,"I ordered food through DoorDash on Thursday, June 7. The pictures online at both Yelp and DoorDash always looked so good. Perhaps a bit expensive. But good. And I've eaten at PF Chang's before and had enjoyed the food. So I finally decided to order for a friend and myself. Our order included Mongolian Beef, Pad Thai, egg drop soup, hot and sour soup, Chocolate cake and a mango ice tea. All total the order came to $82+ ($58 for the food, $10 delivery charge and service charge for DoorDash, $10 tip for driver and $4 tax). So, not an inexpensive meal. I ordered their mango iced tea for my friend but was brought regular iced tea without any sweeteners or lemon. I don't drink tea and so didn't ask for lemon or sweeteners, so I'll take the blame on that part but not the wrong tea part. The Mongolian Beef was very, very small. Guess it's hard to tell in the pictures but when you order a main dish and pay $18+ for it, I don't think I'm alone in expecting the serving size to be generous. I'll admit it was really quite good. But this was a dinner portion, not a lunch special. The Chicken Pad Thai was terrible! It was dry and tasted just blah. Not what I was expecting for sure. Especially when it's $18+ ($3 extra for the combo of meats, chicken, shrimp and ???). I love Pad Thai, though if I'd never had it before and was eating it for the first time, I likely would not order it anywhere again. Such a disappointment. The soups...hmmm...where to start? The hot and sour soup is usually another one of my favorites but this soup had a bitter taste that overpowered the hot and the sour. Typically this soup is smooth and everything works together for a delicious soup. But not this. Not that this was really expensive but I kept hoping my next spoonful would taste better and that didn't happen. The Egg Drop soup looks delicious and usually is delicious but this was just bland. Not good. Not horrible. Not anything. My friend who loves soup ate barely a quarter cup before giving up on it. He doesn't like spicy which is why I ordered him the Egg Drop soup. The chocolate cake was an unexpected surprise when I took my first bite and loved it. I'm not a huge fan of chocolate or cake. But I'll admit this is good. Really good. And the serving size is enormous. Enough for probably 4-6. I can't eat a lot at one sitting or I don't feel well. I do find it interesting that the cake serving was so big but the actual meals ordered were so very small. Would I eat at PF Changs again? It likely will never be my first choice but if that's where someone else wished to go, I'd go. I would like to point out that the menu, at least on DoorDash, recently changed. I'm not sure if the changes were just for takeouts or for the entire restaurant but I can say that most everything I'd liked is no longer offered and the recipe changes, in my opinion, were not good changes. Why fix it if it's not broken? Bc it's broken now that you fixed it! Will not be ordering delivery again from this restaurant. There are a lot of other choices that have better food and are not as expensive. A waste of $82+. Feeling disappointed.",92691

Nothing. Called the manager over and he said it would be right out. Mind you, all she had was chow mein and fruit. 5 minutes then 10 minutes passed. At this we were about done eating and then the her plate came. We asked that it be put in a to-go box. Terrible experience. Chow mein and fruit was all she wanted. 40 minutes!Terrible experience.

Even when the guy brought our dinner I had to physically hand him all the dirty dishes as he had no interest in taking them (we had a party of 7).

And I will go wherever they want to go because I love them! I know that they love this place but personally I kind of clench of the idea of going here because...Whenever I go here, we always overeat and order way too much than we need. It's because when I go, I go when I'm hungry, which is bad news bears because I will devour anything that's in front of me. I feel like everything I've had here has been too salty and just way too saucy, from the chicken wraps, to the calamari, Chilean sea bass (spinach is drenched in sodium-based sauce). I think I keep eating it because there might be MSG in it which makes me want to eat more and more of it? Whatever it may be I always feel like crap afterwards, my body swells up from all of the sodium in their meals and I get a slight headache. Also, I feel like the taste of the food is never consistent here either. One time it'll be alright, other times it'll just be down-right salty and blegh. I don't really know how this is considered a ""Chinese"" place because...this is not Chinese food. It's totally Americanized and too mainstream.",92691

Other negative reviews discussed poor service, but our server Jacob was great and very attentive. The chicken lettuce wraps appetizer is still a worthwhile timeless classic, but the joy ended there. Upon reading another review I ordered the Mongolian beef, hold the beef, and substitute shrimp. I only sprinkled a little bit of rice over the shrimp, sauce, and scallions, and it was incredibly salty. My tongue is like a dead snail right now! I thought I was supposed to douse it with rice to dilute it, so I kept adding it, but to no avail. My wife had the Pad Thai, which by contrast was really bland and underwhelming. The chicken pieces looked like they were fried or breaded or something, but it didn't seem worthy of the $15 price tag. The kids meals were only 3.95 including drink, but the plates and serving sizes were pretty small. It's funny because when the kids asked where we going, I told them it was like Panda Express, but nicer. I take it back!

I asked for super hot water to heat it up and make it more palatable.  Then we waited another 40 minutes for the rest.  When we asked about it, the waiter told us they had too many orders for take out. Not really what you wanna hear when you're hangry. We were there for an hour and twenty minutes.  Never going back.  Servers didn't seem to care how long it took.

T.,"San Diego, CA",2/10/2017,1,"I love PF Chang's, BUT this PF Chang's in Mission Viejo doesn't even deserve to carry the name.  Yes, the service was that bad!!!  I had been there quite a few times before and NEVER experienced, what I experienced on this particular visit--which also happened to be my birthday. I thought that meeting up with my parents and step sister at this PF Chang's would be a nice place to have dinner to celebrate my birthday.  Boy was I ever wrong!!!  Firstly, they sat my parents at the entrance of the kitchen where there was ALOT of foot traffic, so I asked politely if we could be moved to another table.  Reasonable request, considering I had made a reservation and told them were celebrating a birthday.  Begrudgingly, we were moved to another table where we met our new waiter.  Well, at the immediate moment, when I saw his face gaping towards the floor with MAJOR ATTITUDE, I should have told my family, ""We're leaving..."" but did I heed my gut?? No! Warning to all: When your gut tells you to leave a restaurant because your waiter has major attitude, leave!We proceeded to sit down and ordered something to drink.  After having ordered our drinks, it took FOR-E-VER to have our food ordered and finally delivered to our table. I am not entirely sure if the waiter had to go to China to get our food, but yes, it took that long. When we were so hungry that we basically chewed our arms off and drank all our drinks, I asked the waiter if he could refresh our drinks and then I also asked him, ""Do you happen to know when we will be getting our food as my family is really hungry."" To that he replied, ""Can't you see that I am busy...??!"" Wow! I have never been spoken to like that by wait staff, but maybe this PF Chang's allows this kind of behavior and rudeness. I said, ""Well, I don't know how busy you are, but we are really hungry and you are our waiter...""  He then proceeded to refill my mother's tea glass (with the wrong tea, of course), and gave my step sister more water with ice, when she had asked for no ice in her water. Yay! We're really on a roll with the bad service. FINALLY, ta dah, our food arrives, the food was okay, but after an extremely long wait like that, it should have been damn good! Needless to say, we were grateful to receive any food at all taking into account the service we had already received. Oh, finally, the desert, well, considering it was my birthday, I was hoping to have a nice desert with my family, but that took also an eternity.  At this point, I could not stand it anymore and I spoke to the Manager (something I have never done at a restaurant) in charge and I expressed my discontent of everything that had occurred.  Unfortunately my daughter had already paid the bill and tipped the guy (something I vehemently disagreed with!!!!).  The manager at PF Chang's comped my dinner, as she felt my birthday had been basically ruined--which it was!!!  Thank you very much waiter from PF Chang's!!! May the same happen to you some day!!So, to end my little story, if you wish to go to PF Chang's at the Mission Viejo Mall to celebrate anything memorable, DON'T!!!  Go somewhere else, anywhere else!  This experience left such a bad taste in my mouth, I know it is terrible to say, but I hope that waiter gets fired!  He was rude and incompetent on every level.  If he dislikes his job so much in being a waiter, maybe he should find another job doing something else.",92691

The staff are friendly and the water glasses are generally kept full. Sometimes my tables have even gotten free sample dishes - this is the only place I can remember where I have ever been given a free sample dish spontaneously during a meal. Normally with 3 people we order a bowl of soup and then 2-3 dishes (depending on how hungry everyone is) and that is more than enough food. The Mongolian Beef with the green onions is my favorite dish by far. It's very good and I love the sauce it comes in. I never share this dish when I order it (evil me!). Pro tip: Even though it's not on the menu, you can order shrimp in the same sauce the Mongolian Beef comes in... No surprise it's called Mongolian Shrimp. It's very good too. One of our servers told us this and I had to try it. Edit: Now that I have rated 15ish restaurants, I am coming back to my previous ratings to change them to better fall in line with my others. I originally gave this a 4-star, but in order to make it fall where it should with my other reviews, I am changing it to be 3.5-Stars.",92691

Ask the server to prepare sauce for them and you can ask for spicy or mild. The spicy chicken is not very spicy. Chicken with breading and Friday, it's good but not the healthiest optionThey have a wide selection of cocktails which are delicious. They also tend to run about eight dollars to $13 per drink which is not bad but it's also not great.Overall, if you're in the mood for Asian American food, this is a good spot to go to you since the food is great, parking can be a little challenging and there could be a weight but, it's worth it compared to the other options in the area",92691

The gluten free menu is our primary source for their entrees.  So why don't I give them 5 stars?  It's their price !  I get pre-paid cards from Costco so I save roughly 20% on the total check, but even still they are a bit overpriced. My advice is to use the Costco cards and get on their mailing list for their frequent specials. Their food is fresh and good, so on that basis they get some praise.  UPDATE: after eating there this week I drop them to one star. First the service was super slow. Second they brought a bowl of soup with no lid only one serving bowl and one spoon. The waiter ran back to the kitchen found a lid washed it himself and brought it out with a huge serving spoon in an odd shaped bowl for me to have soup. We had to ask three times for special sauce. Then they brought out the brown rice we ask for except, it wasn't cooked and it was awful. We complained and the new manager, Amanda had never met before, came over set down at our table (without being invited to sit) said they had made the rice al dente and ask why we didn't want white rice.

Unfortunately, the food quality was significantly worse than at our last visit and to my consistent recollection of good quality. I hold OC restaurant food to a high quality standard, and, PF Chang's is I think a brand that aims(ed?) to be a cut above a strip mall Chinese restaurant. Back in the day I remember going to the Newport Fashion Island location as a sorta gourmet treat with some exciting menu offerings.This location I think basically needs to up its game in the kitchen. We had Moo Goo Gai Pan - not really tasty, a pineapple pork dish - the pork was a bit dry and tough and it didn't taste pineapply, and Mongolian Beef - the beef tasted overly charred and wasn't tender. And then, because the waiter forgot to put in our order, we finally got our chicken Vietnamese Spring Rolls. Supposedly a PF specialty of the house. Boy were they hard to even eat, the worst of all the dishes. Seriously not even as good as I would expect from a chafing dish buffet.Hope this location improves, I just *might* give it one more chance, but with the quality of lots of nearby competition - probably not, why take the risk.P.S. the PF Chang's menu is very weak - that's not this location's fault.

We ordered an appetizer and 2 entrees.  20 minutes later we asked about our appetizer and was told it was coming. 10 minutes after that our entrees came. We asked again about the appetizer and was told they'd have to check on it. Meanwhile, my entree of black pepper chicken had like maybe 15 pieces of chicken. Not what I would call an entree. And no rice. We had to ask for it when it should've been automatically brought out with our food. The appetizer (just lettuce wraps mind you) came out after we finished our entrees. They did say they'd take it off the bill. Bill comes, lettuce wraps were not taken off. So we wait forever for an updated check. Although the wait staff was nice, the aren't well-trained for even the most basic of services. It'll be a loooong time before we go back!",92691

I have had the toughest time finding good Chinese food in/near Ladera Ranch. With that said the wife and I gave PF Changs a shot and were very pleased with our experience. Items tasted:Ahi Crisps- Diced ahi, cucumber, and scallions tossed in a citrus-sesame soy sauce with avocado slices on a flat crispy wonton. I thought the quality of the tuna was good and it tasted nice and fresh. Recommended.Chicken Lettuce Wraps- Wok-seared chicken, mushrooms, green onions, water chestnuts and crispy rice sticks. These were definitely delicious and highly recommended!Egg Drop Soup- I found their version to be one of the best i've had. Highly recommended!Kung Pao Chicken- Chicken breast stir-fried with peanuts, chili peppers and scallions. Anyone who follows me should know by now that kung pao chicken is my favorite chinese-American dish. I am always upset that all of the Chinese restaurants in and around Ladera Ranch have a horrible version, but i LOVED PF Chang's version! Highly recommended!***** (5 Stars)- Amazing, zero flaws, a must go!

Let's get one thing straight. This isn't authentic Chinese food. This is Americanized Chinese food. With that said .................I went ahead and got the Dan Dan Noodles. Tasteful, but I wouldn't call them Dan Dan Noodles only because it didn't have any peanut flavoring to it and there wasn't any kick to the noodles. It was more soy sauce based with a little bit of chili's here and there. The noodles were good, and it was still tasteful nonetheless.

The receipt clearly said 2 eggrolls.I signed the receipt and I didnt want my signed receipt just laying on the counter without it being taken, so I waited. Then the waitress bartender comes back and takes the signed  receipt and says where is the receipt with the order on it and I showed it to her and she snatches it out of my hand aggressively than walks away.I was totally baffled as to why she took the only receipt with evidence of what I ordered on it, I was caught totally off guard. I leave and go back to my place of residence.When I am about to eat I realize I only got 1 eggroll and not 2 like I paid for.I go to look for the receipt and of course I only had the receipt that does not show what you ordered on it. How convenient.I call up and I get the same bartender waitress I dealt with at the restaurant.She rudely answers the phone and I tell her that I only got 1 eggroll, she then says I was only charged for 1 eggroll, which I know was a lie.

What do you expect? It's a francheise. It's run by a large corporation owning another corporation. The food is not fresh. Most dishes are pre-made and they just do a little sizzling in the back in a pan. I only like one thing on the menu: the chicken something spicy chicken but it's never actually spicey. That's another thing they do: stress that the food is ""so"" spicy but seriously, it isn't. (Keep in mind, I eat thai food and mexican food and spicy stuff all the time). The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because I had some good times here with fellow associates.",92691

Just to let us know we had been acknowledged and they were getting to us. However, none of that happened. So we got up and left. When the hostess with long dark hair and glasses who sat us saw we were leaving she asked what happened and I told her that no one ever came to our table.

Our server, Jesse J, came within 2 minutes while we had a chance to go through the menu and make our choices. He apologized for a delay that was, to us, indiscernible. He took our appetizer, entree and wine orders and helpfully answered our questions. When he brought the lettuce wraps he offered to mix the sauce to our liking. He checked on us several times--even though we were the only ones on the patio at that time. When the entrees arrived he helped us arrange the table and offered once again to mix sauces for us. The food quality and presentation were very good. I am a gluten-free vegan and my wife a confirmed carnivore. They had dishes that we each really enjoyed. The timing between courses was perfect.

The server was alright and actually fairly good for how much he worked with us and informed us about some of the proprietary ingredients. It was all downhill from there. EVERYTHING has oyster sauce! Like everything everything. Weirded me out luckily for my mums order since she's vegetarian I happened to mention no fish sauce as sort of disclaimer. But then we found out all the sauces are pre prepared and virtually none have no oyster sauce and are not able to be removed. The waiter being cool talked to the chef and we assumed they made the sauce without the fish sauce. But it was some awful fucking sauce that tasted worse than any of the homemade imitation concoctions I've made that strayed awry even. Since I'm already flowing into the rant I'll finish, the sweet and sour chicken and most orders are made with essentially chicken nuggets that are all fried. At this point I was pleading to go and eat somewhere else nearby. But no my family stuck around and the waiter helped. With good faith he made his suggestion to request chicken breast strips. Which in theory sounded nice but in practice is tasted revolting. My dad loathes rice due to his obscure poverty roots but poor guy wolfed down that whole damn rice bowl. Well I sympathized while we were there but didn't realize his nefarious plot to stick me with the whole disgusting order. Still some remnants lingering in the fridge. And yeah with the oyster sauce  I guess standard fare even for Chinese food (thought mainly Thai culinary practice though right?) And at the end we had a fairly large bill for food nobody at me, except me. Stomach ache for dayssss. Thanks to the waiter though he was totally cool in my book. Some guy with glasses. He said order ""Stock Velvet"" to get real meat stuff. And that's that.  Now PF Changs raised Pei Wei prices too though, at least it didn't taste awful, was customizable and affordable. Idk I'm going to starve to death in South OC. And the blame rests solely of PF Changs. Never forget.",92691

Come on- common sense people. Then we sat there for a while, the table next to us got our food and by the time the waitress noticed it, it was too late. She took the food from their table & to find out she wrote the wrong meal down. So my husband had his meal, but no rice and I had to wait for the correct meal to be cooked. The rice came, my dinner came, but I filled up on the 4 ice teas (which is how long it took to come). After the waitress tried to box up the leftovers, I gave her the 'birthday email' for my app, which made the poor girl feel horrible all of this happened on my birthday.  The bill was paid, a nice tip to her included, and as my husband went to get the car I went to the ladies room.  Where there was no toilet paper!  This was probably the first time the restaurant manager didn't come by to talk....hmmI don't know if I want a birthday redo or just forget it ever happened..",92691

It may not seem like a big deal to some, but imagine eating whatever you want your whole life and suddenly having to restrict everything you eat due to even cross contamination. It's hard, let me tell you. So tonight my parents and I ordered from PF Changs where we have even had issues in the past due to some people not understanding the seriousness of this illness. So, my mom being the brave person that she is, decides to give them a shot once again. We used DoorDash and once we sent in our order she immediately called and got Patty on the phone who is one of the managers. My mom explained the situation to her and Patty, without any questions, said ""absolutely, and I will take care of your order myself."" Just having a manger say that made us so much more comfortable that my mom would actually be able to eat her meal tonight. The order arrived and all over the box it was labeled Gluten Free. We just tried to call back Patty to thank her and we got James, the operations manager, Patty had left for the night.

The waiter was apologetic as well as the manager who offered to compensate some of the bill for the lengthy wait time.

I LOVE Phillips Better Lemon Chicken. All white meat in lemon sauce with brown rice. PF serves white or brown rice with each meal. I also love the Mongolian beef with green onion shoot type things. Every bite is so tasty. Enough said. I am in seventh heaven rubbing my tummy.",92691

I never ate them prior to that time, so it was quite a treat once I tried them!Since these two friends and I no longer work for the same company, it's become a tradition for us to get together once a year at this P.F. Chang's in Mission Viejo. The last time we all were here, we all naturally had the lettuce wraps first. I had a simple lunch, which was the crispy honey chicken bowl. I've also had the barbecued spare ribs, which are VERY tasty. I've also had the Mongolian beef, orange peel beef  and orange peel chicken. For dessert, I've had the banana spring rolls and two of the ""mini"" desserts which come in these shot glasses--specifically, the red velvet cake and triple chocolate mousse.As usual, we were happy with our meal and the service. I'm already looking forward to next year!",92691

The last 2 times I've been there were just plain bad. I only rated one Star because there is no option for ZERO. Six of us met for a holiday dinner last night, with a reservation. We waited over 10 minutes to see a waiter and placed drink orders which took them 15 min to bring. Then I had to flag him down to ask if we could order appetizers, at which time I suggested we order our dinners. We waited and waited and he finally came by to say, ""your dinners are coming soon"". Long story short, we waited an HOUR and forty minutes to get our meals! Then my favorite glazed shrimp with melon balls came with absolutely NO sauce at all. It was completely dry! I had to flag him down to ask for some sauce, and when he came back he said ""they're making some sauce for you"". What? Then another 10 minutes and he brings me a cup of what looked like mayonnaise. I was astounded. At that point I should have asked for a manager, and they should have comped the meal. When he finally brought our checks TWO hours and ten minutes into the meal, we had to wait and wait to pay the bill. I finally took my bill to the hostess and asked to pay so we could leave, and then she had to ""find my waiter"" to get him to process our payment. Worst dining experience we've ever had.",92691

I am not much of a big drinker, but I always get a couple of PF Chang Mai-Tai's when we go there. It doesn't matter which bartender makes them, they are alway actually the same, awesome. I have stopped getting Mai-Tai's at many places because of the massive inconsistency out there. Sometimes it's just fruit punch and sometimes lighter fluid. PF Changs is always right. I loved the Kung Pao Scallops and the Crispy Honey Shrimp. They always make my daughters noodle dish to perfection (she gives them a bunch of special requests).

Craving an Asian Chicken Salad from Nordstrom Cafe, their lunch crowd was far too busy for my schedule and I settled with P. F. Grabbed a seat at the bar on Thur. 1/12/12 at 12:30 pm. And I believe the server was Anita?... (I'll correct this if I am mistaken) Now, I assume that someone who tends to the bar area to have some personality or at least efficiency because anytime I've grabbed a seat at a bar it's not been for atmosphere!! Typically, I am in a rush!... On this occasion, the food is just ok, as I normally find P. F. to be, extremely disappointed in the Asian Chicken Salad (extremely dry and dull in flavor) and in my wordy haste here, sat with the card out to pay our bill for a solid 15 minutes! We would have asked her over sooner, but she wasn't too visibly available. She did tend to us and ask if her salad referral was satisfactory, and I politely said it was alright, thank you. I almost overlooked sharing a review, but the more I think of it, chains like P. F. stand very highly on reputation of great service if not for phenomenal food and pleasant dining experiences, so if anyone ventures here who's on the fence, save your time and money to grab something just as flavorful, if not more so at the Mongolian Cafe in the food court, or the yummy TLT half sandwich and soup combo at Farrell's right next to P.F. I'm sorry, but this chain is a very Americanized Chinese restaurant and I don't know why my colleagues insist they love Chinese when this, or Panda Express is how they interpret Chinese food. ~ My sarcasm is all in good humor and merely to encourage fans of Chinese to venture to something more locally authentic at some point ;)",92691

(My sister and I had taken our brother and other sister there, telling them what a treat they were in for. We were so embarrassed, and I honestly thought we were being punked! We kept looking around for cameras, but it was just the worst dining experience ever! Not only was our waiter rude, but he told us dishes we regularly ordered had never been on the menu, and that the microscopic portions he brought were the normal size. Sadly, our brother said he would never EVER eat there again). Both Jeanine and Candice, who put our Mu Shu Chicken wraps together, were sympathetic and did everything possible to ensure that this meal made up for the last one. They even brought us a fantastic Great Wall of Chocolate (HIGHLY recommend!). Their friendly, upbeat attitudes made our day and more than made up for our prior experience.

Nothing I have ever eaten there was ever any more spectacular than a small drive thru Chinese take out that serves food under heating lamps.

Their fried rice sucks, their orange chicken sucks, their dim sum tastes reheated, their spring rolls are alright, their chow mein sucks, their bbq ribs are ok, their calamari is extremely salty... That pretty much knocks out much of what I like in Chinese cuisine. I haven't tasted anything really all that spectacular here.If you want Chinese food, avoid this place.

The orange peel beef doesnt even have any flavor of oranges. I would much rather eat Panda Express, I think it's better food and fresher than this slop.

Considering the experience I went through, I had much higher expectations from a restaurant of this caliber. There should have been much more follow-up. Sadly, I will never return and I will be certain to put the word out that this restaurant is not worthy of my business or anyone else's.",92691

470,"800 The Shops At Msn Mission Viejo, CA 92691",Lin P.,"Laguna Hills, CA",2/23/2011,2,"First, I want to say I'm normally a big fan of Changs. Great food, good happy hour, good service, etc. However, I recently went there for Valentine's Day when I was happy to note they were still honoring their 2 for $40 deal, even on this popular holiday. Having taken advantage of this deal many times before, I asked for a wonton soup substitution since I detest egg drop soup and am not a fan of the sweet and sour soup. They have always in the past substituted the wonton soup, no problem. Like 10x in the past. On this night, the food server went into a big long dissertation about how they have measured the two offered soups into a double-sized portion for this promotion (I find this hard to believe -- isn't all of the soup in a big vat?), but she would ""ask the manager"" if he could honor our request. The ""manager"" then came out, looking all of about 18 years old and scared as a rabbit. He proceeded to go into a big long dissertation about how they couldn't substitute, how he could lose his job if he did, etc. (Not what we wanted or needed to hear on our Valentine's night.) He said he doesn't know WHO could have granted this substitution in the past (BTW, I have better things to do than fabricate this story) and reiterated that he would literally get fired if he did the substitution. We finally told him to cease speaking, and that we would pay for the substitution ($8). So here's my gripe: First off, Changs doesn't give anything away, and I mean nothing. You're not getting bread, as most restaurants offer. You're not even getting a tiny bowl of edamame (as any Sushi place offers, gratis) unless you pay for it. No crispy noodles with sweet dip, as any Chinese restaurants offer for free. At Changs you pay for it. Seriously, if someone is going to lose their job because they substituted some wonton soup that probably costs them all of 39c, then maybe they should look for another job. Does Changs have these people so scared that they're fearing for their job if they make this big, executive decision to switch out some soup to keep a customer happy? Pretty sad if you ask me. This definitely left a bad taste in my mouth for Changs. I don't think they can ever be accused of empowering their employees.........",92691

For instance, there were 5 of us, but we were always given 4 plates, didn't receive enough silver ware, asked for chopsticks but never received them, etc.. In summary, I will probably not be returning to this location anytime soon. It's readily apparent that the food quality has gone ""TGIFridays"" type corporate.

5,"40762 Winchester Rd Ste 400 Promenade Temecula Temecula, CA 92591",Christina A.,"Canyon Lake, CA",6/27/2021,1,"I had been craving P.F. Chang's for a while..but the closest one to our house was this Temecula location and our last experience a few years ago at this location was beyond awful. Since then I had been going to P.F. changs here and there on layovers for work and when I go to LA but for years we couldn't because we were so grossed out by our last bad experience at the same location..however,  last night we said let's give it a chance because I was craving some of my favorite items and my boyfriend did not want to go. Unfortunately I won so We called and made reservations and walked right in to what was a pretty empty restaurant. Not what you'd think coming out from a pandemic. We got seated in the first booth in front of the bar..a bit loud but that was ok..what was not ok was sitting there for over 15 min before anyone came to our table. Finally Tianna came, nice girl..before looking at the menu we ordered the chicken lettuce wraps and tofu lettuce wraps. Those were brought out with soaked lettuce that had soaked the plates with the appetizer on it with a very very watered down sauce that each equalled two tablespoons. Not at all the sauce that usually comes with the wraps. We had asked her for extra sauce and it was never brought out. We were also waiting to order and didn't see anyone for almost 20 min..wanted straws and we were STILL waiting. Then a refill on his soda and was still waiting. I almost got up to get refills from the bartender. We didn't want to make a scene and waited but I can't tell you how long we waited to finally get a drink. Tianna finally came, we ordered the sesame chicken, sweet and sour chicken and Chang's spicy chicken and asked for extra lettuce and the sauce that was never brought out. The food was brought out a few minutes after the lettuce was brought. Two entrees came out one of which was still raw inside because the meat would not tear apart. Didn't even taste like the Chang's spicy chicken I always order. You couldn't tear the chicken part. The sweet and sour chicken however was cooked but there were tons of inedible onion skin mixed in. We waited again forever for Tianna and kindly expressed our concern about the raw chicken. She apologized and had them make a fresh one. I also asked for more rice and a new plate since the raw pieces were on my rice and plate. Well the entree came out with no rice and no plate and we still did not receive the sesame chicken we ordered. I sat there waiting while my boyfriend was practically finished with his meal while my food got cold so we didn't even bother mentioning the sesame chicken. We figured by the time it comes out we will be done. Tianna was nowhere to be found so we asked a very nice busser for a plate which he brought right away and I just ate my now cold Second Chang's chicken with the cold rice. Tianna brought rice after I was done. She then told me her manager took the Chang chicken off the bill..that's great but after having everything cold and not being able to have dinner WITH my boyfriend, we were still very disappointed. We were never even offered any soy sauce or refills of our water that were sitting at the edge of the table. Also the new Chang chicken that came out was chewy and had a very odd texture..not sure if it was tampered with because it was returned but there were some weird hard pieces that were harder than cartilage. Not at all what I expected and not at all the quality and service we've been getting at other P.F. Chang's. Then when we wanted to order dessert, Tianna said they are closing so we kindly said it's no problem if it's too late..she said it's not so we ordered the fried banana egg roll after dinner which was also cold. The ice cream was fine on it so the banana must have been sitting out till the ice cream was placed on the plate..it was probably the only thing that tasted good even though it was sitting out since it didn't have the crunch when u bit into it. I understand if they were really busy and I get that mistakes happen but considering our terrible experience years ago here when we ordered a bunch of sushi that made us sick which caused us to be reluctant to come back to this location..I mean how can you forget the sesame chicken when we were having a full on convo with Tianna between that and sweet and sour chicken and couldn't decide which one to get because  he also wanted to try the sweet and sour chicken since we already loved the sesame. I realize this is a common issue here and the lack of customers spoke for itself on a Saturday night straight out of lockdown all year practically. Honestly, it's our fault for giving them another chance. We should have known better especially now that I am reading the reviews from others on here. It's a shame because I loved P.F. Chang's. We get that this isn't Mr. Chiws in Beverly Hills and never expect it to be but honestly we'd both rather go to Panda Express sadly. Lol",92591

Bill was absolutely amazing, joking around with the boys making the conversations personable, getting all orders correctly and keeping drinks full at all times. This is the service I expect when I'm spending money at a restaurant. I am so tired of hearing companies blame the pandemic on horrible service and less the mediocre food they are handing out. At the very least the restaurant should be focusing on treating each customer with respect and making that customer want to return. I did contact the manager at that location after the boys returned home and I complimented Bill and his fantastic service he provided on this night. It just gives me hope that there are restaurants out there who strive in providing superior customer service, and to every customer no matter the age.

Especially with this whole Covid 19 shut down orders... you didn't think a lot of people would order take out from you guys on a holiday where restaurants are usually the busiest??? And you offer Mother's Day take out specials.... of course lots of people will order take out from you. You should've put a limit on orders. You should've emailed/texted people that orders would be three hours late from the scheduled time rather than just continuously saying sorry sorry! I could've done errands or slept in those three hours that I waited in the restaurant. Because of your disorganization, instead of limiting people in your restaurant, we were packed like sardines checking in on our orders. What a mess! You kept saying that the computer isn't communicating with the kitchen? I mean, the whole thing was disorganized and should've been planned better with more efficient communication. There's just no excuse, you have all our numbers a we have to give our numbers to place our online orders. This is disappointing bc this restaurant has really good food! But Mother's Day was just an epic disaster for the restaurant. Not good if you want customers to support you during this time! I'll still come back once in a while bc I do love the food but I will never order here on a holiday especially Mother's Day!!!",92591

I did it early in the week after receiving numerous emails advertising the preordering system. Then on Mother's Day my son went to go pick up the order and was told they were 2-3 hours behind. But we pre-ordered?!?!?  There were all these poor people sitting around waiting. All of them had pre-ordered and had to wait hours for their meals. We were not going to wait 3 hours, so I asked about just canceling the order. I was told that a manager would call me on Monday to offer a full reimbursement. I made sure they had my number and I haven't received that call yet. I contacted their corporate office and provided my order number and have yet to hear from them either. I will never pre-order or order online from them again... especially not for a holiday. They over-advertised and then couldn't handle the volume.

They decided to tell everyone that arrived that their food would not be ready for another two hours. No one called no one emailed no one texted to let us know our food was running so far behind.People were yelling people were canceling their orders and as we sat in the car 3 orders came out within an entire HOUR. 3 ORDERS P E R H O U R. They are claiming they're having issues with their computer but GrubHub door dash post mates are all getting their orders immediately as soon as they arrive. It makes absolutely no sense that no one is getting their food except three orders an hour. When I spoke to a Manager she had a very smug and snotty response like she was inconvenienced. This place doesn't deserve to be in business.UPDATE: it's now 8:00pm and they still did not give us our food. I hope they go out of business. They ruined our Mother's Day by being dishonest.

But a little expensive. We ordered the Mongolian beef ($18+): our favorite. The sauce is delicious, & the beef was lean & tender. Cup of wonton soup ($5): tasty & flavorful.salt & pepper shrimp ($20+): crispy & garlicky. Make sure to scoop the garlic up since it didn't stick to the shrimp.and the crispy honey chicken ($15+): wish it were a little crispier, but it had a yummy sauce. Sweet, but balanced with a little tang. I most likely would crave & come back for their Mongolian beef.",92591

We were told they were behind and our order would be 1 to 1-1/2 hours late. Came back after 1 hour and 15 minutes to be told that they did not know when our order would've ready and it would likely take another hour. We cancelled the order but have still not received a refund for the prepayment. This is no way to treat repeat customer. Update: I contacted the manager and she refunded the prepayment. She explained the online ordering system is corporate and allowed an over-ordering situation for Mother's Day and they could not meet the heavy demand. I also received a letter from the Operating Partners apologizing for the incident. I will give them another chance.,92591

The server took the lettuce wrap to the manager and came back and said did the manager talk to you guys and we said no and he said well the a manger said lettuce grows outside so it's normal that bugs would be on them.

At 5 we are texted by the DoorDash delivery lady that PF Chang's is running behind and that they took 150 orders like ours yesterday plus today. They are overwhelmed with orders and did not manage it. The system accepted the order for a 5 pm delivery. The DoorDash lady said it was going to be a 2 hour wait.  After 1 hour said it was going to be 1 1/2 hour. An hour later, received another text from the DoorDash delivery person that she had the order and would be here in 11 minutes and would text when she delivered.  Then 5 minutes later, my son and I received a PF Chang's text that our order was cancelled.  Driver never shows up and is unreachable via their text.

I really hope more people review their food at every location while the quarantine is happening because it is showing which restaurants will continuously serve quality food for the right price.

We were seated within 5 mins of our reservation time2.5 That is sadly all of the pros I haveWanted a nice out with my family. My husband hadn't seen his parents in 10 weeks due to work and so we settled on a restaurant which was a halfway meeting point from our destinations and seemed like it would satisfy the entire family. We arrived early and told there would be a short wait for our table; we were seated within 5 mins of our reservation time, totally acceptable.We were seated at a table squashed in between other tables. We were sardinned so closely to other tables that at one point a server hit my son in the neck with his serving tray as he walked by; I watched my son's head bob forward as the the server didn't even noticed and kept walking by. We then proceeded to wait nearly 17 mins until a server greeted us. At this point we knew our drink, appetizer, and dinner order and we were all getting mighty hungry and anxious to get some food. Drinks arrived and one appetizer. The chicken lettuce wrap; good portions, hot, and enough to allow us all a little bit to enjoy. The second appetizer arrived, it was incorrect. We order crunchy green beans, the spicy arrived, we told the server it was incorrect, but he placed it down on the table regardless. Then our food slowly arrived; four of the six plates. So four of us had to wait until the other two plates were served until we could begin eating because you know politeness and everything; during that wait or perhaps they were served that way, our food quickly grew cold. The server then checked on us. At that point he took away the incorrect appetizer; my son was able to tell them that his meal that was not indicated to be spicy was and that the noodles were chewy and cold. He did take that plate away and not charge us for that or the incorrect appetizer. About 20 mins after our entrees were served the rice was brought out, you know their $3 extra for fried rice side. We had ordered 4 of them. We had basically already finished our meals and were quite full when they finally arrived. That was a $12 waste of money.After my husband was finished with his meal was he finally asked if he would like another beer; he would have been on his third at this point if the server had paid attention but since he was done eating he didn't need another drink. I was however never offered another drink. Our table was also never offered dessert. Which actually worked out of the best. We were done with this restaurant. They were inattentive throughout the meal and lacked basic serving skills and basic customer experience. We truly dislike leaving less then a 25% tip for servers especially as we approach the holidays, but giving 10% felt even generous in this situation. PF Changs we truly expected more from you.",92591

The spicy chicken vegetable soup we ordered was just lukewarm so after asking to have the soup warmed up, it came back really soon slightly warmer but not hot like you would expect.

I am 9 months pregnant and we had already paid and I asked to speak to the Manager for a refund. They put me on hold for an HOUR.

They asked for my email and cell number at time of order but couldn't be bothered to contact me and let me know my order wouldn't be ready.

One dish here can be shared with at least two other people (or more!). I also ordered the lobster sushi and thought it was pretty good. This is a dish I would order again.The main reason why I am not giving this place more stars is because the service was a bit off. I came as a party of 4 and was told we needed to wait if we wanted a booth. I told them that we did not need a booth and would be just fine eating at a table. Once we were seated we noticed how the restaurant was not busy at all and they had a lot of empty tables (and booths!). I don't understand why we were told we needed to wait when there were no many empty spaces. I know that seating is arranged by servers but like previously mentioned, the place was not busy. Another thing is that my friends wanted to order the fried rice with their dish but were told they could not upgrade the white rice to fried rice even if they paid more. They had to place a completely ldifferent order for that. I thought that was a bit odd and we ended up with a large amount of rice.

For a good 2-person meal, I usually order the Chang's Chicken Noodle Soup - an Asian inspired take on the classic chicken noodle soup. Its hot, sour, and spicy! Perfect for a cold day. I'll end the meal with their fried banana spring rolls served with ice cream and fresh fruit. It's the perfect amount of sweetness to end your meal at PF Chang's.

They were also bland. What a letdown.We also ordered the ginger chicken with broccoli, and the broccoli looked fresh and green but was barely cooked. The chicken pieces looked a little browned, as though tossed on the grill to warm up. None of the main dishes were hot. This dish was better as leftovers.My overall impression was that the food wasn't as freshly cooked as I'd remembered, nor as flavorful. I felt I could get about the same quality, or better, out of the PF Chang's selections in the supermarket freezer case.The service was excellent, and the hostess personable.

I didn't know if they had something that would be a better value.  The girl working takeout was really nice and helpful but she didn't really know the pricing because she was new. I ordered three entrées one appetizer and it came out to $92. I went to pick up my order and pay and I was a bit surprised that it was that expensive but I was hungry and willing to pay lol. I'm not super cheap but I do appreciate a good value. Yes they had a meal for six for $72 afterwards I didn't make a big stink about it but I did mention it to the girl that there was a meal for four for $50 and a meal for six for $72 and I was only feeding three people. So anyways I paid the $92 got in my car and took off back home and on the way the phone rang it was the manager Jamie. She said she overheard the situation and tried to catch me and she offered to send me a $25 gift card to make up for the difference .

Had to get some soup on a chilly December night. Had a delicious egg drop soup with some apps to start. With our large group we just got a few plates for all of us to share. The server we had was on point with drinks and did a great job getting the kids food out first to keep him entertained.

113,"40762 Winchester Rd Ste 400 Promenade Temecula Temecula, CA 92591",Kiyoshi C.,"Temecula, CA",2/29/2016,3,"For a chain Chinese food restaurant, I'd say it's slightly above average. I only come here maybe once every 2-3 months (usually at the suggestion of my girlfriend). The quality of the food is probably the same basic Cisco delivered food, prepared in a somewhat American-Chinese fusion style. Things I like: You can get any of the wok fried dished prepared healthier by having it steamed. I've gotten the General Tsao chicken and their orange peel chicken prepared this way. Definitely not as tasty (but I guess that can be expected when you pick to have something steamed rather than fried), but I like that they give you that option. I also like the their Oolong tea (I'm sure it's one you can find at the grocery store) but it's always good. Things I don't like: Their salads are pretty hit and miss, sometimes you get good quality lettuce and veggies, other times it's just meh. Also, at the price of the salad, you'd think you'd get a little more add-ons to go with the spring mix lettuce. They also add too much sauce in general with any of their wok dishes or lo mein plates. You usually have a pool of thick, super rich sauce on the bottom that drowns the bottom layer of whatever food is touching the plate. Overall, the food isn't bad, but if you want to spend $55+ for dinner for two, I'd rather walk over to the Yardhouse and at least have a good beer selection to go with the it.",92591

I had a lunch date with my friend so this is where we decided to go because it wasn't busy at all. No wait, picked a birth we wanted right by the bar, and service was very quick initially. Our waiter was a young man, who somehow managed to forget any refills even though we were the only ones in that section. By the time he came to ask if I wanted a refill I was all done with food and ready to order desert. So now about the food. We decided to start with lettuce wraps, vegetarian for me and chicken for my friend. They looked exactly the same but Mine had tofu I guess. I'm not sure if it had any other vegetables in it, because all I could taste was the tofu. It wasn't particularly tasty or interesting. It was also hard to eat, there was no way the lettuce they presented could be folded to hold the mixture, it was a hard lettuce, so I gave up. I wanted to like it so I did try a couple of forkfuls without any lettuce but it was not pleasing to my palate so I didn't eat it. Rather than being adventurous and trying smth else, I just opted to try desert. Hence, the elevation to 3 star review because those deserts were yummy. The banana spring rolls were smth new for me, but they were delicious paired with the ice cream and caramel sauce. I also tried some of the butterscotch pudding that came in a tiny little desert jar, and it was soooooo good. In conclusion, my future culinary expeditions to P.F.

I paid in full online and included tip. Today, didn't feel like cooking so I ordered edamame, white rice, and crispy honey shrimp. Paid as before and order arrived on time but I got chicken instead of shrimp. Very disappointed. Called the restaurant about the problem and was told it would be corrected but nothing has been done. My email confirmation clearly shows I ordered shrimp and the package I received has printed on it the incorrect item of crispy chicken. Chicken looks different from shrimp so I'm not sure how the error happened, but really disappointed that I paid extra for something I didn't order or want and nothing was done to fix it.",92591

Saw the hostess coming toward the front. She runs up to her and hugs her. (They obviously know each other) She says she is here for lunch. There is another woman waiting outside. They both go outside. They all come in together and are seated inside immediately.  We still haven't even been acknowledged.  She stands there and talks to them for around 10 minutes. Telling them all about her life, classes she's taking, who she's living with and where. Meanwhile another family comes in. Also ignored. Finally, she comes over and wants to put our name on the list.  We tell her it's already there. She asks inside or out. We choose inside. She says there is a 10 minute wait. Ok...why did the woman who busted in ahead of us get seated right away? She said she will let us know when there is a table available. We go outside. It is now 2:47. Still no word on a table.

Just the perfect things to get the taste buds warmed up.Then we had orange chicken, chili garlic green beans and lobster avocado sushi rolls. We went at happy hour so we got a good deal on house made sangria and beer. We both got brown rice, which we do because we like the taste better and it's healthy.I have to say that I was super pleased with the lobster roll. They have a yellow sauce that is perfect and they don't try to drown the sushi in sauce. Just enough to add flavor without covering up the taste of the rice, sesame seeds, lobster and avocado.The orange chicken was as usual the best we have found, and the green beans were a tasty way to get veggies in our meal. Our server was great! We went around 5PM on a Thursday and it was a really good time to go, not crowded yet. The meal (including happy hour beverages) came in around $54 and I'm happy to pay it.

The mongolian beef was very tasty but could have used a little more beef and fewer green onion pieces.Pro:The chicken egg rolls, kung pao chicken and shrimp, orange peel chicken, beef and broccoli were all absolutely amazing. The flavors were rich and full, seasoning and spiciness level just right, and all ingredients tasted absolutely fresh. The broccoli in particular was crunchy and unbelievably delicious. Could not have been happier with these dishes.The only thing to top the food was the great service provided by Katie and Amy (who was in training). They were excellent.

I did order crispy honey chicken with light glaze, and specified that, and the sauce overpowered the entire dish, so whoever cooked it, didn't pay attention to how i wanted it prepared. Also, white rice wasn't fresh steamed, it tasted like it had been made previously and either popped in a microwave to reheat or it sat in the rice cooker for too long. Beef á la Sichuan I ordered also had too much sauce, drenching dishes in sauce can be overbearing, and it takes away from the rest of the flavors of the dish. #DontGetSauceHappy #LightOnThatSaucePlease #CrispUpThemVeggies #CookALittleLonger",92591

(Whatever you do, don't eat at PF Changs in TN.) I will have to say that our crispy green beans and dynamite shrimp were both a little chewy and kind of missed the mark yesterday, but my Oolong Seabass was amazing! Melted in my mouth like butter. I think they just may have set too long under the heat lamp. That being said, this is not typical for this PF Changs. The service was great as always. The manager even checked on my son who insisted on going to the bathroom by himself and failed to return in a timely manner. That speaks volumes to me, that they care about the customers. I have to say that I am surprised to see such low ratings on yelp for this particular restaurant. Then after reading some of those reviews, I noticed that most of those low marks were for very petty things. I am not sure why people don't speak up while at the restaurant to try to get the situation resolved before blasting them on yelp. Managers are generally happy to try to remedy the problem. I am sure this manager would be willing to go the extra mile and make whatever was wrong, right! If not, feel free to blast away!

Lots of shops and movie theater within walking distance. But, if you're just looking to get a bite to eat or a to go order, there is plenty of parking close by to make it easily accessible. Anyway, to the food! First, I ordered the best appetizer on the menu (IMO), the chicken lettuce wraps. They were so full of flavor, per usual! My boyfriend ordered the steamed shrimp dumplings for his appetizer. I don't typically care for shrimp, but OMG! Those might be my new fav. The sauce they come with is also so good!! For dinner, I ordered my go-to, the Orange Peel Chicken... and it was just YUM! My boyfriend ordered the Mongolian Steak for dinner... this was also really good! The steak was cooked perfect, he was happy. We obviously were not able to dine in BUT! The staff was so nice and friendly when I came in to pick it up. They had everything ready when I arrived. I really appreciated the girl who helped me, I think her name was Elaine? Anyway, she took the time to review and double check my order and make sure I saw everything was there before driving all the way home and asked if I needed any extra sauces/soy sauce.

We typically dine the every 2-3 weeks. We made a reservation for 6:15 pm and we arrive at the restaurant approximately 6:10 pm. They informed us to wait a few min so they could clean off a table. After waiting for 10-15 minutes they said lets go to your table. On the way to our table they informed us that our table was dirty and we should go sit back down. Once we returned someone had already taken the seats and we now standing with 2 kids. After about another 15 minutes and several others that were seated who came in behind us I asked one of the ladies at the front counter if they had forgot about us and they were suddenly able to seat us. Our waiter brought me the wrong drink before going on his break and bringing in the B Team to take over for him. Someone else on staff delivered the food to our table which was great as usual. And prior to us being finished eating they brought us the bill and asked if we wanted a box. Sarcasm-""No problem, we didn't want more drinks or dessert"". About that time our waiter came off break and I paid gave him and gave him my rewards card and showed him a reward in my email that was about to expire and informed him I wanted to use the reward for a free entree. He brings back the bill and it's not accurate. He did a 10% off my bill instead of a free entree. I correct him and he goes and gets another bill. He comes back and we still don't have the box they were trying to push on us when they wanted us to leave. I am going to be straight with you P.F. Chang's, if I get this kind of service one more time I will find somewhere else to get my Asian fusion. I am disappointed in you.",92591

We ordered the lettuce wraps to start with. They seemed to be pretty popular, most people they're were ordering them. I got the pepper chicken & he got some beef thing. Both were good.

184,"40762 Winchester Rd Ste 400 Promenade Temecula Temecula, CA 92591",Stephanie B.,"Corona, CA",3/2/2016,2,"Gosh this was pretty bad. I was meeting my parents for dinner and we decided to sit in the bar to enjoy some happy hour prices. We initially weren't ready to order all our drinks but my dad did order a beer. It took probably ten minutes to get even though we were sitting right next to the bar. We ordered the rest of the fountain drinks and had to wait another 10 minutes to get them. Then another 10-15 minutes to order. Not a good way to start off our meal.Luckily the food came out very quickly, but that pretty much the only saving grace. We tried a few appetizers from the Happy Hour menu: the California Roll, the Ahi, and some chicken tacos. All of these were fine but by no means extraordinary- even for happy hour prices. For the main course we had the Orange Chicken, Lo Mein, and Fried Rice. The Orange Chicken was disgusting. It tasted like ketchup and the chicken pieces varied a lot in texture: some were spongy, some were solid like tofu, and others seemed right.  It was gross not knowing what I was going to get with each bite- like a bag of Bernie Botts Every Flavor Beans. The Lo Mein and the Fried Rice were fine (though the Lo Mein wasn't very hot), but not worth the restaurant prices at all.When the server came out and asked how everything was, we hesitated because we didn't want to be rude. My mom pipped up and asked her if the chicken looked right, explaining that it didn't seem like it was orange chicken at all. The server said yes, and pointed out that there were slices of Oranges in it, before walking away. It seemed like she was trying to make us feel dumb instead of sympathizing with an obviously disappointed customer. Overall, I would say skip it if you can. Honestly, Panda Express is a hundred times better and a third of the price, with much quicker service.",92591

We ordered calamari and vegetables. First off, we ordered calamari and vegetables, the only thing remotely close to vegetables where the deep fried spinach leafs. No other vegetables at all. That was very confusing from the start. Obviously the chefs don't care or the menu needs to be re-worded. The calamari was very salty and tasted like seasoned onion rings with rubbery squid inside. Just gross and something else, we noticed there were a lot of deep fried crispy balls of nothing on the plate. No squid in them. Again, confusing. What are we actually paying for? This cost $12. But it felt like $5 street food. Poorly cooked. Poorly thought out. Just hideous. Based on other reviews, I see I'm not alone here. Definitely won't be back.

I love the consistency to food safety at all PF Chang's locations (I have celiac). My food is always tasty, hot and fresh. The restaurant is always clean and the servers are professional. I had a few odd issues with this location.In a Dallas PF Chang's, I was told the sweet chili sauce my husband asked for was gluten free, in case I wanted to have it too. That was great service! But even so, I didn't have any while there. I ordered the fried rice from this Temecula location and asked for the sweet chili sauce. The server brought it and left and I dipped my chicken in and ate away. The chicken was really good and I jokingly asked if if they were sure they brought me the right food. She said they did, but that she didn't think the sweet chili sauce was GF. WHAT???!! She ran back to ask the chef and confirmed with me that it was not. So my dad and I packed up our food and cancelled our movie plans so that I could sit at home and wait for me to get sick. I never did get sick.I went back to this location a few days later (did not ask for the sweet chili sauce). I happened to tell our server about it though, and she went back to check. The chef (?) came out and told me the sweet chili sauce IS GF. Hmm. So that's issue #1. Issue # 2 happened that second visit- the server packed up my barely touched food (it was delicious, but my friend and I were talking too much to eat). I had a massage scheduled just after anyway, and would eat right after. However, I get home and realize my food had been packed without the rice or the lemon sauce! It was just a slab of chicken! I called and spoke with Lauren, a manager, and she told me she would send me a gift card. I don't live near a PF Chang's and she said I could come in a couple days later after 3 for a replacement. However I never did get in as we were busy with wedding plans and now I am back home. I may call and ask for that gift card anyway for my next trip. I still only deducted a star for all of that- I've eaten in four different locations and they have all been solid.

Admittedly, we were a few minutes early for our reservation, but despite our waitress not being on schedule yet, I am sure someone could have brought us drinks. Then when she did come to take our drink order, every one of us were thrown aback at how she wasn't writing it down as she stared off in the distance and didn't get the order right as she repeated it back.  (4/6 of us ordered water with lemon...which came with no lemons).  Our appetizers came out separately. Our soup arrived and was still being served as entrees started trickling to the table. They have reduced the size of each plate but not the price. Nothing was terribly hot. At all. Then my son ordered a pomegranate lemonade, which we later realized came from the bar, but was FULL of ice and no refill is allowed. Also, despite telling them it was my birthday, there was no acknowledgement of that when we ordered two desserts! We went the The Cheesecake Factory the day before Thanksgiving. It was only the second day it was opened and it was amazing!!! We'll stick to that restaurant and never darken the door of P.F. Chang's again.",92591

Why mess up what was working? They were once packed and now not so much, fix your model, go back to the basics and original menu. Had Kung pal scallops every time I went, no mas?

Really? OK, I moved on , asked for an other IPA on tap. Only 3 beers on tap. No bottled IPA or Guinness. As a matter or fact almost no beer on the menu at all. Well, settled with Coors light. Here comes dinner,  family style entrees are extremely small portions for the prices.  Quality  of the food is OK, not the greatest for what you are paying. Overall nice place, great service , but food entrees too pricy and beer selections very limited.  I came for the over all experience. This restaurant lacked a couple key points. Food and Beverage. That's why we came. Almost like a hotel having a horrible bed and shower. That is what I am paying for.  Mediocre for the over priced menu.",92591

She gives a rude look and wipes it down. The girl than seats  us. She rudely says the table is damp. And starts making me feel very uncomfortable and stares me down . My boyfriend than says why are you looking at her like that. He than walks to her and asks her name while she was talking about me to the other girls up front (I still have no idea why) Felt super uncomfortable and left . I love of P.F.

As for my carbs, I highly recommend the DanDan Noodles. Service: The service at the Temecula location is unreal( in a great way)! Matt the manager is next level awesome.

It was a rainy cold Saturday early evening. The lines were growing.  Shockingly enough, the PF Chang crew did not set up the warm lamps outside as usual. They could have taken the pressure off the inside by doing just that. Maybe they did after 7.00pm. Our waitress was pleasant, fast, efficient and knew the menu pretty well. She suggested we stay away from the Orange Peel chicken. That dish as she said was destasteful. She offered family style or individual orders. We instead ordered each their own. We ordered their noodles, spicy pf changs chicken, sweet & sour chicken with brown & white rice. Their chicken & shrimp noodles were delicious and a definite repeat candidate for us next time we visit. Their steamed white rice was a little hard & not as steamed as it should have been, but eatable, nevertheless. Their crafted ginger beer was a perfect toast for the meal. Be warned, it's pricey at $4.00 a pop without a refill, but worth it. Got the recipe and will be making it at home. Finally, the restaurant is set up with candles and less light, I believe an attempt to create some sort of ambience for evening diners. Remember, families come in with kids. Lighting is essential.  I suggest, management set up separate areas with low lighting and others with a little more lighting.  Overall, a decent experience for those looking for a spot to wind down a weekend over a meal in the temecula valley.",92591

We were promptly seated and just a few seconds later our waiter, Matt, appeared. Super nice guy, very professional, very courteous and extremely knowledgeable about the entire menu, both drinks as well as food.Since it was a true date night (sans kids) we decided to pamper ourselves and have drinks. Being pretty clueless about what to have, we asked Matt to be of assistance. Only thing he asked for was what kind of drink we liked and we stated Vodka. He came back with a PFX (I believe that was the name) for my wife and a Moscow Mule for me. W-O-W. Their bartender mixed some awesome drinks! My wife had another of the same, and both times her drink was spot-on with flavor, liquor content, presentation and taste. After my Moscow Mule I had two more drinks (I never caught their names), but every time I thought that the bartender and Matt had served me a great drink they outdid themselves and stepped it up multiple notches with the following drink. Great job and ""chapeau"" to the bartender!For dinner we had California Rolls for starters - absolutely amazing! This was followed by fried rice, stir-fried eggplant and walnut shrimp with lemon as our main course. The food was excellent, bursting with flavor, amazing texture and tremendous taste, sending our tastebuds on a journey of joy and delight!All in all a really great visit. Ask for Matt the next time you come in, he was super fast, very courteous and nice, extremely friendly and really great to talk to.

Ambience: it's really trendy and has a cool ambience. I liked the decorations and lighting. Service: we got there around 3pm so there wasn't much of a crowd. However, there was only one hostess who was on the phone for about 10 mins. A line was starting to form she finally did the smart thing and asked for help. Finally another worker came and started seating customers. For some unknown reason, the worker took forever to seat each party. There were plenty of open tables, it doesn't make sense that the worker would disappear with a party and not reappear for another 7 or so minutes. Where are you taking these people that it should take that long? Anyway, my sister and I were finally seated and already a long story short, SERVICE IS SLOW. And we had multiple waiters as well, which confused me on who to ask for stuff. Slow service is acceptable if they are busy. But literally 80% of the tables were empty. Food: We got the Chang's spicy chicken in the lunch menu and it came with egg drop soup and fried rice (for an extra $1). Oh and they forgot to bring out our egg drop soup and we had to ask for it. The portions for this dish was basically 20% chicken and 80% rice. My sister literally had around 6 little diced pieces of chicken. The taste was alright at best. It wasn't spicy and wasn't all that great. I wouldn't recommend getting it. I got the Shrimp with candied walnut, also from the lunch menu. The portions for my dish was a little larger, they gave me tons of brown rice and a good amount of shrimp. The flavor of the shrimp glaze was tangy and sweet and actually tasted good with the shrimp. What I did not like was that the dish came with balled up honeydew. Combined with the sauce, the honeydew was really gross! It had NO business in that dish. Overall, I liked my dish but it wasn't what I was expecting from PF Chang's. Overall, the food is mediocre and the prices are way too high. I'm not quite sure why this restaurant is as well known as it is. I would probably only go back for the bar and ambience.",92591

The service has been on and off but the food is usually good and since there's no good Chinese food in to macula we're kind of stuck choosing PF Changs. Today we ordered our food sat down and waited. Our food arrived within 10 minutes. We were sitting at a booth and the table next to us had a waitress that was telling her customer how terrible the food was at PF Changs and how it caused cancer and that she had a business that would help with their bodies of cancer. We don't need to hear this kind of talk when we're out eating our food at a restaurant.we requested a manager respond or location to discuss our displeasure at what we had heard. The manager who was a whitemail balding kind of chubby on today's date which was November 18 at 4:10 PM.  We explained to the manager that the waitress actually confronted us because I was videotaping her complete lunatic rave about cancer from our table at her. She confronted us and told us we had no right to videotape her and made us feel like we were doing something illegal when all we were doing was videotaping her bizarre behavior to prove it to the manager.We explain this to the manager but all he did was laugh and smile and say oh will take care of it when our bill came it was for the full price of the meal I explained to the manager that I had a stomachache from the harassment from the waitress but he didn't care I will never go back to PF Changs again and I will let every person I know on social media Facebook Twitter Snapchat everything and tell them never patronize this business again the manager was complete nincompoop he had no customer service skills and did not care. I expect more from a upscale Chinese restaurant. I will be contacting the corporate office and explaining my displeasure at how I was treated not only by the waitress but by the manager who represents PF Changs what a disgrace do not go to this place One of the most horrible dining experiences my wife and I have had in the last five years.,92591

We were seated promptly. Their seats are too low, felt like I was sitting on the floor, pondered asking them for a booster seat :pI ordered vegetable lo mein and my boyfriend had the Mongolian beef. The food was pretty good. They give you an option of chopsticks which are presented to you in a fancy looking box. They are plastic which I like plastic chopsticks but my boyfriend said wood or metal is better because the plastic is slippery. I never really considered that until I tried to grab one of the vegetables from my plate and put it on his, it slipped off onto the table between us XD I still don't really have a preference when it comes to chopsticks though, just thought that was funny.There was a fly buzzing around the place which was pretty annoying and about a few tables away an employee was training another on the menu items which was something I didn't think should be done with customers around.Pretty average place, a little on the pricey side.",92591

Our waitress named Melissa barely paid attention to our table, granted she had a few tables in her section already going, but everyone else seemed to get her full undivided attention while we suffered. A couple was seated behind us after we ordered our food received not only the apps before us but she was talking to them while she was helping us. She did this a few times with other tables as well including leaving in the middle of boxing our food to run someone's card.  The food was spectacular as always but the service was not.",92591

Both of us were very hungry. We were seated in a timely manner, after that it was a huge disappointment. We were seated near the kitchen, which is OK even though business was real slow. First off, we sat there for about 10 minutes without any one taking notice. I thought this was concerning as we saw numerous employees coming and going, or just standing around chatting. When our waiter finally came over, he took our order, then brought our water. After that, we waited another 10 minutes to get our Spring rolls brought out. Another 10 minutes we finally got our Orange Chicken and Fried Rice. The chicken seemed to not only be luke warm, but dry like it had been sitting on the plate in the back the whole time. Because we were starving, we dove right in, hoping that the waiter would come back to see how everything was so we could have the dish replaced. That never happened. Not only did we not see our waiter again, no one else (manager?) came by to check on our experience! Really! I ran out of water and had to start drinking my wife's, since she had ice tea (which ran out also). I'm sorry, but I expected much better service and quality from your restaurant. We won't be back, or recommend this PF Changs to anyone we know. I plan on posting this to Yelp also, as I feel that the $40 I spent was worse than going to a casino and trowing it away there. I noticed that no one reply's to negative Yelp reviews so I guess you don't care about your reputation online. Too bad.",92591

I haven't been to Pf Changs in quite awhile and was bummed they didn't serve lemon scallops anymore. I ordered kung pao chicken and asked them to kick the sodium down a bit if possible. The bartender said she would add the request. After some underwhelming dynamite shrimp for my appetizer the lowish sodium kung pao arrived with brown rice. I requested white rice and was surprised to hear that thy are out of white rice and it could be 15 minutes before they could bring some out. That seemed pretty crazy to me and I still wonder who screwed up and didn't keep a pot of white rice steaming. After about 20 minutes a server comes out and says here is your kung pao. The white rice is still not available for some reason. I show him my kung pao thinking he had made a mistake and he shrugs and aalks off saying it's yours. I find out I have been eating regular kung pao and this is actually the low sodium kung pao. Suffice it to say PF Changs seems to have fallen a notch or two below from where they used to be. Both chicken kung pao's were equally bland. Def bummed as an established anchor restaurant in town should have their stuff together by now. Good thing I had a gift card and they comped the appetizer for my troubles.",92591

After being seated and food ordered, we then waited 35 minutes for our food. Good flavored food as expected from Changs. However, horrible service from our server Alex. She wasn't well versed on the menu at all. She told us it was her first solo day as a server. As a regular consumer of various levels of restaurants, this showing from PF Changs staff was unacceptable! Its the holiday season, nobody wants to cook! Therefore, Hire more staff or cancel days off so the store is adequately staffed to avoid this unreasonable delay in service and sub standard service. Additionally, Alex was chatting it up and talking to customers about personal business while most of her tables were needing service. She dropped off our bill and we waited 20 minutes before I stopped a passing server to close us out. The server that closed us out was by far the kindest and fastest employee I witnessed during our visit. I'll go down the street to Red Ginger next time where the service and food is much better and order to table is under 10 mins. All the above negative experience earned a one star.",92591

Talk about tit-for-tat and no customer satisfaction!also, We ordered the 4-course meal deal, with soup, an appetizer, 2 entrees, and dessert. I'm vegetarian and though they technically can't make trades, she did allow us to trade out a meat dish for a veggie dish.

Definitely got me a little tipsy faster than I would have expected. My biggest complaint... Which is fairly indicative of cleanliness issues..... Is the fruit flies...they are everywhere.

However I'm sick of the menu changes. A couple years back they subtracted the  thinly sliced potatoes from the Chang' Spicy Chicken. I learned to live without it. I understand that sometimes change is good, but the latest menu change and price increase is ridiculous. Almost everything on the menu went up $2, and I honestly think the portion sizes went down. My entree was smaller then ever, it looked like a kids meal from Panda Express. The only positive is the food does have great flavor, but flavor alone won't bring me back.

It was literally begging to be used--so, P.F. Changs, here we come! Solid 2 stars for the food. After scaning the menu for a few minutes, I decided on the Dan Dan Noodles. Which, according to the menu, was: noodles, chopped up chicken and veggies in spicy sauce. When my food came out, it was basically a plate full of noodles. I had to dig around for the little (actually, more like microscopic) chunks of chicken and the veggies were also so scarce I had to ask the waitress if they put any in my dish. Pretty much all I could taste was the noodles and the spicy sauce. Overall, very average dish that was way overpriced ($10.50 for a dish I could have paid $5 at a Panda Express). We also got there before their Happy Hour Drink Specials ended, so I ordered a $2 House Beer (which was some domestic beer--like Bud or something to that like). For the price, I'd drink anything that was alcoholic, so I was happy. Service was a solid 4 stars. Despite the fact we had a 30 minute wait to be seated, we had an overall good service experience. (We thought we were getting there ""early"" at 5pm to beat the dinner rush--boy, were we wrong! This place gets packed fast). Waitress we had was friendly, upbeat and professional. She came to check on us numerous times. Also, the ambiance in this restaurant was fantastic. Great place to have a semi romantic Saturday night dinner. I was impressed in that regard. Overall, just an A-OK time with a solid 3 star experience. Would I come back here to eat though? Probably not. Happy eating!",92591

Honestly, I say it all the time, if you're expecting ""authentic"" chinese cuisine - go to a mom and pop shop in SF or LA. It's like going to Taco Hell and complaining that it doesnt taste like ""that taqueria in Mexico"". Anyhow, went here last night to have a beer and a snack w/ a girlfriend. We shared some of the battered green beans. Delish! Better than that tho, was the fact that the manager (Heather) and the bartender (Justin) were so accommodating to the fact that I have a SEVERE shellfish allergy. They informed me that the kitchen would change the oil and take extra precautions. Now that's service. I know that no restaurant can promise 100% no cross contamination, but I didn't have a reaction and love them for it. I still took some meds when I got home tho. ;)Alll in all, I've loved this place since Nor Cal. Justin is adorable and funny. Heather, very sweet and professional.

They no longer give you a choice of custom sauces for the lettuce wraps and we had to go to another table to get soy sauce because she was nowhere to be seen.  The food was very good but the brown rice was very dry. We received no plates to share the meal and since our waitress was MIA, we asked another server and he looked at us like we were a big inconvenience.  We asked for a go-container and our waitress brought one and then asked us if we wanted our hot food to be put in the same container as our lettuce wraps (????).  We were out of water for 1/2 the meal and asked for a refill......it never came.  They no longer offer their custom desserts for the 2 person meal (in the glasses), now it's a tiny deep fried chocolate taco or a tiny deep fried wonton with cream cheese.

Mr. Hassan is one of those hard to come by employees that are destined to succeed in any of his ventures.Mr. Estrada (Manager) was very friendly and legitimately cared about not only his clients but had a good grasp on all of his employees. Mr. Estrada knew details of even his newest employees as if they had been working together for years. Mr. Estrada maintains a very professional demeanor and attentiveness to clients overall satisfaction without impeding the ability of his staff.

One of us got the filet mignon, when it first came out it was missing the only additions it came with potatoes as well as the rice. The meat itself was tender however the sauce it was cooked in tasted like mushroom which we greatly dislike. This was a big let down as the dish indicated no signs of mushrooms or a mushroom sauce. We also ordered the Mongolian beef, this tasted great however we also had to request the side of rice it came with. In addition to our meals we decided to get 2 sides of fried rice to take home, the rice was a huge let down (Bland, mushy, lacking tecture and taste) and honestly after taking one bite its now in the trash can.

This location is no exception.  I have been to this location twice since I've moved to the area and the food and service was good both times.My favorites are the honey crispy shrimp (battered and fried - slightly sweet from the honey) and the Sichuan scallops (NOT battered/fried - although I would not recommend this one to everyone - kinda tastes like scallops in a Korean ko chu jang sauce).  I also like the chicken lettuce wraps, garlic noodles and green beans.  You can get brown rice, and that's always a nice alternative to white.The price is definitely higher than a food court or corner ""traditional"" American Chinese restaurant and the food is prepared slightly different.  I used to not like PF Chang's the first couple times I went, but then I went pretty often as it was close to work and now I get a craving to go now and then.  It's nice that they have a location in Temecula.",92591

The food is always delicious and we always have had good service. They were even able to modify one of my favorite foods from before I had to start eating gluten free to meet my needs. Not every chef is willing to do that and so I am very grateful. I must say that when coming here as a family I prefer lunch time. It seems so much brighter and inviting.

I ordered a vodka with cranberry and pineapple and she charged me 2 extra dollars for each drink on my bill which read a ""cocktail charge"" I didnt say anything I just paid it but I probably will not be back because I was essentially ripped off. I understand for example at pechanga they charge 25 cents more if you get a drink with a juice in it. Why??? I am not sure. Thats just their policy. So at PF changs you order a drink with pineapple and cranberry and they charge you 2 extra dollars on your bill and call it a ""cocktail charge"" ok here is your two dollars and there goes my business.

Chang's, and at the moment this one does not stack up.  I'm going to cut them some slack, and try them again in a few weeks since they just opened.  They tried bringing our entrees out before the appetizer.  What is up with that?  If they were going to do that, they better serve authentic Chinese food, too. Of course, we sent the entrees back.  The crab wontons needed more crab, we were not expecting them to be filled with cream cheese either.The Almond/Cashew Chicken did not have any almonds or cashews in it but had water chestnuts instead.  Not what we ordered, but we were hungry so we ate it.  It tasted okay anyhow.The double pan fried noodles came out cold and soggy, so we sent it back, my guess is that it was the same one they tried to give us before the appetizer which is a no-no.  They remade it for us fairly quickly and the noodles were crispy and hot but it was way too salty this time.  Their food is pretty salty to begin with but this was inedible so we sent it back and told them to cancel the order all together.  We also ordered the VIP duck which was okay and could have been better if the skin was crispy.  The service was warm but there were many miscues which I hope will get ironed with time.  I needed quarters for the metered parking in front and had to ask 5 times and wait 40 minutes for.  The manager, Gabriel, did come by and comp us for the wontons and chicken without us having to ask, which was nice and will earn them a return visit.  Hopefully, they will be trained up and inline with the other P.F. Chang's I've visited.  Temecula needs it.  One other note, be warned the water in the restroom can be very hot.  There is a tiny hot cold mixer on the right side of the faucet, but I doubt many would have noticed until after they put their hands in the hot water.",92591

I have been to this location twice during lunch and both times the experience was lackluster.Their main problem is service. Lunch should be fast. You are in. You are out. Not here! Drinks take ten minutes. Soups come out after the entrees. The plates take forever to get cleared. Managers aren't monitoring the situation to even be aware of the bad service and timing. The salmon and asparagus also came out charred when we specified medium-rare. That is the kitchen simply being sloppy and not paying attention.

When I wasn't sure about what I wanted, except ""seafood, spicy and with vegetables""  LOL - April recommended the Singapore Street Noodles.  WOW.  GET THIS DISH.  You will not be disappointed.  She said it had a curry sauce, so a little different than what you'd expect.  I wasn't sure how I'd feel about it, but I gave it a try.  Truly, the most delicious dish I've had in ages.  It's VERY spicy, and, oddly, it's not listed with the little ""spicy"" symbol on the menu.  Makes me kind of scared of the items they DO consider spicy!  :)We had the lemon pepper calamari appetizer.  DEE-LISH.  The calamari was very well prepared - not one piece rubbery - and the dipping sauce was excellent.  Hubby had shrimp in lobster sauce - he was in HEAVEN.  Daughter had honey chicken.  GREAT!  We then each had one of the little mini $2.00 ""shot glass"" style desserts, and they were fantastic as well.  Perfect end to the meal.  $58.00 for three people with appetizer, main course AND dessert!  We didn't have cocktails this go around, but, of course, that would have added to the bill considerably.  Great service, delicious food - we'll be back!",92591

We were seated in the booths right next to the bar, no issues there...but apparently there were 2 ladies who came in at about 9.30 and wanted to be served at the bar- on the sidewalk- so they opened the windows! It was freezing in the restaurant and no one did anything even after we complained.The food was good, what we expected - americanised chinese food- which is fine- we were not going there for authentic chinese. But our food got stone cold due to the open windows in a few minutes.

I didn't care. I ended up paying $6 for friend rice that was so hard and tasted stale. It had no flavor to it at all. It was so nasty!!! The orange chicken wasn't breaded and didn't even taste like orange chicken. The spicy chicken wasn't spicy at all. It was more sweet than anything. What's worse is that I have had a Lean Cuisine that literally tasted EXACTLY like Chang's Spicy Chicken. I legitimately thought they bought a ton of Lean Cuisines and that's what they serve as their Spicy Chicken. It was so fucking disgusting. I will never go there again!!

The Food:  Save yourself some money by going to the grocery store and picking up a pack of Top Ramen noodles, and cooking it without the flavor packet.  P.F. Chang's is a prime example corporatized cultural hegemony.  Chinese food should be light, fresh, and and rich with flavor. P.F. Chang's is embellished names and diluted sauce.   I was honestly excited when this place went in, having heard so many great things, alas, I was sorely disappointed twice over.Service:  The staff is friendly, but stupid.  They know nothing of their product, and forget to put in your food order, TWICE!!! Atmosphere:  Take every piece of plastic Feng Shui shit you can find at Pier One or Ross, tape it to the wall, dim down the lights, and post a ridiculous rendition of Qin Shi Huang's horse out front.  Admittedly, the hand painted wall mural is pretty nice.

So I accidentally ruined my rice with the red sauce that I thought was the sweet and sour sauce. I ordered orange chicken for my entree. It was bland. The cheap chinese place near my house is worlds better than an $11 dollar entree of plain orange chicken. I have no idea why people love PF changs so much.

It's pretty dead but when we ordered drinks the server, Britany, said that the bar was backed up. Fine no problem we wait for 25 min for two drinks but since she told us in advance I understood. I was annoyed when the table that got seated after us got their 4 drinks before us but didn't let it get to me. Then my drink order was incorrect. I ask for the correct drink and she brings it out. We order our food and it takes forever...and once again my order is incorrect. When I told her it was wrong I asked for utensils so my toddler could eat, she said she would be right back with my correct order and utensils. She NEVER came back (besides to charge the card and steal from us). I had to get up and ask the take out team for utensils to feed my child. Then I asked a manager for the status of my food order. My family was done eating once my food finally came out and at that point I just wanted to leave. We got boxes and left, we were told my meal would be comped because it took so long but the server made sure I would still pay for it. She added $10 to her tip on my credit card!

I asked table for 2 people, the hostes  went to sit us immediately.  They were going to sit us in a 2'x2'  table when they had many larger tables. I asked for a larger table and they said it would have to be inside. I said ok. They took us inside, and  what table did they offer  us, again a small 2'x2' table.

They said I would have to wait as all other  tables were reserved. I asked to speak with the manager. Again,  note, restaurant  is about 2/3 empty. Many empty tables. After 3 or 4 minutes the manager came out. He basically said the same as the waitress.  All tables were reserved. I had to wait. I asked  how long, he said I don't know,  maybe 1 hour. That was not acceptable, I pointed to him if he could serve  us immediately  in a tiny table, why would I need to wait for a larger table if the restaurant  was 2/3 empty. He said I don't have the servers  to serve you In a larger table. I again pointed out to him  as to why they could serve me in a small table  immediately  but not in a larger table.Obviously  this manager did not want the customers, the hostes were playing games. They took other people after me and sat them in larger table. If you look white , this restaurant is not for you. I may look white but I'm Mexican. People of color were getting larger tables.

Thank you too the Manager for coming out to our table personally and because our Low Mein Noodles we're taken to the wrong table, which made our food arrive at different times, so the manager came out and apologized and took it off the bill and made us some fresh. The staff should be applauded for the customer service and friendliness and extra measure of care they showed us today, thank you and I'm sure will be back again!",90802

It is over one month later, and since my outreach to the restaurant and on Yelp I haven't received a single email, phone call, text message, voicemail, or letter about this. I was promised that I would receive a response, repeatedly. I am not, nor have I ever, been looking for a replacement meal or anything else. From the response of this restaurant, I would say that they1) do not take food allergies, celiac, and the like seriously (meaning this kind of warning is VERY IMPORTANT for those with these conditions),2) have no genuine concern over their customers who bring in these sorts of concerns, and3) just post online and say whatever sounds pretty to mitigate damage to their name.AGAIN, THIS PF CHANG'S IS NOT SAFE FOR THOSE WITH CELIAC AND GLUTEN ALLERGY. I have safely eaten at other PF Chang's restaurants, but I will never again return to this one because I cannot afford to get ill.",90802

That was fine because we were sat in the outdoor patio by the bonfire pit so we had a nice ambience. Ordered a few meals to share and both of us were happy with the portions and taste! Mmmm I love Chinese food so I was super excited to dine here. What I didn't like though was that we had empty glasses sitting on our table after served new glasses and the server didn't pick up any of our empty dishes when we finished when he knew we were waiting for a birthday dessert. Our server forgot to give me a refill on my drink after handing me the bill and never came back after dropping off the dessert. Although we told our server that one of us was allergic to bananas (which is served with the birthday dessert), the server still brought out the banana portion together with the ice cream. That was a no no because what if my friends allergy was really severe and he had a reaction!? Anyways, the server tried to ask the manager if we could substitute for a cheesecake or something but because there was a price difference the manager said no... okay no biggie but the banana should've been on a separate plate don't ya think!? Besides that, we enjoyed our meal & had a good time despite lack of spectacular service.",90802

But that's not even the worst part. She turned around, asked another bartender with an attitude if we can move chairs and just simply told us no. No guest service skills!!

It's really not because it's higher quality because I could tell it's not. The service was fine, we were seated right away and the food arrived quickly and hot. They all tasted good but nothing really stood out. At one point I told my bf that the shrimp with lobster sauce we ordered tasted like something my dad already makes at home and it's like $18.50 for small shrimps. It was our first time ever at PF Chang's and probably our last. It's really something I can cook at home. (Seriously) But at the time, we were very hungry and it felt like it was the best choice out of the other restaurants nearby. Decent food, but nothing to to rave about.

Which is kind of typical of downtown Long Beach...Anyhow, Chinese food is generally known for large portions at decent prices. While the price of P.F. Chang's is a lot more expensive than authentic Chinese restaurants, the food here has not been bad. I have had their fried rice, longevity noodles (which I found out is seasonal), Mongolian beef, various chicken dishes, and shrimp in lobster sauce. Overall, the food is decent if not better than most foods in the Pine Ave area. Service can be so-so. They get really busy, so I can be understanding of that.

After a long awaited anticipation, decided to visit for their patio seating last weekend. Waited an hour. Not a problem and was to be expected. I did not receive a phone call when the table was ready. When I went to check back in the host was rude, extremely condescending, and rolled his eyes when I said I did not receive a phone call. Not the most welcoming or professional way to set the mood for incoming guests.Once sat, waited another 20+ minutes to have our drink order taken. Then another 20+ minutes to even place our food order. The seats were extremely hot, no shade or even a water that hit the table after asking random staff, they looked at us like we were inconveniencing them. Lots of staff that just kept walking right past our table. We saw our server four times within the entire visit... drink, food, boxes, check. Negative vibe and overall ambiance. To top it off when the food arrived it was cold so we gave up and got it to go but to get out of there... Extremely disappointed. We got dressed up and were so excited to experience a safe place to sit outside and celebrate something special. I guess that's what to expect when visiting a chain? Our bill was well over $100 and due to hardships and circumstances, you think a well known place such as P.F. Chang's would be a well oiled machine.",90802

50,"340 S Pine Ave Long Beach, CA 90802",Jennifer M.,"Norwalk, CA",6/28/2020,5,"Due to social distancing and new restaurant regulations, it is better to make a reservation online. However, the walk-in wait times did not some bad at the time. At around 3pm, the wait time that the host told customers for the patio was 30 minutes for patio and 15-20 minutes for inside. Although the restaurant may not seem full, it is due to them limiting the amount of guest in the restaurant and closing seating in between customers. Also, they do clean the area before a new party is seated. Staff also wear a mask at all times. Some staff wear both a mask and a protective shield. I've seen them wear gloves as well. They do strictly reinforce their mask policy when you leave your table to use the restroom or when entering/ exiting the restaurant. When staff see individuals getting up from their seat without a mask, they do kindly remind them to wear their mask. This will protect the customers and staff. It is important to note that a guest are not allowed to walk around the restaurant unless it is to leave, enter, or use the restroom in the restaurant. This is to avoid cross contamination. You are not required to wear a mask while sitting at your table and eating. There was an instance when a family was split due to having a party larger than six. I saw that they had two infants (infants are considered a person). I thought I should mention this in case Family's with infants decide to come to a restaurant and would like to know how party sizes work. Overall, If you visit this location, you do not need to worry about social distancing regulations at this restaurant, since they are taking it very seriously. They were very friendly and made us feel comfortable knowing they were following the regulations. Lastly, the food was delicious!",90802

And that's something because I was asked if I wanted the low sodium option, but told the restaurant to give me the regular experience.  How much more dismal and unseasoned would my food be if I were to instruct the chef to go easy on sodium? What truly killed my vibe was the atrocious service.  Parking was non-existent, so I had to park illegally alongside the curb at the front door of the restaurant; it's a good thing I did so, from the time I placed my order to the time I left the restaurant, it took this restaurant 30 minutes to prepare my food.  There were another dozen or so people waiting to be seated, which made social distancing impossible.  I had to wait alongside the curb, which some skateboarders were using to nail some skateboarding tricks on, so I was forced back into my car.  It took me two trips to the hostess booth before I got my food.  The lot next to the restaurant only gives you a 15 minute leeway before you have to pay for parking.  It's just pathetic how long I had to wait for two dishes and expected some tasty food that would blow me away for the time I had to wait, and I didn't get either....I even gave my leftovers to my dogs and they didn't like my food! What saved PF Chang's from a one-star review was the fact my car wasn't towed/cited and I got away with free parking at the front door.  Thanks, but do better, P.F. Chang's!",90802

There is ample outdoor eating space. I love the Mongolian beef! I call it meat candy! It has the best sauce. For an appetizer, my fave is the pan fried pork dumplings.Of all the chicken dishes it's a tie between orange chicken and honey chicken. They are pretty damn similar. The Orange has more of a kick. While the honey is sweet. Add the veggie lo mein and that is perfect meal. It is my go to Asian restaurant. There are a few reasons they don't have a five. The first is the price! It is really expensive for Asian food. It's steak dinner prices! The second reason is the sauces. There used to be a trio of sauces. I loved the one sauce left alone. Then they got rid of them. Then, I could order the old pot sticker sauce and that was the same one and delicious! Recently, they said they no longer have it. That really sucks! All the other sauces are either spicy or weird. The last reason which was a recent development is that some of the customers were actually playing music out loud on the patio while eating! Super rude and annoying.

We ordered a plate of the Honey Walnut Shrimp and the Chicken Lettuce Wraps. The Shrimp came out lightly battered, golden, and crispy, with a coating of sweet sauce. The crunchy walnuts were mouth watering and then there was these juicy little honey dew melon balls. Yes, I said melon. You wouldn't think that it went together, but let me tell you that it paired perfectly! Oh My Was It Delicious!! I'm definitely ordering it again.

We called right away to avoid this and they told us they had given our table away! We were OF COURSE pissed! Got to the restaurant in less than 5 minutes. They told us we would have to wait again. So we waited an additional hour, while trying to politely check in a few times on our table the hostess ladies were not helpful at all. They kept telling his different reasons we were still waiting, which added to our frustration. I work at a restaurant, I try to understand fully when things like this happen because I work at a restaurant and deal with similar things. But this was just so absolutely ridiculous.

Turns out One entrée would be enough for one person. Garlic noodles were a little sweet which I'm not really a fan of. But all the other food is really good. drinks are nice and strong yay!!

Chang's, they are a chain of inexpensive but higher quality pan-Asian restaurants, typically located in malls or shopping centers. Kinda like a Cheesecake Factory, but Asian. This location in downtown Long Beach is right on the water, so I imagine the ambiance is pleasant, but cannot be certain as we ordered delivery. Our order arrived just 20 minutes after placing it, and was neatly packed into nice re-usable containers. They provided plenty of utensils, fortune cookies, and a variety of condiments and sauces as well.The best dish in our meal was the Chili Garlic Green Beans. The flash fried green beans are tossed with an intensely flavorful sauce of minced Chinese chilies and roasted garlic. Do not skip these. I also enjoyed their Vegetable Fried Rice (ask for no egg if you are vegan), as well as the Lo Mein. Both contained a good variety of vegetables and were flavorful without being overly oily or salty. The Vegetable Spring Rolls were crisp and flavorful. The Buddha's Feast was the only really disappointing dish, consisting only of bland steamed veggies and a few thin slices of smoked tofu. Zero flavor, and a disappointingly small amount of tofu. Regardless, I will definitely order from here again.",90802

He then said because I used a gift card, that was why I probably got charged the fee.  WTH? That makes little sense to me.  And if so, why am I being charged $4 for money put towards a GC?  With the delivery fee, that is $7, BEFORE, I add in gratuity for my order.  With that, I am paying over 30% of the dollar amount that I ordered.  (BTW PFC is using Door Dash as their delivery service.)I get it.  They are struggling.  We all are.  Not cool to price gouge.

Still, PF chang's used to be one of my favorite ""chain"" restaurants, but I definitely will give my money to a locally owned restaurant over this in the future--which is a shame, as I live just down the street in DTLB.  Not even the manager could explain to me what I was being charged on their website.  If you're gonna charge something, or if the state is, be knowledgeable of your business.  Just makes me wonder where else I'm being scammed and don't know it.And all this before I even get or try the food.  Will update after I get the food if my opinion changes any.  But the taste in my mouth is already sour.  And not sweet n' sour. ;)",90802

When we got there, we parked valet, who stamped the time as 5:38pm and we had 7pm tickets at the movie theatres so we figured it'd be more than enough time to eat and get to the movies. We got seated right away which we were thankful for. We asked to sit outside and there was almost no lighting out there and had to eat eat in pretty dark circumstances for the entire night. We decided to order from the prefixe menu for $50 for the both of us for that night. We started by ordering waters and it took about five minutes for the waiter just bring the waters out and even ask us what we wanted to drink. Once he came back we ordered all four parts of the menu, which we chose to order hot and sour soup, one order of Chicken lettuce wraps, my bf got the orange peel chicken, I got the chicken pad Thai and it came with banana egg rolls for dessert. After more than ten minutes We were brought our soups and chicken lettuce wraps from two other waiters that weren't our own server. We then waited another half hour before we received our main entrée plates. Again from another server. I then asked my server for hot sauce for my main entrée, which was a mistake because it took over five minutes just to bring me the hot sauce and when I looked around he was serving other tables instead of quickly giving me hot sauce and then serving his other tables. Overall he checked on us about three times to fill up our water which each time was completely empty and we were waiting a long time to get a refill. Once we finished eating our entrées, the waiter came and asked if we wanted our dessert now and we said yes and I also ordered a coffee. It was now already 7 PM. But we thought maybe he would rush with the desert and we could take it to go and rush to the movie theaters just by the time the previews ended. We were wrong. After waiting another almost 15 to 20 minutes for our dessert, we saw our server pass by us and he realized he forgot to get the dessert for us. So we told him that we just wanted to leave and get our checks. He rushed with the dessert packaged and said the coffee was cold so he took it off our bill since he figured I didn't want cold coffee. He was apologetic but it was a little too late.It was now 7:30 & it was way too late to get to our movie so that was tickets wasted. We got home opened the dessert and couldn't believe how disgusting the dessert looked. We just threw it away. We can definitely say we won't be returning ever again.",90802

Mind you, I had my kid with me, when asked if we can move tables they denied it. Even though they had other available tables vacant. The server was nice enough to move a heater near our table so my kid wouldn't be as cold, and when we scoot the chairs closer the hostess printed out paper  stating ""do not move heaters or tables"" near our table.

However when we got home after a 20 minute drive from this place, I noticed the vegetables in the Buddha's Feast were raw and tasteless. I had to take them out of the container cook, pour my own sauces and add more tofu to it before I can really enjoy them!!! I don't think anyone else's food on this order came out defective like mine. Shoot!! I guess it's time to say goodbye P.F. Chang's and go back to supporting smaller businesses. The nerve trying to feed people raw food and pay a ridiculous amount for it. No thank you!!!",90802

I then asked to speak to someone else. He refused to give anyone else the phone and claimed he was the manager.  He was incredibly rude and condescending the whole conversation.  I am a customer asking for help to determine the type of tofu I want in my meal. I am asking your employee to help me and this is the service I am getting. If this is the management that your business has, then you need to reassess your employees. I ended up getting frustrated and not ordering and hanging up the phone because he would not stop with his condescending behavior.

It wasn't very busy when we stopped in for lunch around 1:30pm on a Sunday, but service was remarkably slow. They got our orders wrong--multiple times. I asked for sweet & sour chicken, but to have the chicken steamed, not fried. The plate that got delivered to me had just a plain pile of steamed chicken and pineapple and veggies. No flavor, no sauce. Nothing. I had to ask for sauce, and they were like, ""oh, uh, okay--sure."" Like they didn't notice from looking at it that it didn't look like Sweet & Sour anything. Someone else in our group wanted to eat healthy and ordered Brussels sprouts and a side of chicken. When it came, it was all so deep fried that it was unrecognizable. Said nothing on the menu about being fried. My food was terrible. The best part of the meal was the fortune cookies at the end, but even those were disappointing--dumb fortunes, AND one side of the fortune was PF Chang's advertising!Sorry PF Chang's, but you need some solid new management in this location.",90802

After making a self promise to never step foot in this well-known to be american-asian  food chain, because I'd rather take my money to an actual real Asian family owned establishment that sticks to cultured & authentic ingredients/recipes. As we were walking the pier of long Beach hunger started taking over while the bare sun rays toasted us we needed somewhere my mom and aunt could grub & cool down ASAP. In the row of restaurants held Hooters, Chili's, a Japanese steak house, outback steak house, or PF CHANGS. My mom wanted Chinese and pfs was our only option...........Interior is incredible! I love the natural lighting from the windows and preset tables ready for guests to arrive. There are Chinese warrior statues that are insta-worthy to admire while waiting for your meal. Lots of eye candy that'll get you saying ""whoaaa"" even the ladies room was unique! HAPPY HOUR 3-6pm(I might be wrong but I know it ends at 6) Crispy Green beans 5/5 My favorite part of my meal! the sauce went well with the tempura and it had a toasty crisp to each bite :) Chicken or pork lettuce wraps 2/5 $6I've def. Had delicious thai larb lettuce wraps and this tasted far from it :( there was too much going on with the dish & over powered by the taste of the shrooms.. Where was the acidity and mint leafs?!!! Super mediocre Honey walnut shrimp $14 3/5One of the better dishes that my sister chose. Shrimps were de-veined and deshelled. The sauce was not overly sweet and was savory. Pork ribs Expensive and flavorless! Don't order this one unless you want to pay over $12 for a couple pieces of baby ribs that literally was rubbed with salt and pepper.... 2/5Combo pad Thai 3/5 Meh, my uncles restaurant does the pad Thai so well that when I bit into PFS padthai I could taste the difference right away. Oily, no tamarind flavor, no sweetness.... I needed fish sauce and thai chili but the waitress said she had NONE of those..which i find shocking asf being an ""Asian"" restaurant those are your must haves to cook ANYTHING!!Service 5/5 Lauren was the sweetest, Thank you for your awesome service and smiles :-) Would I return?

The two girls at the front that met us at the front were extremely unhelpful and rude. We got seated and the table was broken and they both refused to provide us with another table. ( after going back and forth the waitress actually did it for us). After waiting 30 minutes we got our appetizers  and  one was burnt so it was remade for us without us asking. The first alcoholic beverage contained no alcohol. I ordered my pad thai noodles spicy and they did not make them spicy ( didn't eat them) flavorless. The kung pao shrimp was also burnt. Overall this experience was horrible I love P.F. Chang's I understand with the whole COVID situation it's not easy but this was just plain bad. Of course I still tipped the waitress and paid for my food. But it took us at least 3 hours to eat and I believe McDonald's would have been a better alternative. I hope the manager reads this and does something about it . I would love to go back there and have a nice dinner.,90802

They have both been throwing up for two days now. It is sad watching a 3 and 6 year old throw up so bad for this long.I'm am just glad that my grandma didn't eat the wraps because who knows how that would effect a 92 year old. The condition of the men's bathroom was also unacceptable. There was pools of urine all over the floor and wads of toilet paper all over the floors in the stalls. I reported this to a employee who didn't seem to care very much.We definitely will never go back to this location and I will strongly recommend that nobody else goes there as well.

Generally their food is great, the atmosphere is pleasant and the service is good.But this time I was quite disappointed. I visited the establishment with my husband on a weekend away from home.Upon arrival, the hostess informed us that the wait would be 15 or 20 minutes. We had decided on an outdoor table, since indoors was very loud. However, more than 25 minutes passed, and we were still waiting. When my husband inquired inside, it appeared that they had all but forgotten about us. We were then quickly seated, but apparently they had also forgotten that we wanted to sit on the patio, so the hostess first steered us to a table indoors first. After finally being seated, a waitress quickly came, and took our orders for drinks and maincourse. My husband ordered the honey walnut shrimp and I ordered a honey chicken dish.Shortly there after, another waitress appeared and it turned out that there was a disagreement between servers on whose table it was. This was awkward.When the food arrived, it turned out that instead of honey chicken I received fried shrimp.It took a while for that to be corrected. But finally we both had our food.And while the honey walnut shrimp was absolutely delicious my honey chicken was nothing of the sort.In short, it was soggy and flavorless. It wasn't crispy, and the chicken seemed to be kind of a mush. I probably should've stuck with the fried shrimp.The only good thing about my meal was my drink, a coconut Mojito. This was my first time to have this drink and although it deserved a little bit more liquor, it was really very tasty.In conclusion, they are receiving one star for the outdoor seating, one star for the coconut mojito, and one star for the honey walnut shrimp.Service needs an upgrade, and the honey chicken needs to be dumped.",90802

Now, we did eat lunch for about two hours before, someone came over to inform us we have gone over the 90 minutes time constraint. To be very honest, there was very little people waiting there was an open table and when we pay around $100 for two people for lunch to be rushed out the door, I find to be a bit offensive when there was hardly anyone waiting for a table.

We ordered Kung Pao Chicken, Honey Breaded Shrimp, Chicken Chow Mein, and two orders of veggies - asparagus and green beans. YES this was for two people - we had a giftcard, okay!!

So after 10 minutes of not being acknowledged I'm ready to leave but my girlfriend doesn't want to. So we finally get approached by our server. We are ordering and I specifically say no peanuts and no celery. The server was not sure if the plate included celery or not. So I just said ""can you please make sure it's not there."" Then my girlfriend orders her entree without onions. The food came out with all the ingredients we asked to be removed. We don't have allergies so we decided not to send it back. Our server was nice, was really apologetic and sincere about it. Kudos to her in that aspect. Working in the industry I think it's all about how you recover from the mistakes.

We unfortunately were't able to get our qr scanners to work, so even though we had already viewed the menu online we couldn't see the prices to help make our final decision. The next staff to come near enough for us to ask was the hostess who seated us, who tried to ignore us entirely ...possibly assuming we would make a fuss about the wait time (we did not), but when we did ask her our question she had no help to offer and ultimately told us to wait for our server...which, at that point, we were tired of waiting.

It is really just okay fare and not worth it for the price. We ordered the Hokkien Street Noodles and Beef a la Sichuan. Hokkien noodles- surprisingly tart (which I didn't mind but was just unexpected) and a bit bland. Needed more salt. The noodles tasted undercooked. Almost al dente, which is what you want from pasta, not Asian noodles. Also there were really long slices of green onion which made it unappetizing to eat. My Asian grandma would be rolling in her grave if she saw me trying to serve that. I should also note that my husband is a chef and he outright laughed at the length of the green onions. I did enjoy the hint of curry seasoning though. It was the better of the two.Beef a la Sichuan- was the beef supposed to be battered and fried? It was unexpected but not a bad texture. The menu boasted a fiery pepper sauce but it was more sugary than anything else. For the price they didn't give very much beef. It was mostly vegetables and cheap ones at that- just celery and carrots! Call me elitist or whatever but I think I deserve better veggies for a $16 dish. Side note: I don't think celery belongs in any stir fry. The taste and smell is too overpowering, and they put A LOT. There was more of the long strips of green onion which I already talked about. Overall just a meh experience. TBH I've had better at Panda Express. I wouldn't go back unless someone gave me a gift card or something.",90802

Not even sanitized ! Thank god  I brought Lysol wipes and sanitizer with me like I always do in my purse. Then our waiter had his mask semi off and on as he walked around which was not appropriate.

After using some soy sauce and thinking that the rice didn't taste very good, I checked the expiration date on the soy sauce. The expiration date on the soy sauce was dated 2003! This must've been a mistake, so I called the restaurant. I spoke to the manager, Arelia, who didn't believe me at first. Placed me on hold to check it, and did in fact find that their supply was 16 years old. She said this was Surprising since they receive a supply from the vendor every two weeks. She said that she would credit back my Uber eats fee, the least she could do. I have still yet to see that. She also stated that she would report this to the corporate offices, but I have yet to hear from them as well. Always check expiration dates, if they have that crap laying around, what other stuff do they have laying around in their restaurant. Yuck!",90802

We ended up ordering the crispy honey shrimp and the mandarin crunchy salad with chicken it was just right splitting this for two people. Overall a nice clean restaurant staff is nice and helpful. Good amount to choose from great to share with each other just buy a dish and share among each other works out great and then when it comes to the bill it's easy to work out.,90802

First off our chicken egg rolls were so greasy I had to squeeze it out with two napkins. My drink was over flowed and split so bad they should have made another. She forgot to put in order for lettuce wraps. She never checked on us one until it was time to drop off the check. I told her yes it was ok but it's the end now. I'm good on PF Changs.

We had a group of 6 + were seated right away. It wasn't crowded at all - at least not during this time. I forgot our waitress's name but she was very sweet and accommodating. We ordered quite a lot because we didn't want to share, haha. I got the combo fried rice, and shared a sweet + sour chicken with my boyfriend (who also got the combo fried rice). It was delicious. I asked for some sweet + sour sauce and it made my fried rice taste even better! Try it next time.For dessert, we got the vietnamese lava cake. It was okay, a bit bland for my liking. Could've been a little bit more sweet - which surprises me because places usually make them TOO sweet.

Chang's shares the valet service with other restaurants in a tight circle at Pine Avenue Pier.  You can get a validation, which takes a couple bucks off the $10 price tag.There is an extensive waterfront walking area adjacent to the restaurant - perfect for a stroll after your meal to walk off some of the food.",90802

We sat at the bar, drank some beer, ordered food to go, and waited an hour to get our food. The bartender was cool and it was Christmas Eve, so I left a nice $15 tip with a $50 tab. We ordered honey crisp chicken and Kung Pao shrimp with white rice, and cheesecake. We get back to the room, our rice was a small order of brown rice, the food looked like leftovers from Panda Express and the cheesecake wasn't fresh. For the amount of time we sat waiting, and the high bill I feel like we were ripped off. Typically, we'd sit and eat at the restaurant but after hiking so many miles all we wanted to do was eat good food and relax. I'm happy they were open for Christmas Eve but bummed that we wasted so much money for so little and the wrong order. I give one star for the bartender.",90802

Now the portions are half of what they used to be and the price is more than double.I will be staying away. I sure miss the old days.

A patron did pass me a menu so thanks, but what's a menu with no service? Waited another 15 minutes and got up and left. Same bartender asked ""you're leaving?"" To which, I said ""yeah, to which she said ""bye"", lol.  Hey if you don't care, neither do I. Didn't know playing hard to get was a strategy for bartenders. Won't go back.

During this last dining experience, Eddie was our server, and he is absolutely awesome! He met our every need and request. He is polite and friendly! So this review is not about his service, because I would give him 5 stars. This review is about the food, which is pretty important to those visiting this establishment. The dynamite shrimp appetizer tasted great, but it is a much smaller portion than we remember, I believe we counted 7 small ... and I mean SMALL shrimps laying on a bed of cabbage and those weird rice noodles. Funny thing is, our waiter agreed the portion seemed small. Ok, now for the infamous Chicken Lettuce Wraps ... they really should change the name to Water Chestnut Wraps! I get it, the water chestnuts are supposed to be a filler but it becomes an issue when that is all you taste and see in the dish! Now for the finale, dessert, the part of a meal I especially look forward too. With the 2 for $49 deal, it comes with a sad fried banana egg roll, yes just one, and cut in half. The portion was okay for us, because he doesn't eat sweets, but after the first bite, I realize this banana is pretty dark on the inside. Then I bite the other one, and the inside of the banana is black! Why?! The coconut ice cream was good though. This used to be my boyfriend's FAVORITE place to dine. We used to come to P.F. Chang's for their gourmet, distinct flavored dishes, but unfortunately we much rather spend that kind of money elsewhere. Like many other well know chains, sadly P.F.

I wouldn't have cared AT ALL about the price if the portions were even remotely like other locations. They don't need to have 'to go' boxes because you won't have anything to take with you!

Also the harbor is right outside so if you have to wait its a nice waiting area to be in and enjoy the ocean breeze.Service with a smile and very attentive waitress. Walked in around 4:30pm on a Wed. It was pretty calm with zero wait. The food came out quick and perfect. Honey Shrimp was great as usual with No issues. My youngest loves this dish so she always end up hogging it until she gets full then I end up with the slim pickings. Kids Chicken fried things was just ok. A little dry and no rice on the side but that's ok. Poke bowl came deconstructed so that was a little bit annoying having to mix it and add sauce. But I understand the appeal to those who want to regulate the amount of sauce or extras in it. Comes with some poofy crisps that play well with it. Lemonade drink was good. Extra sour today. So not sure but it was good. Kids loved it. 45$ later and we are happy. Thank you guys for the very first ever painless and great experiance I have ever had at a PF changs in a decade.

We also ordered a Kung Pao dragon roll & a fried calamari appetizer. The food took over ever to come out luckily we ordered an appetizer. Most of our party was getting impatient waiting for our dinner.  We only had one waiter for the whole party. He was a good waiter but he definitely needed assistance. The fried calamari was kinda of cold and it tasted ok. The sushi roll tasted good. I definitely recommend it. The surf & turf was delicious. The filet-mignon was so tender and the lobster was also delicious. Our waiter kept our drinks filled.

We were wrong. The two seats were free because the staff at the time on the right hand side next to the host stand did not clean up or pick up the dirty cups. We sat down and moved everything closer and piled it together for it to be picked up. The counter was sticky and full of food crumbs. We waited and waited but no menus, no clean up and not even a greeting. The bartender was with a couple at the end of the bar chatting it up about places to eat, and shows they saw. She was also packing up their left over foods, but was not time efficient. More than 10 minutes had passed before the bartender actually gave us a menu and drink menu. (Still no clean up). She then continue to walk back to the couple and then to a couple who sat down after us. We didn't get good service until a young gentlemen saw we were being ignored and came up to us and helped us. We placed our order and even longer story short. WE ordered BEFORE the couple next to us, and got our food after them. Our Veggie Lo Mein suffered because it is. It was lukewarm or cool! not even warm or hot.FOODLettuce WrapsThe lettuce tasted old, and had that bad lettuce flavor you get when you leave it in the fridge too long and it develops an aftertaste in your mouth. The meat was okay, but cooked in a heavy oily sauce that did not give it justice. (I took cheesecake factory's lettuce wraps for granted)Crispy Honey ChickenThe honey chicken was a version of orange chicken. The sauce was tangy and sweet which made the chicken have good flavor. The texture was nice, and the tenderness was there. It was an OK plate.Signature veggie Lo mienDefinitely got the noodles cool/lukewarm. They were not hot, and the vegetables also suffered. The flavor was Meh. The noodles were okay.Banana rolls dessertFried banana next to ice cream and strawberries with honey. Nothing Special. Last time they offered a better dessert, but maybe it got too pricey to included it in the dinner for two deal.

Had a double dinner date with sister and her bf on a Saturday night.We made a reservation this time, figured the wait would be long, got there a bit earlier, they still seated us at a comfy booth right away. Brought our own reserved red, cork fee was $15. The four of us are all very familiar with the menu, we just love this beautiful Chinese / Asian fusion restaurant, in fact, sister's white bf only knows this ""Chinese"" restaurant. Starters:Shrimp dumplings: they were fantastic! Loved the hot sauce on the bottom! Wonton soup: we had this last time, I really liked the light flavor, the shrimps in it were so tender. Entrees:Mongolian beef, with green onions: although I couldn't taste it, they said the beef was very tender and flavorful, they looked that way to me too! Hot fish: this has to be one of my favorite dishes here, so spicy and salty, the fish was very tender, loved it! Kungpao shrimp and chicken: we orderd half and half so I could have the shrimps, I think I liked the scallops better, but the flavors were still amazingly delicious! DanDan noodles, with chicken: my sister's favorite, she pretty much had all the noodles to herself, I had a bite of the noodles, good texture and so yummy. They said the chicken was too salty, but I wouldn't know. Side of Steam rice: everybody loved the rice with our food! Dessert Tiramisu: it was OK, nothing special. The food was so delicious, very flavorful or salty, we finished almost everything, just enough food for the four of us, so comforting! I had a seasonal cocktail ""spicy Paloma"" again, this one wasn't as good as the one I tried at another location, no idea know why, but it was still spicy enough.

I then noticed that this ""crew"" that is preparing certain food items are not wearing any gloves no hair nets! But I thought I'll address it once it's time to leave. After my entree came out, I ate...paid for my meals and left. Once in my car I realized, I didn't mention anything to them.

It's not based on their food it's based on their staff. The host had the worst attitude, you could swear she worked in a over crowded ER Hospital but  instead shes only accepting names for customers to be seated. I am huge on customer service and she has no professionalism about her. She's rude says remarks under her breath, talks to other staff members rude as hell I wish I would have gotten her name but I can definitely describe her if need be. I might just go back just to get her name and report her!",90802
174,"340 S Pine Ave Long Beach, CA 90802",Jo S.,"North Hollywood, CA",8/27/2016,4,"My favorite PF Chang's location! Why? Because it has a nice outdoor area that faces the water, very calm and relaxing, away from it all.I'm not saying they serve the most authentic Chinese food. I'm not thrilled they raised their prices lately and their portions are getting smaller and smaller.But I like their Happy Hour deals (3 pm-6 pm M-F) and I'm a huge fan of their Mai Tais- they're big and strong. I also like their PF Chang's for Two deal (prix fixe menu with decent choices)  if you have more appetite that day- for $43- you get a cup of soup, appetizer, an entree each and split a dessert. I've tried many of their dishes. My favorite one  is their Crispy Honey Shrimp- sweet and delicious. But I enjoy their Orange Chicken, their Sweet and Sour Chicken, Kung-Pao, their Mongolian beef, Pork Lo Mein. Their chicken lettuce are a classic, crab wontons and dumplings are tasty and fun, our favorite appetizer here is the salt and pepper calamari.The hot and sour soup is decent.Their desserts are just OK, the Great Wall of Chocolate is good, but huge, so save it for a special occasion.So,if you visit downtown Long Beach, the Aquarium, this is a decent choice among the sea of chain restaurants in the area. There are various parking options, none free.Decent service. Great patio, perfect place to relax at the end of the day while sipping a Mai Tai and admiring a cute ocean view.",90802

I came for lunch and they served me a joke. I ordered a salmon and it was literally the size of 2 chicken nuggets. I also ordered some dumpling and although they were cooked well they were lacking in flavor. This is the first time I write a review, I did it cause I'm appalled at this place. The first time I've ever  experienced losing my appetite at the sight of food was here. Don't throw away your money it's a joke. Plus this place is extremely dark and hard to get into park. Just don't come. Paid $35 for crap lunch",90802

While discussing this with Grubhub, they said they contacted this restaurant and they advised pricing is higher because they're using a 3rd party system (Yelp) that charges fees. Grubhub driver said Pf chang's forgot to include our desserts so the driver had to go back and I requested our food be warm because we've spent over $120.Food was delivered 1/2 later than promised and our food was cold.Wasted an hour on chat with grubhub.  Pf Chang's excuse for price difference is a shame.  You have small family owned businesses that are honest with their pricing while this big chain sneaks in price differentials.",90802

Would you serve someone a Margarita without the tequilla? A Rose's Lemonade without the lemonade? I should have been notified the ingredient was out when I ordered the drink. I would've ordered something else. He was VERY unprofessional and did not offer to make me something else, comp or even give a discount. If I'm paying for a full drink, I expect the full drink.

Good for us, not so much for them... Anyway we were seated promptly and given menus. We ended up ordering the crab stuff wontons as an appetizer. They came out hot and crispy with just enough filling I would order this again if I were to come back. For Main Entrees we ordered the honey shrimp which was ehhhh nothing special. For a price of $16 I expected way way more from this dish.  We also ordered the Kung pao chicken which was pretty tasty but in my opinion barely had any chicken... Again for $16 a plate can I at least get somewhat full dang! All I all this place is just overpriced and Americanized real Chinese food is not like this.

It was the smallest scoop of ahi tuna. With a few items around the ahi tuna.

In the San Gabriel Valley there are tons of other restaurants that do this type of food for half the price. With better ingredients and better flavor. The server that helped us was an Asian man of medium stature with tattoos on his arm, amazing service. The reason we did not give this place four or five stars is because it was super dirty outside tables were dirty floor was dirty trash everywhere the table was sticky, there was a tray with dirty dishes. It was empty as well so I know the staff had time to clean up.We might go back but probably for happy hour and maybe not that location.",90802

Much to our delight, we were able to take advantage of their AWESOME 3-6 Happy Hour drink and food specials. We had three appetizers (tempura cauliflower, crab wontons, and of course the lettuce wraps) all of which were just $5 a piece. Along with some delicious $6 drinks (their Moscow Mule and Sangria, I highly reccomend the mule) For a chain, they really delivered.

My go-to is typically the garlic noodles, you really can't go wrong. It doesn't say it on the menu but you can add meat/tofu to it *for a charge*.Second go-to is the crispy green bean appetizer. It's just green beans that have been battered and deep fried but the dipping sauce they serve with it is magical, it's some sort of queso/chipotle/mayo concoction that I would probably dip anything in.Today was my first time trying their new street tacos (Kung pao chicken). *sorry it was poor lighting for pics*. The tacos are surprisingly refreshing because the shell is made of jicama - who knew!?Also hiiiighly recommend the sweet vanilla wonton dessert.",90802

My friend and I decided to take a road trip to Shoreline Village in Long Beach because our favorite restaurant is there, pfchangs! The waitresses the greeter the host everybody is always super super friendly to us.My favorite thing to do when I go out to eat is to sit outside so that I can watch The View while I eat. PF Changs is right by the water and it's just a beautiful place to eat of course though, you come for the food. This place by far is the best Chinese food I have ever eaten. The spring rolls are so decadent, and you have to try the broccoli and beef. Most places will have this dish but the meat is so rubbery you could tell that they use a low grade of meat. Not pfchangs, they serve teriyaki beef that is so succulent and the broccoli is cooked just right never over-cooked it so firm but has a crisp to it. Like I said if you want great Chinese food you have to go to PF Changs in Long Beach by Shoreline Village",90802

The manager and chef must have been off too!!!Upon entering, they have 2 hostesses gossiping at the front-- one at the host stand, and the other actually sitting down on the bench/booth across from it. Guests are coming and leaving, and they failed to greet or acknowledge even a single guest who passed by them.Our server was inattentive, and lacked basic serving and social skills. She did not start off with a greeting or even her name at the very least. She did not check in on us when we initially received our dishes. We had to wait til she passed by us, to grab her attention. Maybe she was swamped, but she was slipping on refills and pre-bussing as well. The food was over-seasoned to the point where it was inedible. The Mongolian beef was so salty, it killed my taste buds-- four glasses of water later, and my mouth is still numb. I ended up sending it back. The Honey Walnut Shrimp was too sweet and overdressed. By the time it got to my table, it was completely soggy. I sent this dish back too. The Pad Thai was drenched in what tasted like Oyster Sauce. It was too tangy. It was too salty. It was too sweet. I sent this dish back as well. The fried rice was oily and undercooked. There were still hard grains of rice throughout the dish. I did not send this dish back because I was just completely over it already. We lost our appetite. THREE dishes sent back... no apology, no acknowledgement, no table touches, no manager. For a situation like this, a manager SHOULD HAVE stopped by our table. Maybe he/she was not physically there and just left their card with the FOH or maybe he/she was actually there and just did not give a you-know-what. Either way... UNACCEPTABLE!! Corporate should really come out to this location and retrain EVERYONE. The staff here need some leadership and supervision-- including management and the kitchen staff.",90802

You have a feeling of privacy at your table. It's located in Shoreline Village, a bustling area with many restaurants and ocean side activities.The menu is vast. You could come every night of the week and easily order something different. They offer some new promotional dishes, one of which I ordered - Korean steak bulgogi.I started with crab wontons, which were ok. They weren't as crispy as I'd hoped. The crab flavor was a little lackluster.The Korean steak bulgogi was a flame grilled 10oz New York strip marinated with Korean spices in a sesame soy glaze. The steak was surprisingly tender. It was thinly sliced. The accompanying glaze and vegetables (Asian mushrooms, bean sprouts, carrots) really elevated the flavors of the dish. Overall, I was impressed.The chicken lettuce wraps were quite tasty. The kids noodles were flavorful and al dente. They had a nice chew to them - not undercooked, but just right.Jameson was our server and he was spot on. I would return to PF Chang's. There's plenty of other dishes to try!",90802

I didn't think it was possible but it was.  They cooked it for way too long so it was mushy and the skin basically was peeling off as part of the bean.  The pork ribs were just ok.We ordered the noodles and fruits off the kids menu.  We also ordered the miso salmon with mushroom and bokchoy and the seafood with filet (can't remember the exact name).  The salmon was over cooked and dry and the vegetables had no flavor.  I literally asked for more miso sauce so I could at least dip.  The steak and seafood were nothing spectacular.  The fruit that we ordered with the kids noodles... well they literally took one tiny strawberry and cut it into as many pieces as they could and A grape and did the same.  It was served in a dish that looked the dish you use to mix your soy sauce with wasabi.  The noodles were actually good, so I ended up eating that since my son didn't want it.Overall, the quality of the food faltered.  Everything looks and sounds amazing as you read the menu but you eat with your mouth not with your eyes and they failed.  #Uberfail.  They get two stars though because our server and hostess were good.  This was purely a review on food.

220,"340 S Pine Ave Long Beach, CA 90802",Andrew H.,"Madison, WI",6/17/2015,3,"Overview: This P.F. Chang's on the Long Beach Rainbow Pier is a tastefully decorated and beautifully located Chinese restaurant that serves Americanized Chinese food. To feed 3, expect to pay about $60+ with tax and tip. When I came on a Saturday afternoon, I was literally the only Asian person in the restaurant which tells you a little bit about their high pricing/low authenticity, but I must admit this is much cleaner and classier experience than the average Chinese hole in the wall that I'm used to.The Food:  Honey Shrimp (amazing), Twice Fried Noodles (secret menu and amazing), spicy green beans (okay), and Mongolian Beef (good). The Honey Shrimp are a must-order. Slight crispy exterior, tender soft interior, wonderful honey glaze. Big bites. Oh gosh I'm drooling just writing this review. The Twice Fried Noodles are also of this ""upper echelon"" of Chinese food. Crunchy, covered in a salty delicious glaze, and topped with the meat of your choice. I chose pork and didn't enjoy it (small, tough, mediocre), but if I come back, I would try the beef. The Mongolian Beef is nice and tender but not as succulent as say the marinaded beef (bulgogi) you could find at a Korean BBQ restaurant. The spicy green beans are just meh.The Establishment: The restaurant is quite large with both indoor and outdoor seating. Indoor seating is fairly dim and thus I preferred the bright outdoors. Unfortunately there is no ocean view and the view from the outdoor patio is only of the pop-up stores on the walkway. Tables, servers, and dishware can all be described as clean, and classy. Not ""gaudy"" like some Asian restaurants except for the giant horse sculpture in the front. Valet parking is available but they can also validate parking for the large parking garage on the west side of the pier. It's only a 5 minute walk and it's an extremely pleasant and scenic walk so I would recommend it if you're coming here for lunch. It's gets a little ""shadier"" at night so I might choose the valet if I was coming here on a date. Birthday people are treated to a small banana-egg-roll coconut ice cream dish on the house (worth about $3).The Service: I came at Saturday at noon and the restaurant was at about 10% capacity. I did not feel my server was particularly attentive, but he was helpful, patient, and respectful. The food came at a decent pace and seating was quick and easy.Conclusions: This P.F. Chang's is an upscale Chinese fusion restaurant located on the beautifully maintained Rainbow Pier in Long Beach that would be amazing if they had lower prices, better service, and more tender cuts of pork and beef. The Honey Shrimp combined with twice-fried noodles in my opinion is one of the best combinations in all Asian-fusion cuisine and might deserve 5-stars, but the restaurant as a whole only deserves 3-stars for its high pricing, mediocre food besides the honey shrimp and twice fried noodles, and only average service.",90802
221,"340 S Pine Ave Long Beach, CA 90802",Richard J.,"Bellflower, CA",5/23/2017,5,"I LOVE PF Changs with a passion!  I have been to over 10 different locations in Southern California, Northern California, Nevada and Utah.  One of my favorite things about PF Chang's is the consistency.  I would say that at least 95% of the time, the waiter or waitress has gotten our order correct.  I can not say that about other major chain restaurants.This particular location is close to the water near Shoreline Village.  They offer valet parking or street parking depending on your preference.I always get the lettuce wraps and recommend strongly that you do the same!  Trust me, you will thank me later!  I love their lettuce wraps and have turned on quite a few people to them.  They can be a little bit addicting. My wife and I usually get the Mongolian Beef as well as the sweet and sour chicken or the chicken fried rice.  The only dish I have tried that I don't like is the Orange Chicken.  There were pieces of orange peel which made it very sour.  Yuck!Sometimes they have a deal which includes 1 appetizer (lettuce wraps), 2 soup bowls, 2 main course entrees and 1 dessert for $40.  It is a lot of food and delicious.  This would be the route I would take if they have the entrees that you like.",90802

Portions were small, plates were SO overpriced and everything lacked flavor.

225,"340 S Pine Ave Long Beach, CA 90802",Stevo O.,"San Gabriel, CA",5/20/2017,4,"My wife calls this American Chinese food, with a fork.  Although chop sticks are available, your entree is served normally with knife and fork; not your traditional utensil in China.  As for food, it has all the makings of tasty dishes that are off-shoots of more recognized Cantonese dishes with a western spin.  My honey-walnut shrimp with melon balls were delicious, although not what I'm used to in Chinatown or Monterey Park restaurants.  The restaurant itself is very clean and decorative, which is also a far cry from the bland-looking restaurant interiors in Chinatown.  If I were entertaining relatives from the Orient, I probably would not think of this restaurant first, but it does a decent job of simulating quality Chinese food at a moderately higher price, than you would find in an Asian community restaurant.  The location however is very entertaining, and allows visitors to experience Long Beach and all that it has to offer.",90802

228,"340 S Pine Ave Long Beach, CA 90802",Richard P.,"Long Beach, CA",8/29/2018,1,"On Monday 8/27/2018 I went to P.F. Chang's in downtown Long Beach, on Pine at Shoreline Village with my buddy for dinner. We set at the bar, and got waited on by the very charming and helpful bartender Nicole. Nicole was the only part of this meal that was good. We started our order off with some Dim Sum, which consisted of 2-House-Made Pork Egg Rolls and 2-House-Made Chicken Egg Rolls. I don't think I've ever had a bad Egg Roll anywhere, but then there were these. They were Luke warm and bland, and the crust was a bit on the soggy side. So, immediately our dinner was off to a bad start. For our main course, we ordered  Singapore Black Pepper Chicken and Orange Peel Chicken. To start off, the food was as close to being cold, without actually being cold as you could get. Normally I would have sent the food back, but it was already late and I hadn't eaten anything all day long, so I just ate it. The dishes had no distinctive flavor and were very poorly seasoned to say the least. Also, on the Orange Peel Chicken, you typically will find pieces of actual orange peel in the dish, which help give it that distinctive ""Orange"" flavor however, there was absolutely none to be found. In fact, there was almost no distinctive orange flavor in this dish at all. Additionally, the chicken was extremely dried out and tough and hard to chew. The chicken in the Singapore Black Pepper Chicken was also very tough, and tremendously lacked any distinctive flavor or seasoning. I could go on, but I'd rather stop here in the hopes that they can turn things around. Who knows, perhaps the head chef was off this night, or just having a horribly bad day. To put things into perspective though, I can honestly say that the food at fast-food Chinese Restaurant Chains like Pick-up Stix and Panda Express is hands-down way better then what we had this night at this higher end national Asian Fusion Restaurant chain.Lastly, I've been to P.F. Chang's many, many times over the years, and for the most part was always impressed with their food and presentation. However, the last 3-times I've eaten at this particular P.F. Chang's, my visits have each been more disappointing then the previous. Perhaps (and I do hope), it is just this one particular P.F. Chang's and not the whole chain! Need-less-to-say, I don't think I'll ever go back to this particular P.F. Chang's ever again and I may not ever go back to any other P.F. Chang's either for that matter. To top it all off, the bill for 2 people for 2-entree's and two appetizers with 1-glass of ice-tea and 1-glass of water, with tax and tip was $71.00. Mind you, I could have asked to talk to the manager and complained, however it was late and I was extremely tired and just wanted to get home and go to bed.The one and only highlight of the whole meal was our server/bartender Nicole. She gave us great service and was pleasant to talk to and always had a smile on her face. She was very professional and gave us great service. If only the food would have been as good. Had it not been for Nicole, I would have given them 0 out of 5 stars",90802

It took them forever to just get us drinks.  And after taking our order it took forever to get our stuff. Boooo!Ambiance: I understand when restaurants try to make it romantic by slightly turning the lights down but this place doesn't do that right, at all!  It suddenly turned super dark I could hardly see my dish.  We noticed some of the employees lighting the one candle that was placed in the middle of the tables but they never got to us so we got to dine the rest of the time in the dark.  Fail!  Did I mention we were dining with kids?  The entire dining experience felt stupid.Food:  Most of the food was ok.  Nothing special.  I ended up getting one of the more ""special"" looking items on the menu which was a dish with all kinds of seafood including lobster tails.  Not only did my dish looking NOTHING like the picture, it was sloppy and gross looking.  The fresh veggies turned out to be overcooked green beans that were black and some sad potatoes.  The lobster tail was split open and grilled but they must have cracked the tails open over my dish because I occasionally bit into lobster shell bits.  I ended up cutting my tongue on a sharp piece of lobster tail.  WTF!?  Even after pointing it out they seemed annoyed with me for saying something.  Uh, hello? I'm bleeding into my plate and this is not normal.  Ugh, the entire experience was lame.I wanted to like it but NOPE.Sorry, I can't recommend this place.",90802

One dollar for parking - cha ching.  Shrimp with lobster sauce is one of my go to Chinese favorites. The sauce is made with chicken stock, pork, fermented black beans, water chestnuts, green onions, and eggs which are stirred into the sauce and they make the sauce super silky.  This is a savory, not sweet dish. Sweetness has never entered into this recipe, which I have been eating for 40+ years.  The sad rendition of shrimp with lobster sauce made by the chef at this PF Changs was sweet with unappetizing sauce, and fried eggs.  My husbands favorite is fried rice with chicken. While the taste was good, you needed a microscope to find the chicken, there must've been about five bean sprouts in the entire order, no green onions and no egg. How is it possible to make fried rice without egg?I also ordered eggplant, which despite it being quite sweet, was marginally OK. It would have been better had it not been quite so sweet.  The pork eggrolls were terrific, and tasted very much like my own.

The only reason why we came was because my boyfriend and I got a gift card to this restaurant or else we would have never came. The prices for the foods is high in my opinion. You can get these type of food in a mom and pop shop for way less.  So, we decided to just come for happy hours which was 3:00 pm - 6:00 pm weekdays.Upon arrival, we were greeted by a hostess and was guided to our seat right away. I looked around and saw there was a bar that only two people there. The rest of the restaurant didn't look that busy. As we sat down, I noticed there were rice crumbs on the ground to the side of our table that haven't been pick up, and my table surface was sticky. They didn't do a good job of wiping the table down. So, we order the orange ginger edamame, homemade vegetable dumpling, and ahi tartare with avocado. For drinks, we were told they ran out of Sam Adam, MANAGER CHOICE CRAFT AND TSINGTAO LAGER which was three out of the four beers on their happy hour list. KEEP IN MIND WE CAME  around 20 minutes after happy hours have started. HOW DID THEY RAN OUT OF THEIR HAPPY HOUR BEERS IN 20 MIN AND THE RESTAURANT WASN'T EVEN PACK??? So, we both decided to get the Ballast Point Scuplin which wasn't on the happy hour list. The next problem i have with this place was service was slow. The waiter was nice but the service was just slow. It took more then 10 minutes to get our beer and and we sat right next to the bar. Oh, and the worst part was there was only 2 other person at the actual bar!!! The food came out about 20 minutes later.The ginger edamame was good and the ahi. Vegetable dumpling was horrible and it came in three small pieces. The ahi  came in three small pieces but it tasted great.

266,"340 S Pine Ave Long Beach, CA 90802",R M.,"Laguna Hills, CA",5/11/2018,5,"Hello to all of you picky food lovers like me.  This is my second YELP review of the PF Chang's located on Pine St, Long Beach, CA  PF Chang's at this location on Pine St. is the Hallmark of great Restaurants;  the Gold Standard of great food.  Superior freshness, atmosphere and service is what you receive every time you make the great decision to have a meal here. All of this is at great prices as well. It was my 67th birthday celebration and you would have thought that I was a famous Restaurant Critic the way we were treated.   However, I happen to know that PF Chang's makes all of it's guest feel that they deserve the very best and that is what you will receive.    It was a beautiful day yesterday so we ate outside.  We had spectacular appetizers.  3 of them  to be sure we made little piggies of ourselves.  We had the vegetable spring rolls and they are the best that any of us have ever had in our very long lives.  Why even the mushrooms were super fresh and sautéed in butter and placed in the rolls with the other veggies.  All of the dipping sauces were divine.  We had the pan fried shrimp dumplings and added the pan fried pork dumplings in the mix as well.  The dumplings are the very best we have ever eaten; a must have when you come for a meal. The garlic sauces were to live for.  We all had dinner entree's, not the lunch specials (after all it was my birthday) and they all were to live for.  The house Merlot is fantastic and they know how to make a great gin and tonic.The service from both David and Gabriel (The Server Extraordinaire) was spot on.  We felt very taken care of and with such nice smiles; just excellent.Then there was the dessert...Oh my, Oh my, Oh my!!!  Whether it is your birthday or not you must have some of PF Chang's desserts.  Every time we dine at PF Chang's we  have had amazing treats.  I am a cook and a baker and they do it right!From the moment we were greeted and seated by the lovely Elaine and got a hello from Nick, (a GM.)  we had the time of our lives.  Clearly Nick and his amazing staff take great pride in themselves and great pride in providing the freshest food in a most appealing way.  This restaurant knows how to cook.  Everything was pure perfection.So to all of you diners out there be sure and have a million meals at PF Chang's on Pine St. Long Beach, CA Thank you to all.  Robin & Jim & Charles",90802
267,"340 S Pine Ave Long Beach, CA 90802",David M.,"South Gate, CA",2/17/2019,2,Normally a go to place for our family but our visit Saturday Feb 16 was bad.  Our sons 12th B Day and he  chooses P.F. and looks forward to it all day.  We arrive around 5:40pm and are told our wait would be 45-60 mins.  Then was told wait would be shorter if we were willing to sit outside.  We chose whichever was faster.  We then waited 45-50 mins when we were called to be seated.  We were not notified where we would be seated just asked to follow them to our seats. We were walked to what seemed to be a storage area for single tables by the entrance.  We had to wait for a couple of tables to be put together and turn on a heater.  Once seated we had to wait a little over 5 mins for a waiter to come get our drink order.  We don't see the waiter for another 5 mins when he brings the drinks.  We then order to get going since the wind is picking up and temperature dropping.  At that point I walk to the front to talk to a hostess about moving us inside.  The hostess I talk to is is trying to work with us when the other hostess which seems to be the vocal one in the front interrupts rudely and states they can not do nothing and we would have to wait 35+ mins.  I then stayed to the first hostess working with us that we had ordered our food already and she stated she would get us in before the 35 mins.  5 mins after talking to her a manager comes outside and says there is nothing they can do to get us in.  Food was quick and had arrived almost at the same time the manager showed up so we had begun to eat before the food and utensils would fly away due to the high winds.  We were the only people seated in that area and do not even have plates or silver ware.  I understand they were busy but that was no way to treat anyone nor sit in that area with the temp dropping and high winds. Needless to say we were very disappointed and upset that my son did not enjoy his 12th b day dinner he was looking forward to.,90802

269,"340 S Pine Ave Long Beach, CA 90802",Avner M.,"Las Vegas, NV",6/21/2014,2,"This place was a very busy place in Long Beach.  We came in with a large party and were given a time for the wait.  It seemed like they only had ONE area they used for big parties and there was a party already sitting there.  After 2 hours the party sitting there had paid there bill already and was just hanging out not ordering anything else.  Management did not want to bother them so instead we waited and waited and waited....Finally we got to sit and you think the manager made an attempt to assist, NOPE.  We had one waiter taking all the drink orders for 27 people.  Then we waited for the drinks to come before he could take appetizer orders.  Then while getting drink refills we waited to place food orders.I don't need to go on, the bottom line, the manager was not on top of the organization on this particular evening.  What normally is a great experience at PF Chang's turned out to be a marathon and its not really because of the wait, but because once seated, it was another GOOD 3 hours to get through the meal with all the waiting.Suggestions for the future to the Manager, on big parties over 10, have at least 2 servers, make sure the bus staff comes around and helps the servers with drink refills and if you are short on servers or they are overwhelmed, step up and pitch in as CUSTOMER SERVICE should be your highest priority not walking around looking stressed.  Stepping in will not only show your staff you are not afraid to get your hands dirty, they will be more appreciative of you and your help.  You get paid the big bucks to be a leader not an observer.Other then that, the food was good, its P.F.

273,"340 S Pine Ave Long Beach, CA 90802",Linda D.,"Long Beach, CA",8/29/2016,2,"Had a really weird dinner here for a friend's birthday celebration. One of our friends has very particular dietary restrictions for medical reasons, so PF Chang's seemed safe for everyone to find something they liked/could eat. The food was fine but we were seated outside on some strange benches that had sinking seats. We noticed it immediately but it wasn't until near the end of the meal that we all felt uncomfortable--especially when we stood up. This sucked considering everything else about the outdoor patio is pretty lovely! Service was pretty wonky. We had a few servers and some orders were wrong. One server left us with the food and said he would just add on the corrected order and make sure we weren't charged anything extra. But our bill was still off. The server who gave us our bill put one check in front of a friend who assumed that she would be coming back with the rest of our checks, but she ended up being charged for everyone's food. I think there were a lot of misunderstandings which stemmed from poor communication from the waitstaff. Not super down to come back.",90802

Thank goodness this one in Long Beach was so much better.I was invited by a good friend of mine from out of town for a late lunch with a group of her coworkers, a group of 53 people to be exact. We occupied 2 very long tables and 1 big round table. The service was excellent!!!! Staff were very friendly, egaging and was on top of things. The food came in a timely manner and everything we had was delicious. We had a lot of appetizers and main dishes. I didn't do the ordering so I don't rememeber all the names of the food. However, one dish that stood out to me most was the HONEY WALNUT SHRIMP with HONEY DEW BALLS. I've never had it with honey dew and it was amazing!

If you are looking to have a nice romantic night out than this is the place. It is nice, dark, and the booths are all very private and intimate. I don't have some guy from across the booths right in my face the arrangement is perfect. Whenever we come here my husband and I it is a must that we get the lettuce chicken wraps. They are amazing,if I didn't have to share I wouldn't I could eat it all by myself, I really could meaning that they give you a good amount! My favorite entrees are shrimp in lobster sauce (although I think they might have discontinued this) and the Mongolian beef. I have tried the sweet and sour soup and the orange chicken, let me tell you just save your money and order something else both of these taste straight out of a frozen bag and package. There's really nothing special about the food, other than the appetizer I stand by that one because it is really good.The service is always on point, I never get to finish my drink before a refill is right in front of me. This is something I am very big on considering that I am a person who needs to take a sip after every bite. They make sure you have everything you want, and never forget to offer deserts in the end. We cannot finish a meal here without getting the cheesecake, the display is romantic. The cheesecake has changed my life, if I could live on cheesecakes, this place might be one of the ones I frequent to survive, love it. I enjoy the intimate setting it is not so crazy loud that you can't take either, I enjoy a good conversation with my husband while we are here. This is one of our date night spots, again warning do not expect the best food, you kind of have to figure out what you like as I described above!",90802

Kung pow not even spicy...no flavor, no spice,bland, and dry. The restrooms were disgusting and desperately in need of service, If you can judge the kitchen based on the restroom then this is not a good choice! Not worth the wait or the $15.00 price tag for a small serving of bland and dry kung pow. Would have complained but the waiter was nowhere to be found. I also had the fried dumplings which were only ""fried"" on one side (burned to be specific) and not fried on any other side, about $10 for 4 of those.

Yeah, I know it's a chain Chinese food place, not especially authentic, no street cred with the foodies for eating here. That's ok. I still like it. The food is consistent and tasty. The service is generally friendly and prompt. Even when it's crowded, we seem to get seated and served quickly which I appreciate. It's super family friendly which I appreciate these days. The staff has been very accomodating of my toddlers as far as seating, special menu requests, etc. I still really like the chicken lettuce wraps, the mongolian beef, and the sweet and sour pork. The garlic snap peas aren't on the menu anymore but they still make them for me which I also super love. My only complaint about this place is the parking, it sucks. Like all the parking down town, it's super expensive, hard to get in and out of, if it's a super busy night it's valet only which I really hate. The valet lot is so far, it's really faster to walk or self park. The meters are the other option, which is not horrible since you can pay with a card now, but still.",90802

I've never had a bad meal here. The food and service never disappoints. We were on a little bit of a time crunch because we were going to go to the ""CHILL"" at the Queen Mary that evening. Our server brought our drinks out quickly and our food came out in a timely manner as well. It was so nice and much appreciated. Especially since last time we were on a time crunch for a Queen Mary event (we ate at the nearby Chili's), it took forever and we ended up getting there way later than we wanted to. So thank you very much P F Changs for making our night even more enjoyable!! The entrees here are generous, so order a few for the table and enjoy it family style, that way you can try a little bit of everything. Also do yourself a favor and order the lettuce wraps. They are super delicious, crisp, and hands down awesome. I also was pleased to see that they had sushi on the menu. Even though this is a Chinese restaurant, the sushi did not disappoint!! It's pricey but the servings are good and the food is great. Also, parking can be difficult since this P F Changs is located at the Pike. It also will cost you money.

Chang's for over a decade and have always had a great time and left with a full belly, so naturally after about 7 of my girlfriends and I left an amazing event at the harbor, we thought it'd be a great idea to hop on over for some great food and a few drinks.Upon arriving, we were told that since we had such a large group it would be a bit of a wait. No problem!  We figured we'd just hang out at the bar and order a few drinks while we waited. It being 8pm on a Sunday night, the bar was rather empty; so empty that 8 women had no problem finding seats all sitting next to each other.  All seemed well.  We sat down and began engaging the bar tender, Mike. He was blatantly uncomfortable interacting with us and had a deplorable attitude.  When one of my friends began to order her drink, he excused himself only to return with his manager.  She stated that they would not be able to serve us at the bar and we must wait to order drinks until we were seated!  When asked why, she said ""one member of your party was stumbling and we can't serve people past the point of intoxication"".  Really? Since when do you kick a group of 8 people out of a bar because one (unidentified) member was [supposedly] too intoxicated?  Beyond that, she stated ""we have the right to refuse service to anyone"".   This is incredibly unfortunate, as we had a lot of money to spend, are excellent tippers, and the restaurant and bar were not particularly full.  They chose to forego our business because one person (here's lookin' at you, Mike!) was ""uncomfortable"".   As previously stated, I've been a customer of P.F. Chang's for over a decade and as a result of this I will never, ever patronize another P.F. Chang's again, I will discourage any person I know from ever patronizing another P.F. Chang's again, and I will file a formal complaint to corporate.   Tokyo Waco, by the way, wanted our money, exhibited excellent customer service and had excellent food.",90802

To my shock, having made a reservation in advance on OpenTable and being sent a confirmation message, we still were not able to get a table. We were informed that making reservations with OpenTable on Father's Day will not accept the reservation. OpenTable does not recognize the reservation being overrided by the restaurant. We were sent a confirmation unknowingly showing up to not be taken until over an hour later. I'm disappointed in the ability of the restaurant to inform the users of a trusted app that their reservations will not be taken on these special occasions.

The dessert ruined us. We ordered a cheesecake mini and it came out tasting like mold. My friends throat started to go into shock because of it. She can't even have blue cheese. I was very disappointed in that. We ordered a full cheesecake instead which in my opinion should have been a comp since they tried to kill us.

I got the Mongolian Beef and it was great, I really liked the texture, flavor & slight spice. Imagine a better ver of Panda express beijing beef. The person with me got Orange Chicken & Pork Dumplings, we both did not like the orange chicken but we think it's because we love the orange chicken from Panda Express & other places similar and P.F's orange chicken was super citrusy & had orange peels in it so ya I'm guessing lots like it but it wasn't our thing & we wished we didn't get it but i wouldn't hold it against the place because I'm guessing that's how it prob is at alot of other Asian restaurants but it wasn't our thing... Also got soup with the lunch special, I got sweet & sour soup, it was good, I've never had a soup like this be4 so I was thinking why not but it did have tofu squares in it that I didn't like at all, felt really strange eating it for me haha, I'd reccoment the other soup we got though, the egg drop soup, it tasted kind of like a chicken broth. Only downside was the rice, I got steamed rice(white rice) and it was $1 extra for some reason yet it tasted not so great and wasn't sticky at all",90802

Even though Paul Flaming sold this restaurant it's wonderful to know that the new owers kept up with Paul's concepts and recipes.  Coming from NYC, I can be a snob when it comes to good chinese food. Eating here always makes me think of the great restaurants in San Francisco  or NYC.

We do not have a PF Chang's where I live in Canada, so I only get to visit this restaurant when I travel to the states.Service was excellent, waitress was very sweet and went the extra mile.Ordered two veggie spring rolls, kung pow shrimp and veggie pad thai. The kung pow was really delish, pad thai was not authentic, but was OK!There was a little bit of confusion when we were asked what kind of rice we wanted with our meal. I asked for veggie fried rice thinking that was an option. Apparently it was not but the waitress checked to see if the cook was able to make it. We told her not to worry about it and we just asked for white rice with our meals.She was able to get the veggie rice cooked and brought it out in separate bowls with our meals. (we really did not want to eat all that rice, but we thought it was a nice gesture). The fried rice lacked. I tried to spruce it up with the sauces on the table, but it was pretty bad. Tasted like bad whole wheat bread. YUCK!Luckily it was not put on our bills, so that was a nice gesture.Overall. Service was great, food was not a great as I remembered. I did not remember it being so greasy. But, I got my PF Chang fix for the year.",90802

Hostess in the front was not warm or welcoming in any way but that was the least of our worries. We were sat outside per my daughters request again, but in the lost corner, in no mans land!, SAT IN A BROKEN CHAIR TO START!, Ordered our drinks and waited a bit to receive Ice Tea and water!.. I ordered a Moscow Mule which was served in a small glass not copper mug:(. Because waiter explained all the copper mugs were stoled. Hmmm very interesting:(.  Next we order our food which took normal time I imagine but no refills of ice tea or water and no sugar or sweatner EVER for our Ice tea were given until almost our meal was over.. No refills of water during our meals EVER...just kept getting worse... We had to ask another waistress around for the items we needed for our table as our Waiter was scarce... At last we ordered desert and never were we asked for Coffee or extra water, YOU KNOW UP SALE FOR YOU GUY!!.. Don't you want to make more money?? Offer your guest coffee or extra water refills with their dessert and maybe there time spent wont be so shitty!!I have heard such great things about PF chang's and was excited to come, however this will be our last time!! and I will be sure to spread the word!.. Again another restaurant that needs to take the time and train your staff and proper costumer service, it is very simple to check on your table and check if everyone is okay at times.. that NEVER HAPPENED WITH US AND THE PLACE WAS NOT BUSY AT THE TIME. JUST BAD SERVICE ALL AROUND.!!! Maybe other location are better, but this place needs to close and build another restaurant in its place!! May be invest in a good burger joint!:(",90802

320,"340 S Pine Ave Long Beach, CA 90802",Angie Z.,"Long Beach, CA",5/10/2017,1,"Was extremely disappointed with this location. This past Friday, May 5th was our weddings rehearsal dinner. We had a large party I believe of 18 so we knew we had to book a reservation. So we called to make one the Monday before and were told no problem, reservation was set. We arrive at 6:45 for our 7:00 reservation only to be told that we didn't have one in our name. Umm what?! We for sure made one especially knowing it was cinco de mayo, a Friday night and some of our dinner guests who were in the wedding were coming as far as Hemet. Which with traffic on the 91 freeway was about two hours plus. We sure the heck made a reservation! The blonde girl behind the desk was hardly apologetic telling us we must have made it at another location. No honey we knew we wanted THIS LOCATION because OUR location is also LONG BEACH. So the blonde tries to make herself look busy for a few minutes and tells us the only thing she can do for our party is sit us outside and it will take about 45 minutes to be seated. Now normally it would be ok to sit outside but I and most of the ladies in my wedding party were in dresses and it was a cold and chilly night. Besides that most of the restaurant was empty. You would think knowing it was a special occasion she would attempt to be more accommodating. But I guess that's something they're not trained to do at PF Changs. So we ended up leaving, walking to Gladstone's and we're treated very graciously. The waitress who had found out it was our rehearsal dinner cleared out the back room for our party, changed tables around and was super attentive the entire night. Without having a reservation. That's how you show your customers they're important to you. We won't be coming back to PF Changs any time soon.",90802

The Long Beach PF's is no different then any of the rest. It's over ranked and very pricey for what you get.

It was only $13. What a deal. When everyone got there we sat down got to know each other. The waiter was great with us. We were 7 and having 4 conversations at once. We ordered off the 2 for 40 on the menu. But we all ordered something different. Unfortunately didn't take pic all the entire meals. But we ate and shared everything family style. I recommend it to all families. Well it worked with us. A couple things we had. General Tso chicken great a bit spicy. The spicy chicken good not as spicy. At least I think. Steak and something but it was really good. We had the lobster avocado roll as an app and then some ordered it also again for a meal. So good enough to get it twice.,90802

Chang's (and I remembered that I had the same thought a year ago as well). Portion was adequate, though, and I didn't leave hungry. Spice level was good. The sriracha chilies really up the heat on the dish. I also ordered the ginger beer which was very nice. A friend also got the ginger beer, but said it was a bit too sweet for his tastes. His plate of Kung Pow looked decent, but again, not as heaping as I remember. Flavors were good, no complaints. Service was spot on and friendly, and the place was hopping thanks to what looked like some sort of cheerleading event in town. Overall, good meal, no complaints...

The host was unpleasantly rude and unwilling to accommodate my wife and two young children with safer booth seating even though the restaurant was nearly empty. She got into a minor argument with another employee outside, so maybe she was simply having a bad day. However, it was unappreciated to say the least. Waitress was polite, food was terrible! Spicy tuna rolls with no flavor and what seemed to be albacore. Crispy honey chicken that was more like soggy overly sweet chicken that was frozen in a plastic bag and microwaved on order.

The Korean chicken was tasty, though a bit more fried than I would have preferred. The Ma Po Tofu was extremely, amazingly salty, and oozing with oil in every bite. The Quinoa was inedible - dry, crunchy and hard in places, and not at all resembling the texture I expect for Quinoa.

However, our waitress, Dorria (forgive me if I miss typed her name), kept on disappearing. No drink refills, didn't serve the other tables. We were waiting 20 minutes for her to come by to give us our check. Very bad service and it was obvious that manager didn't care to follow up to ensure service.",90802
348,"340 S Pine Ave Long Beach, CA 90802",Fiona H.,"Redondo Beach, CA",1/5/2015,3,"I hadn't been to a P.F. Chang's in yeeeeeeeeeears and while it was definitely was better than my last experience, I still don't think the food is as good today as it was when the chain first appeared. The location is nice and seems to get very busy but the food is basically what you'd expect from this chain. Fortunately we had an amazing waitress and some very interesting people to watch while we waited for our food and drinks. Drinks took a little longer than expected but as I said, it was busy. Waitress was very apologetic and was on top of service the whole time. Can't blame her for the bar being slow!Anyway, on to food:Chicken lettuce wraps - always good, can't go wrong ordering that appetizer. Hot and sour soup - decent but I've had betterKung Pao Chicken - just ok and a little dryCrispy Honey Chicken - very good, not too sweet and with a nice hint of ginger.. A dish I'd never had before but definitely would order againDan Dan Noodles - typically my favorite dish but very underwhelming this time. This is the only place where I've seen them offer to toss the noodles at the table AND pour extra oil on top. I'd never seen them add the extra oil before but it totally killed the delicious spicy flavor that I was expecting. Orange Peel Beef - another good dish but I felt that it could be better like the kung paoOverall this is a pretty decent P.F. Chang's, mostly because the location is nice. The only drawback is probably the parking situation but if you're in this area of Long Beach that's already a given. If you're in the mood for Americanized chain Chinese food, this place is A-Ok!",90802

361,"340 S Pine Ave Long Beach, CA 90802",MeatEater H.,"Stanton, CA",12/16/2016,3,"Came here because a business associate gave me some gift cards for this place. I ate at the Anaheim one many years ago and I vaguely remember, so it was probably just so so. This location is just as dark as the Anaheim one. I hate dark restaurants because they are usually trying to hide something. First impression was not too good. Restaurant was 3/4 empty and the hostess tried to sit us next to the bathroom. WTF mang? I don't like to smell my own poop while I'm eating and there is no way I'm eating while smelling someone else's-especially on a weekday. Weekends, maybe.So we found a seat by ourselves near the window. It was a good location, but there was lettuce (2 large pieces) on the floor. When the hostess tried to pick it up, the mayonnaise (or ranch dressing or bleu cheese) smudged all over the carpet. It looked nasty, like someone cummed all over the floor. As if I wanted to pay to see cum on a restaurant floor...I can get that for free on LA's skid row.Now this was when it started to get better. Yes, the food came out. We ordered the chicken lettuce wrap and spicy tuna roll for appetizers....before I go any further, DO NOT ORDER the spicy tuna. It has a very strong fishy taste to it. Freaking nasty as hell. Almost threw up my morning coffee. But the lettuce wrap was perfect. Not the best, but at least it wasn't fishy and gross like the tun roll. I think they did that on purpose by having us eat the nasty fish first, almost throw up and then giving us the decent lettuce wrap. Anyways, it was good. Our main entree came out shortly after and the Hong King Style sea bass was also decent as was the Thai spicy chicken thingy (I forget the exact name). The sea bass was really under flavored, but that's much better than the too salty places. We just added some of the sauce from the lettuce wrap and it was perfect. The chicken dish didn't need anything. In sum, the restaurant is too dark for my taste buds. It's a decent Fusion Chinese restaurant, but of course nowhere near as good as the place I go to in Buena Park. I don't want give up the name because that place is already crowded enough and the last thing I want is more people going there. The food is not too salty, the chicken dish needed to be had with a little rice.l because it was on the salty side...but it was perfect with rice. In all, I'd give this place another try if I wanted to take a date, who liked Chinese food due to it's ""atmosphere"". They do offer outside seating, but it was too damn cold for that. But, for serious Chinese food, nothing beats my little secret spot in Buena Park.",90802

We have been here before and as busy as they were, the service and food were much improved (not that we have ever had a bad experience, but sometimes when busy, it takes a bit longer to get seated and served). We had a wonderful time!Our server was David (not Asian as I saw in another post). He was amazing; perfect mix of professionalism with being friendly. We didn't wait too long to be greeted at our table, but I think manager thought we were because he comes to our table and says ""kitchen made a mistake; here's lettuce wraps on the house."" We had already ordered and just said thank you! We ordered cup of soup for me, sweet and sour, crispy honey shrimp and wow, the ""surf & turf"" wild-caught lobster, cubed filet mignon, yukon gold potatoes, asparagus, and shitake mushrooms. Amazing. I don't remember potatoes in the dish, but didn't matter. Everything was so delicious and the filet mignon was tender. So, to be honest, we couldn't remember if we had ordered crispy honey shrimp or chicken, because when I went to place crispy honey shrimp on my plate I stopped and said ""this doesn't look like shrimp...?"" We saw the waiter and we were honest and asked did we order chicken or shrimp? He said shrimp...so everything was great and we took home extra food and service was impeccable and David kept the drinks coming.  Thank you P.F. Chang's, thank you David!",90802

We love the happy hour specials like the lettuce wraps. I also like the crispy green beans and spicy cauliflower Yummy. They have a spicy tuna roll and California roll on the happy hour as well. They have a rewards program and we get a free entree after just a few visits. A great value. I recommend,90802

Located at the Pike in LB, this P.F. Chang's looks like every other P.F.'s out there. We dined at P.F.'s on a Friday night. The wait for our party of three (we had my vegetarian cousin with us) was like 30 min. Why this place gets so busy is beyond me. Anyways, we started with an order of their famous Chang's chicken lettuce wraps and an order of veggie lettuce wraps. Both were good. In fact, I honestly believe the chicken wraps are the only item I love on P.F.'s menu. For our main entrees we ordered Mongolian beef, crispy honey chicken and spicy green beans. Mongo beef was actually good. The beef was juicy and tender and had a great flavor. The crispy honey chicken, sadly, was not crunchy at all. It tasted like nasty orange chicken you would find at a crummy fast food Chinese joint. The spicy green beans were decent but could have been much spicier. Even though the place was packed, our food was brought to us quickly. Our waitress was really friendly and attentive. Even though I'm not the biggest fan of P.F. Chang's my meal here was not bad. I'm in no hurry to go back but if the wifey gets another lettuce wrap craving, I won't whine as much as I did on this visit.",90802

Eddie felt bad but we figured it is what it is & were ready to put it behind us. We ordered our food & guess what Eddie (AKA The greatest server ever "") did?  He got us another Free entre on the house!  He told us His goal was to treat others as he would like to be treated.

389,"340 S Pine Ave Long Beach, CA 90802",Rebecca S.,"Sacramento, CA",11/22/2017,1,"Worst PF Chang's experience nation wide. We arrived at 3pm in time for happy hour and lunch specials. The restaurant was prety empty with lots of employees hanging out. An employee, David, came to our booth around 3:35pm but did not identify himself. He said he couldn't take our order, although we were ready, but would return with water soon. At 3:45pm we still hadn't gotten water. He showed up a second time around 3:50pm with water but was in a hurry and only took our drink and appetizer order before disappearing again. He still hadn't introduced himself so we didn't know if he was our server or someone else covering for our server. Our appetizers were delivered around 4pm by someone else which made it more confusing. We still didn't get our drinks. By this time we were annoyed with the bad service we were getting. David finally returned for the 3rd time around 4:20pm with drinks and to take our order. Someone at our table told him we were missing 1 out of the 3 appetizers we ordered earlier. David got very defensive and told us we never ordered 3 appetizers and he needed us to hurry up and order our entrees because HE had other tables to serve and HE had already wasted too much time coming to our table. Not only did he blatenly lie about how many times he came, I counted 3, he also refused to take our order the 1st 2 times because he was too busy and noe he was blaming us, the customer, for his screw ups. That's when I went to the bathroom and requested a different server come to our table from the 2 hostesses. When I returned the manager showed up, we told her what happened and she pretty much covered up for his behavior and made no apologies for the bad service. In other words she did nothing other than offering us more silver ware which we didn't need. After she left we had multiple people bring our entrees but David came back at the end just in time to get his tip. While we were getting ready to pay he made a poor attempt at an apology by blaming his bad performance on the 2 hostesses. He said they had sat him 5 tables at once and he couldn't take care of all of us. I don't know if that was true or not but he did lie when he said our section was the only section he was working because I saw him outside serving tables more than in our section which was inside. Considering there were several servers just hanging out and no one offering to help him with tables including management was very odd. He also said we were only the 5th table he served since 11am which made no sense either. Last but not least we paid our bill with a $50 gift card + credit but left a $20 tip in cash because we always tip well. He would not let us pay with cash either and told us our new $50 gift card was only worth $35 although it had never been used. We never got the card back from him either. At this point our group of 5 got horrible service, was blamed for such service, received little to no apology, was insulted throughout the whole experience and short changed in the bill. It is clear this location has serious management problems and we will not be returning.",90802

Seems we like to come here to relax, enjoy good food and celebrate our birthdays. We were greeted by a hostess and seated right away. Our server, Michael (I think that was his name) passed by and introduced himself, shortly after he took our drink order. It was a Wednesday night so it wasn't too busy but it wasn't super quite either. It was just right. Before our food came all the lights were dimmed and candles at each table were lighted. Very romantic. We ordered 2 Dan Dan noodles (they mix in front of your table), shrimp with the honey dew melon, and orange chicken, all which were delicious. It was perfect for 5 people. Overall drinks were good, food was good and the service was excellent! Thank you for the great experience, will definitely be coming back.",90802

The food was delicious! For appetizers we ordered traditional edamame, the calamari and the crispy green beans. All 3 were super good. We ordered the sesame chicken and crisp honey chicken - both were sweet but yummy. The mongolian beef and filet mignon dishes were probably my favorite. The dragon roll and wonton soup did not disappoint, and the fried rice too. I think the pad thai could use more peanuts but it was still good. :] overall great experience.

411,"340 S Pine Ave Long Beach, CA 90802",Jeff B.,"PALOS VERDES PENINSULA, CA",7/7/2018,5,"On June 25, 2018, we hosted a party of 15 people to celebrate a graduation. I initially spoke with manager Nick, then managers Tyler and Mark. I was so pleased with their eagerness to help. I was so pleased with their flexibility. I was unsure of the number of people, unsure of the exact time we'd get there, unsure of whether we'd want to sit inside or out on the patio, and probably unsure of a few other details. Can we bring in a cake and will you keep it cold? Sure. Can I bring in some balloons a few hours before the party? Sure. Of course eventually we had to decide on inside or out, the number of people, etc., but they did their best to be as flexible as possible for as long as possible. Finally it was all set. We sat outside and the sun bothered a few of us, so they worked quickly to move the umbrellas in place. Hillary was our waitress and she worked hard! She was very friendly, eager to help, and efficient. She made some suggestions, served our food order without one error (pretty good for a party of 15, with everyone ordering different appetizers, drinks and main dishes), and just helped to make this party one huge success. While I didn't taste everyone's food, I tasted the egg drop soup, the brown rice, and various main dishes. Every item that I tasted was served hot and was delicious. I'm 71 years old and I grew up on Chinese food so I know good from mediocre Chinese food. This food was definitely very good. The portions were reasonably generous. I was surprised that Hillary's tip was not included in the final bill. With such a large party, typically the tip is added on, but nope, it wasn't. I appreciate that, although I bet many servers get less than they deserve under such circumstances. We left a generous tip because Hillary was outstanding. And so were the managers that I mentioned above. This was my first experience at this particular P.F. Chang's, and obviously it won't be my last. WE'LL BE BACK. Thank you Nick, Tyler, Mark, and Hillary for making our daughter-in-law's Ph.D. graduation that much more special than it already was.",90802

This is sort of the same quality and taste of Panda Express but quite a bit more expensive. We ordered 4 dishes and a small vegetable and our bill was about 85 bucks. It's just ok so I am leaving a just ok review. The service was good. It was a very busy evening and we waited 45 minutes but everyone was polite and nice. I could not hear my server she was sooo quite but maybe my hearing is starting to go.. I don't know. We ordered:Lettuce Chicken Wrap.. it was very goiod.Crispy Honey Chicken.. it was okChicken Pad Thai. thumbs down. no bean sprouts.. no lemon.. no flavorBuddhas Feast... I asked for the tofu to be fried.. it wasn't but otherwise it was okKung pao shrimp... good but not even mild in spicinessBrown Rice ... yummyAnyway all in all I don't think I will eat here again.

They advised me that my order should be ready by 6:55p and when I pulled up at 6:45, my food was already awaiting me. I called to let them know that I was outside and the man brought my food. It was chilly outside, but he was very friendly and commented on how he liked to get out of the restaurant sometimes.  :)My food was delicious as always, so definitely no complains there. Side note...   Who knew that PF Changs had a call center?  Lol. When I called to place my order the gentleman clearly had no knowledge of the area.

But this night, oh man... our bartender was such a d**khead. He totally ignored us for like 10 minutes before his bar-back noticed that we weren't helped yet. Was it a discriminatory thing, one might wonder? I don't think so cuz he had no problem ignoring his other patrons, too! The guy was just a space cadet douche so after we got our wine from his bar-back, we opted to wait for a table instead after all! I should know by now that P.F.

Came here to celebrate a family birthday and had bad luck of having Justin as our server. I have been to this location several times for business lunches and cocktails and have never been disappointed. The service we received this time left much to be desired. First off food arrived and was served with no rice that was ordered. Had to track down Justin and asked for rice. By the time it arrived the entrees were cold. Paying $20 plus a entree you expect to enjoy it hot. My sister called Justin to refill his drink and he basically ignored her. He never asked if we were satisfied with our meals was never offered refills. He seemed like he was either overwhelmed or just rude not sure which. Spoke to the manager who gave a fake apology and we visibly watched Justin speak poorly to her busboy coworker who was a Caucasian guy with a beard who gave us dirty stares. No tips and there are way too many other choices that I'll never find myself at this location again. Corporate will also be notified of our experience.,90802

I'm a fan, so I know what I like, and I like what they serve.My thoughts on this location:- Not sure if it was a weird night, or what. Most PFC locations I've been to the service is effusive at worst. Maybe it was something in the coastal air? Who knows. They weren't rude, just not as friendly as some of the other PFCs I've been to.- Parking situation sucks. I mean, that's not really specific to PFCs but also the other restaurants. Just something to keep in mind if this is the one you choose to visit. We parked in the Pike parking structure. While it wasn't too far, I wasn't really stoked on how far we had to walk to get back. Sure, you can valet, but who the heck valets a Honda Civic for the prices they charge? I did like that bar's TVs, as well as all the other bars in the area had the Dodger game on, and it was the night they whooped ass on Matt Cain. So that was all good.",90802

I complained directly to this PF Changs location through the website and received no response. I would expect PF Changs to take action about this. I have held onto the receipt since then.

Then the meal came we had mangolian beef this was so salty almost unpalatable but mixed with rice we still were able to get it down. We also had orange chicken it was just ok I missed the batter that I am used to with orange chicken. Honestly this was my first and last time here based on the food alone!

I think mainly because we were a big group and was able to order a wide variety. We had the lettuce wrap and fried green beans for an appetizer, for entree we had honey chicken, stir fried spinach, kung pao chicken, spicy shrimp, crab fried rice, we had white rice and brown rice, spicy chicken for dessert we had New York style cheese cake, fried bananas with coconut ice cream and flourless chocolate cake. Like I said the food was a bit better, not too greasy but nothing stellar either even though they somewhat updated their menu.The service was spotty that they had several birthday parties including us.

Joke was on us!  She brought out a bare plate with carmel swirls and 3 candles, no dessert on it, just candles stuck to the plate.  She said we could eat the caramel, sorry.  Never have I seen anything like it.  The chef and waitress were obviously laughing at us.  Shame on you PF Chang's Long Beach, we will never be back and I will tell this story FOREVER!TOP IT OFF WHEN WE GAVE THE WAITRESS A $50 GIFT CARD ALONG WITH OUR AMEX, SHE CAME BACK AND SAID, ""GOOD NEWS, IT WENT THROUGH"".  WTF?  BAD FOOD, BAD SERVICEI WOULD RECOMMEND JUST ABOUT ANY RESTAURANT OVER THIS ONE.",90802

Chang's a few times before, though it had been a while.  The previous visits were to other locations, but all were pretty consistently the same in decor and food.  I have never really been impressed with the offerings of PF Chang's but this recent visit served to further solidify that unimpressed impression.My wife and I went this time with a group of her colleagues and their significant others.  In total, there were 12 of us with 8pm reservations.  At this location, you have to either valet, get really lucky with metered parking, or walk an eternity and still pay for structured self parking.  Really, valet with validation was the best deal when it was all said and done, but still it's annoying.We got some drinks outside under the heat lamps while we waited for our tables to be ready.  It was probably around 20 minutes after that we were finally seated.  It took another 15 minutes for our group to come to some sort of consensus on what to order.  We ended up getting a lot of dishes with the intent of passing them around and doing a ""family-style"" meal.  Most were recommendations by the server and in general, they were good quality and tasty, but not mind blowing.Some of the dishes we got included a chow mein with multiple meats, a shrimp in garlic sauce, kung pao chicken, mongolian beef, shrimp with some kind of egg stuff, rice, orange chicken, and some others.  The total bill with a drink per person was around $360 total with gratuity built in.  $30/person is certainly not that cheap by any means, but that's the price of group dining I suppose.Summary: Great service.  Good food.  Reasonable prices. Parking is either valet or a long walk.  The food doesn't wow me, but it is not bad by any means, either.  The quality is solid at least (which is often not the case for Chinese).  There are other places in the area I'd rather eat, but for a group dinner it's a decent option.",90802

I'll stick to pei Wei from now on. Parking is a bitch. If you don't valet you have to park at least a block away, and valet charges $6 for up to an hour.

Customer Service, great, but not the best because it was not memorable. Food... Ok so entrees here are a bit overpriced for the portions that are served. The most recent visit we ordered quite a few dishes as there were about 14 in our party. I would have to say that the mango chicken dish was my favorite. A bit spicy (just a warning for those who don't like spicy) but I love spicy! The other entrees that were on the table were not the best nor were they my fav. Ok so now on to my favorite part of the entire meal.... The deep fried banana dessert. Oh my GOODNESS!! Can you say heaven?! Drizzled with honey and served with vanilla ice cream and fresh raspberries. WOW!  The right amount of sweet, because I do not like things that are way too sweet, I think its an overkill. This dessert is a must, that is if you have a sweet tooth like me. Sometimes if we eat at Yardhouse just down the way, I make the extra stop here before heading home just to take this dessert to go. Fatty of me... yes! but who cares when I'm eating this yummy piece of heaven! I do come sit down to eat here about once every 5 months even though it's not at the top of my Chinese go-to's, but mainly because of it's prime location and it's ultra yummy dessert.

Our waitress/bartender did not come to check if we needed more drinks...I had to ask the barback for a refill on my ice tea. I also asked our waitress about the new lobster and shrimp fried rice. She said it was good. It was NOT. It tasted like it was burnt...had an after taste to it. I was dissapointed.

The way that the manager approached us was compleatly wrong, asking if everything was ok, I answered yes ofcourse, she replied by stating oh because there are some complaints about the noise your kids are making.. Their was 4 more families with children around us, but I did not see her talking to them.. my 3 year old has a high pitch scream, the manager did not even give me time to distract her, in less then 5 min she came back with the same statement. The other children were also about the same age and crying or screaming in s high pitch. At that moment I just asked for the bill, and left.. not before telling  her that we had requested to sit away from the center of the restaurant, and if they did not want kids to put a sign out side..this happened not at dinner time but at 230 in the afternoon..",90802

On top of that we wait more than an hour for our food. My sister has a peanut allergy and we specifically asked for no peanuts in the pad thai and what did we get...A PEANUT and a hair in the Mongolian beef. Only a few of us got rice bowls and this server said she was coming back and she never did...she wasnt even our server to begin with which was weird. Our original server was pretty nice though but he disappeared for awhile. The manager wasn't that helpful either. The portion sizes are not worth the price! The taste was alright. I suggest you take your hard earned money else where.

When we were seated, she took our order right away. Our food came out within 15 minutes, which is extremely fast for a busy restaurant. Everything was cooked to perfection. We had the green beans, Mongolian beef and orange peel chicken. I also ordered a drink, Kamikaze on the rocks w/ salt on the rim and even that was made to perfection. You may ask, ""how does someone not make that drink right?"" But trust me, I've been places where it has happened. Overall, it was one of the best dining experiences I have had at P.F. Changs.

Its the kind of place that you want to really like.. cool décor, fun area at the Pike, good friends.. all the necessary elements. But it is a less than satisfying experience. Three chicks on an all-girl weekend. Sat at the bar around 6:30 on Saturday. Not that crowded all night as far as the bar went. Bar staff was excellent! The food, not so much. Hot sour soup was very beef brothy, and bitter in a bad way. We didn't finish it. Fried green beans - always awesome!  Lettuce wraps, they were okay. I think they have run their course as far as excitement! We ordered kung pao chicken and double fried noodles to share. Lets start with Mr. Kung Pao - no pao here. No flavor at all. If this is their spiciest dish, they could cater a Leisure World event. The chicken was barely tossed with some peppers and peanuts, no veggies NO sauce. This was a complete disappointment. They are not cooking in that kitchen. They are throwing 5 ingredients on a plate and calling it an entrée. Its really a shame. The double noodles were okay, but dry. Seriously, go for the pretty décor, but you will have a far better chance at getting a good Chinese / Asian meal at the little take out place around the corner for your house (regardless of where you live!)

I have been to other PF Changs and the food and the service were amazing. We had a great waiter and some of the food was very good and that's why I gave 3 stars. However ..... the table stand outside next to the dining tables had a huge amount of dust.  Any restaurant or business located next to or even near the beach for more than a few months knows that you absolutely must dust every single day. The table next to dining tables did not look like it had been dust in a few days at least. I absolutely  do not recommend the calamari because it was really salty. I ordered the sauteed spinach and garlic but barely tasted any garlic. The mint cocktail I ordered was so strong without any kind of cocktail mint flavor that I wished I had ordered a rum and coke.  Little things could have made this experience a lot better thankfully the waiter was nice and did his best but I probably won't be returning to this PF Changs,90802

The green beans tasted stale, almost like they have been sitting for awhile. They were not crunchy like they normally are. Lastly, the fried rice was super bland. Like someone forgot to put soy sauce or any other seasoning on it. Overall, the food was okay but the service was great. Price wise, it's a little expensive for Americanized Chinese food but they do offer a lot of gluten free options. I did use my Amex cash back reward for $10 off a purchase of $40.

Since we were sharing, our server Brittany made sure to inform us of everything that had onions in it and asked the chefs if they could alter some of the recipes to exclude the onions. When this wasn't possible because some of the items (ie sauces and salads) are pre-made, she had a menu printed out of all of the items that didn't include onions in the recipes. I thought this was awesome because she didn't just go ""you can't eat that sorry."" She made it really easy for my Godmother to choose something to eat.

The best time to come here and it's relatively quiet is mid-afternoon after 2:00 on a weekday.The best thing from P.F. Chang's has to be the lettuce wraps. I first tried them at the P.F. Chang's location in the Irvine Spectrum where I dined with several co-workers. I could just have this as my main course and I'd be happy. :-)My favorite entrees are the crispy honey chicken, orange peel chicken, Mongolian beef, orange peel beef and beef and broccoli. Another item I REALLY love is the Chang's spare ribs. I don't know what kind of barbecue sauce they use, but it's sweet and I could probably drink it straight! :-DIf you're too full for a full-sized dessert, there are ""mini"" portions available. I've had the red velvet cake mini and the triple chocolate mousse mini, both of which are excellent. Another dessert I've had which I thought was really good was the banana spring rolls, which reminded me of Filipino turon (banana fritters) topped with ice cream and drizzled with vanilla and caramel sauces.As you can imagine, lunch prices are less than dinner prices. For lunch, entrees ordered a la carte will be more expensive.The service here each time I've come here has been very good to excellent, depending on the day and who's on duty.The parking here is less than ideal (valet or park near the Aquarium and walk). Also, being that this restaurant is in downtown Long Beach, you may encounter the occasional panhandler or homeless person. I just turn the tables and ask THEM if they have any change! Their expressions alone after asking them is worth the price of valet parking. ;-)",90802

I spoke to PF ChangManager and ask them if they could call someone. They called the parking company manager who said they would be coming out to the valet table. They never did. If you leave here do not have valet park. They don't except credit cards for the parking cash only they have a convenient ATM right next to the table with charges $2.75 to withdraw money.

The sesame chicken was decent and the portion was okay too. There was a little too much sauce but it wasn't a big deal since I had rice to eat with it. The avocado lobster roll came in small pieces and didn't have too much flavor. Lastly the lobster fried rice was nice but I rather they not batter the lobster meat.

Those haven't been cleaned in weeks. The cleanliness items had me a bit put off right off the bat. Understand; I am not an uppity neat freak, this stuff was dirty.

It was downright bland. There was NO sauce on this stuff. I got the impression that there is a bag of pre-cooked chicken sitting next to a bag of peanuts and a bowl of peppers. Mix these up on a plate, nuke and serve. Not good for a restaurant of this caliber.I see no need to come back here until they do a deep cleaning and start giving a crap what is served tot he customer.On a side note, my body couldn't have rejected this stuff faster. i was lucky to have made it home.If you are considering this restaurant, rethink it or inspect it before you sit down.DisappointedE",90802

It's simply a genre of food that everyone knows and can easily fall in love with! For the price of PF Changs, the restaurant itself doesn't do much to stand out in the crowd! It's a slight step up from Panda Express. The spicy chicken on the menu is not spicy at all, so I'm not sure it makes sense from a marketing perspective  to have it advertised as such. The fried rice is nothing to write home about, I can name a handful of spots that are 2x the quality and 1/2 the price in Monterey Park or Los Angeles. This definitely did not win me over, the only things that saved this mediocre experience was the service, a nibble from The Lemon Chicken Grass Salad my girlfriend had, Strawberry CuCumber Limeade, and the great fortune that I received from my fortune cookie.

This rung VERY true at this PF Chang's. We had a party of 9, which really wasn't that hard. The server was really checked out and unable to answer any questions we had about the menu. She was super UNaccommodating, didn't check in with us, and it took FOREVER for the staff to clean up our table/dishes. But the food was PHENOM and the price was INCOMPARABLE. Hence the 3 stars. Eventually the manager came over to talk to us to apologize, I think. Well not for the awful service but because they missed one of our dishes.

We had made reservations prior which was great. When we arrived they sat us promptly staff was very nice. We sit and order drinks and appetizers (3 orders of lettuce wraps) we then order our dinner about 5-10 after. We were enjoying ourselves and a different server comes with what we thought were our lettuce wraps but when he (food runner)sets the tray down  it was our dinner.  The food runner then stands in one place behind my 4 yr old daughter to hand everyone their plates. Which was very rude because at one point he reaches over the table to hand a plate and says"" oh it's hot be careful"" but proceeds to hand the plate to my aunt. After he handed all the plates out he leaves. Our server Mandy comes we tell her we never received our appetizers she apologizes then brings one out in the middle of our dinner when we said we were ok. My 4yr daughter tells me she feels something in her hair. I have her get up to come to me and the whole back of her dress(white) had orange sauce down the entire back as well at her hair. The food runner spilled down my daughters back while he was standing in one place to serve us. He is very lucky that wasn't the hot plate of food down her back! We tell our serve she has no clue what to say. She has the manger come over and he apologizes and asks us if we want her to take something off the bill! We say no that's not why we are complaining. He then leaves  our servers comes back and says ""tell me what you want me to take off your bill we feel so bad!""  First it's not our job to tell you what you should do. Second don't make us feel like we are complaining just to get a free meal. So we tell her no we are good we just want out check. She then brings 20 fortune cookies over and puts 10 of them in my daughters lap. Very odd. The check comes and there were no coma applied. Yes I know that's what we didn't want but I have worked as server for many many years and my manager would never let a family go home with out them being fully happy. It was very odd. I will never come back to this place again! My 4 yr old was so embarrassed and sad that her brand new dress was ruined.  Food was good but that was pretty much it. Please see attached pics of dress.

So I drive around and come back- $2 an hour self park, this is perfect for me. I ask the guy if theres an atm because it doesnt look like his little kiosk takes cards- he points behing him- literally behind him is a little 4ft atm- I really appreciate this.I park wait for my client and she shows up at 1:03, we get a table and she looks at the menu for a long time, but thats because she didnt look at the menu online before the appointment like I did...OUr waiter seems patronizing, like an actor in a bad christian movie over acts- this guy was over waitoring or serving as it were. ""ooooooh...okay- I guess I will give you more time"" just a lot of that- don't get me wrong he was a decent waiter in terms of service.I ordered the salmon, but where my plan falls apart is the decadent hot and sour soup- this came to the table like a steaming bowl of syrup and sugar (two of the elfs seven food groups)- it was delicious and I kept telling myself each bite was the last one, until it was all the way gone...I don't ever come to Long Beach but this was actually a cool spot and a decent deal-our lunch came to 20.07 and I ordered the most expensive item on the menu (a lousy little piece of salmon).",90802

(spit spit *from waaaaay back in the throat* spit spat)The food has become consistently -- bad. And by bad I mean hurl, gag, heave, retch, spew, etc.I must say that the only items left on the menu that are remotely edible would be the chicken lettuce wraps and the fortune cookie.Other than that, stay clear from everything else. I ordered the Cashew and Almond Chicken. The soy sauce was so slimy and overpowering, that I couldn't enjoy the dish. I think the steamed rice had a more savory taste than the chicken itself.The Hot and Sour soup -- same deal. Thick and slimy with too much crap floating inside. Sure, I ate it, but I'm not saying it was yummy in my tummy. The Peppered Steak was soooo wrong. It tasted like the cook went heavy on the salt, forgot he put salt in the dish, so he added more, then accidentally dropped an entire Morton's Salt container inside the dish and served it to us. We sent that back pronto. She returned with the Crispy Honey Chicken. This time, the sweet sauce over the chicken was odd tasting. I thought it tasted like old left over Chinese takeout.The rest was a collaboration of our waitress' forgetfulness, her clumsiness, and her absentmindedness. I am saddened by the downward spiral PFC food quality has taken...a total nose dive into my list of crappy restaurants in Long Beach.",90802

When I paused a little after he made [that] suggestion he said ""we can go somewhere else"". He told me he'd already read my Yelp review from June and so I relented; we only get to see each other once month and, I wanted to give him his Christmas Gift. We were seated directly across from the table where I sat the last time I was here ( now we're already off to a shaky start ) and, it was next to the window looking out toward the Aquarium. We started off with those famous Lettuce Wraps and I must say they weren't bad but, I would have used Romaine Lettuce. Then, we place our drink orders an Absolute/7 for my friend and, a Ginger Beer on Draught for moi. My friend ordered The Beef Fried Rice and I opted for The Orange Peel Beef; our server ( who was great by the way ) mixed our sauces for us and then........the air conditioning came on. Look, I'm a Polar Bear and unless it's raining I've got at least one window open in my place and, all 4 down in the car; this AC was so cold I was shivering as I looked up and saw the angled vents next to the ceiling that were blowing the at least 66 degree Clipper Winds onto me. Also, I noticed that the ceiling had the standard intake and vented AC vents ( so why the Arctic Freeze? ) When my meal arrived it was cold within 5 minutes due to the AC; no, I didn't say anything because I was not in the mood to get into a dialogue with a manager about how they need to be that way ( Also, I could heat it up later ) trust me it's happened before. Besides, if I'm gonna pay $13.95 for this piddly portion of food I might as well eat it cold as to not at all. I just wasn't in my Homo-Bitch Mode at all either ( That bump up from 1mg. of Clonapin to 2 mg. must finally be working ). Guess what it's Christmas and if that's the worst that will happen to me for the rest of the year I'm not in bad shape at all; I got to spend a great 3 hours with my friend ( who made me his delish homemade chunk-o-chip cookies ), another mutual friend showed up and joined us for a while too; what a nice suprise :-).BTW, the parking [STILL] Sucks! $6.00 for valet with validation Oh Paleeeeeeeze!",90802

Why did I agree to go to PF Chang's on a Friday night?First off, parking is terrible. You either pay $15 or some ridiculous valet fee to park within a couple yards of your destination or pay $whatever amount to park half a mile away in the Aquarium's parking structure.Secondly, I'm fully aware that PF isn't real Chinese food. I don't much care about that if I'm going to be paying more than $10 for it, because I expect there to be something different than what I could get at Pei Wei, which is another place I dislike. Oops. Did I give it away?The wait was shitty. Almost an hour? Good thing I'm patient. The service was good considering the place was PACKED. It must be the hot spot pre-V20. I almost threw up in my mouth a little. Our server was very understanding, patient and apologetic for the craziness (namely, the loud family affair that was a bachelorette party with the bachelorette + attendees' kids in tow) on the patio. But the food was beyond saving. I was starving and could barely get through half of my plate because of the salt shaker that had been emptied onto it. Everything basically tasted like what you could get at Pei Wei, but more expensive. The only saving graces of the meal were the X-Rated drinks and the dessert, but the former was a weak mixed drink and the latter was in a tiny, slender shotglass so they can only barely be mentioned.The bill was too high to be justified, and I can't even justify giving it three stars.

Makes me wonder how ""rinsed off"" the other dishes are. This is actually the first time i went there and there wasn't an hour wait (at least) but i did go at 5 on a Saturday.  The server had to be high, or something, he definitely wasn't all there.  He didn't seem to understand why i wanted a new glass of water and took about 20 minutes to get me a new one.The first PF Chang's i went to was in vegas, when i was drunk, immediately after I won $40 on a free slot pull, so i can imagine why i liked it so much then. I went back for the Mongolian beef, which was delicious. Everything else was a disappointment. I told the group of people with me ""dont order too much, the portions are huge and you can share them. Apparently i was drunker than i thought at the location in vegas because we got our dishes and it was less food than a $4 serving at panda express.

Chang's maybe three times & all those times I've been dissapointed.  Honey chicken does not pair well with white rice.  The seasoning for their veggie lettuce wraps were too salty.  I admit, their Egg Drop soup is quite good.  Yes, they do not have your traditonal American salt & pepper but instead chili sauce, soy sauce & another I forget.  Aside from admiring the copy statues of the Terra Cotta Army soildiers, there is nothing I enjoy @ this restuarant.  Right, whose to say what is authentic or not?  The line is blurry.  But what I can say is what is good ""Chinese"" food and what is bad ""Chinese"" food, imitation or not.  The best indicator of all is by looking at how many Chinese people (or Asian people since some nationalities are difficult to distinguish) are in the P.F.

They have really big portions and the price is not bad at all. They now have a dinner for 2 menu. It includes an app for the two to share, soup for each of you, which is delicious, your entrees, and a desert. Each person get to pick their own entree and the selection is good. The portion for one person is usually ok to split between the 2 of you. There is always food to take home. The deserts are perfect! They are called mini deserts and come in a bunch of flavors. They have a tiramisu, carrot cake, red velvet, double chocolate, and a few others. They are small but they are just enough. They are not overbearing and thats a good thing! The decor is nice. I have been seated inside and outside. Being outside at sunset makes for a very nice dinner! They have warmers outside to keep the chill away while you watch the water from our table. inside the lights are very dim and the booths are very personal. they are huge for one thing, and they allow a more personal experience. I will always make this place my first choice! I recommend it to everyone!",90802

Once we were seated my sister ordered some appetizers to get us started. The calamari was delicious and the fried green beans had a nice crunch to them. Our food came out relatively quickly considering how busy it was. We had a few great dishes including the classic Orange Chicken, Walnut Shrimp with Melon, Lemon Chicken, and a few others. The shrimp with melon was particularly interesting. It tasted like it had a sweet milk reduction over it which really complimented the melon balls. Our server was very friendly. I wish I had gotten her name so I could put a good word out for her. All in all it was a wonderful experience, as well as the price for our meal was great considering there were 8 of us.

Then we opted for the asparagus (large, ample portion) and kung pao chicken (white and brown rice).  The Kung Pao at PF's is like crack.   I nearly ate the entire plate by myself.  Very spicy. The rice they serve with all main dishes is ample portion and, even though I'm not  a huge brown rice fan, I think the brown rice here is hearty and dee-lish.  I just can't figure out why Yelpers are ripping on the food.   Special disclaimer:  only been here for lunch, never for dinner.   Perhaps the service is marginal at night?

Chang's.  As I understand, he knew a really great Chinese chef named Chang who had amazing recipes and wanted to open a restaurant with him.  Once they finally agreed, P.F. Chang's was born.  The ""P.F."" stands for Paul Fleming, and the rest is pretty obvious.  I of course love their Lettuce Wraps.  I also love their Better Lemon Chicken, Orange Peel Beef, and Szechuan asparagus.  I like that you make your own dipping sauces with chili oil, rice vinegar, and soy sauce along with hot pepper paste and spicy mustard.The decor is stunning!  The lighting is perfect and there are many different seating arrangements depending upon your preference of a table or booth.  The outdoor seating is not quite as inviting as I think they could make it, but it's not the focal point of the space.  Even the bar is very comfortable to sit and eat dinner if you want to dine alone or watch a game.My only problem is that I love the dishes I listed above so much that it is hard for me to try something new.  Oh well, if it's not broken, why try to fix it, right?",90802

Okay, we get it.  You're epicurean elite and the silly American masses don't understand what real Chinese food tastes like. It's a chain. Knowing that going in and expecting  gastronomical enlightenment is just silly. That being said, this isn't one of my favorite places by any stretch.  It seems like whenever I go out with a group, we end up at these kinds of places. However, the food is decent and I can't say I've ever gotten indigestion from eating the food, which is saying a lot. I ordered a Plum Collins which is made with plum vodka and plum wine was nice. My friend ordered the same thing and said she had a little bit of buzz, but I could have gotten the same buzz from a coke. We ordered a bunch of different things-mongolian beef, honey crispy chicken, mushu chicken, shrimp and snap peas. Everyone agreed the beef was tender.  I didn't try the mushu chicken, but no one in the group seemed too crazy about it. I don't get the lettuce wraps things. First of all, iceberg lettuce? Ew. Apparently, the lettuce wraps are very popular at this place.  The waitress seemed nice, but I think it was because the lone male at our table was engaging her in conversation. Just looking around, I can tell this location has surlier, edgier staff than the one in Pasadena. However, the waitress that brought our drinks to the patio seemed sweet and upbeat.I know that I'll end up here again, so I've just learned to order the simplest things from the menu and the enjoy the company of good friends.",90802

That said, this location lacks in many respects. First, let's talk about the parking situation. Unfortunately for this PF Changs, it is located in what I feel is a very undesirable location that only tourists go to when they're visiting long beach. There is no free lot for PF changs, and while there is a self-parking lot, I think they manipulate it so that the ""full"" sign is always out, forcing people to pay $6 for Valet. That's with validation. Completely lame. If the parking was better in this area, I'd be more apt to patron places like PF Changs, Gladstones, and Yard House. It's just too much of a hassle and a waste of money to pay for parking when I can avoid doing so at dozens of other restaurants in LB.Let's talk about the food: I usually order the Changs Spicy Chicken which is my go-to fav. They make it the same here as they do everywhere else, but for some reason, i feel like the portion sizes are getting smaller, yet the prices are going higher. They do have a lunch menu that offers lunch portions at about $1-3 off the dinner price for the same dish. It also comes with your choice of soup or salad. Not that bad of a deal, and you get a reasonable portion for the price. Except if you order the lo mein lunch dish, which costs $9.99 whether you order it off the lunch or the dinner menu, except the dinner portion is bigger. Wtf? Ridiculous.I ordered the lo mein today and it was generally good, except the vegetables were pathetic. The snap peas were undercooked and pretty raw, and had a very chemical aftertaste to them. guess they're not organic. There were also huge chunks of broccoli. I've really never seen broccoli in my lo mein, but don't mind it, just wish they weren't the size of a tennis ball? The service is pretty decent here, hit or miss depending on your server.

The restaurant has a spectacular view of the Aquarium and the Harbor, and they have both indoor and outdoor patio seating.My clients and I opted to sit outside since it was a nice sunny day, and after repositioning the patio umbrellas we were able to relax without getting scorched in the sun.Our waitress was nice, but seemed extremely busy with other tables, so the service was a bit slow, however she was quick to correct an error by removing the charge for one of the lunches.I started with Hot & Sour soup and then we each ordered full-sized dinners so that we could share family-style and taste a little bit of everything. I selected the Chang's Spicy Chicken which was diced chicken breast lightly dusted and stir-fried with a tangy sauce of sweet and spice. Not too spicy, but plenty delicious.My friends ordered Lemon Chicken, Mongolian Beef, and Sweet & Sour Pork. The dishes all came with either white or brown rice, and we were able to make up our own version of combo plates from the different meals. The sauce for the Lemon Chicken tasted a bit off - I described it as ""soapy"", and we all agreed that it just didn't taste right.

Stop coming by every five minutes and asking ""are you ready yet, are you ready to order yet""? I like this place but it is becoming very fast food. Hurry and eat your food and get out so we can open this table. When I spend this much money, back off and let me enjoy my food.

613,"340 S Pine Ave Long Beach, CA 90802",Toni L.,"Sugar Land, TX",3/30/2011,3,"You've got to be curious about this place if you like Chinese food at all. Is it authentic? My answer to that is yes with many, many caveats. Read on. Food:  My boo and I got the prix fixe menu for two which includes soup, three entrees, rice (yelp.com/biz_photos/CEKy…), and a dessert. Our selections included hot and sour soup (yelp.com/biz_photos/CEKy…), egg drop soup (yelp.com/biz_photos/CEKy…), Chang's chicken lettuce wraps (yelp.com/biz_photos/CEKy…), Chang's spicy chicken (yelp.com/biz_photos/CEKy…), honey chicken (, the red velvet desert mini (yelp.com/biz_photos/CEKy…), and the raspberry cheesecake dessert mini (yelp.com/biz_photos/CEKy…). Everything was pretty good and tasted like something you'd get in any Chinese restaurant. I really liked the lettuce cups, but I think I prefer the Cantonese squab version. Also, the desserts were delish, but they could have been a little larger. The meal was pretty expensive and we only had a miniscule amount leftover. Is it worth the price? Depends on how much cash you have floating around. Atmosphere: This is the only advantage Chang's has over your run of the mill Chinese joint. The interior is decorated with rich paintings and some funky lighting. Everything is a lot cleaner and more spacious. It's like the Cheesecake factory with an Asian twist.  Service: Sort of slow, but ok. Synopsis: If you have the extra cash to blow, the food is pretty good. That said, you can get the same stuff in almost any Chinese restaurant for a fraction of the price. I love SGV.",90802

615,"340 S Pine Ave Long Beach, CA 90802",Kevin L.,"San Luis Obispo, CA",12/31/2013,5,"My family and I came in on Christmas Eve for dinner after spending a lackluster evening across the bay at the Queen Mary: CHILL. We waited maybe 30 minutes.Right off the bat, we ordered our appetizers: chicken lettuce wraps and Korean chicken wings. The wraps were good as usual and should be ordered every time. the chicken wings were awesome, way better than I expected. Not super spicy, these wings are full of Asian flavor and the crust on the outside stayed crispy. I'd definitely order these again.To share, we ordered the Dan Dan Noodles, the Almond & Cashew Chicken, the Shaking Beef, and the Ma Po tofu. I usually get the Dan Dan Noodles, and they never disappoint. Garlicky and not super spicy, these tender noodles are a table pleaser. The Almond & Cashew chicken was good. It wouldn't have been my first choice, but it's a default parent-pleaser that did it's job. It was pretty good. The Shaking Beef wasn't popular at all. There was something off about it, a fishy taste with no fish in sight. We definitely won't order it again. Finally, the Ma Po Tofu: the surprise hit of the night. My brother and I love tofu so we knew we'd like it. However, we weren't expecting our parents to love it and they did. This crispy fried tofu tastes more like fried cheese, crispy on the outside, soft and melty on the inside. The sauce it was in was incredible as well. I ate the leftovers two days later and it was still good. I would absolutely order this again.Our server, who's name escapes me, was great. He was attentive and friendly but not obviously faking it (take it from someone who faked it often at Starbucks and Disneyland).",90802

I really like chinese food but since i came to know that they use chicken broth in vegetable dishes I have stopped going to fast food chinese places but this was bistro and I asked the server too and i believed her.Being a vegetarian is hard sometimes so I try to taste and develop my taste for pretty much every cuisine here.

I have a soy allergy and normally I can always eat sushi because it's just fish, rice, avocado and sea weed. They have rolls on their menu, but said I couldn't eat any of them because of the soy. So I asked if I could get just a roll with fresh like salmon and avocado and the manager (Sierra) says she doesn't know if anything is fresh or if they can even accommodate which I find crazy when they have fresh fish. This experience with a manager was by far the worst I have ever had in my life. Sierra not only didn't try to help me and my soy allergy at all, she never even came back to the table to assist the matter after I asked multiple times. But that's not even the worst part. I finally get my sushi they attempted to make and it was wet like the whole roll was washed under water AND I find a foreign object in my sushi. It looked like some type of bone. So obviously when I see this I ask again for the manager (who never came back from the first time) and once sierra got there she couldn't have been more rude. She grab my plate and started picking at it right in front of me. And was like hmmm what is that.. Let me go ask the cook what it is. I'm like wtf I don't give a shit what it is!!! I just want my money back. And she asked like I was tying to be all cheap for saying that and gave me a dirty look before walking away and agreeing. Like really what did you expect me to ask for? I never write few views and I never think anyone does a poor enough job to deserve to be put down for what they do at work, but the manager Sierra at PF Changs Long Beach needs to be seriously let go. The lack of care shows she obviously has her focus elsewhere so let her go please. I will not ever be back here.",90802

First off I did not care for the Valet only parking . We don't mind valet but an option to self park certainly makes sense. Self parking should be widely available with proper signage prior to pulling into he parking lot and feeling as if we ""have to"" VALET...Secondly, we were seated outside which would've been wonderful had w been able to see our surounding a bit better. The patio area had closed down umbrellas sitting in the main walk areas which would make a loud ""clunk clunk "" sound whenever anyone walk through which was every 2 minutes or so. I would recommend that management think about placing these eyesores in another area that isn't as heavily traveled as the spot these were positioned. Next, our waitress of whom I will not ention her name was mediocre at best. She warmed up after a while but it surely took some pulling to shape her up. She even had nerve enough to bring out our nephew's bday cake candles blazing after we just ordered another 4 entrees. We felt as if she was rushing us out so she could chop up the section we were "" paying for""....(BTW-We obviously were far from ready to enjoy his ice cream cake and she was so determined to move us along that she even blazed up her own candlesof which she had to blow out to take the cake back to the freezer until we were done eating. The little manager was great. She came out and was very professional and tried her best at providing solutions. The comped the 3 string beans we ordered and gave a couple free appetizer coupons. Thanks!!I would really suggest that PF CHANGS fin a way to better accomodate larger parties because the entrees are a bit pricey to be soo small. Good tasting food but we could have hit the asian buffet off the 405 and cherry and done mush better. There you have it..Overall look at this Chang, just ok.. Peace",90802

626,"340 S Pine Ave Long Beach, CA 90802",Margie F.,"Fountain Valley, CA",10/16/2016,3,"While waiting for our desert to arrive last night, a group of three children and 2 wine. Were seated in a booth nearby. It was approximately 10:00. These children were screaming at the top of their lungs. The two little girls possibly 18 months old were out of the booth on the floor shoving and screaming at eat other. The parents did nothing. My husband approached the manager who proceeded to tell him that it was ""illegal, against the law to say anything. How PC have we become? You can ruin my dinner and nothing can be done about it. We had our desert packed to go. As we walked by their table, I suggested that they have their children get back in their seats as it was dangerous for them and the wait staff trying to serve the other patrons. Of course, I was told to mind my own business was and not tell them how to raise their children. They called me an old white woman and that I should go home, it was too late for me to be up! Is it really the approach that management takes to let one group ruin the evening of many others. I am certain a trained employee could have suggested they stay in their seats or they would have to leave! The food was good, our waiter, Matt, was terrific, but the ambiance was terrible. Will never go back! Well behaved children should always be welcomed, but I'll behaved children and their parents should be asked to leave. It's just that simple!",90802

Thankfully the organizer had reservations and we sat down right away.  The place was crowded, as usual, it was very loud. We had about 10 people in our group and we could not hear or converse with the people at the other end due to the loudness.The food was good, but I would not say great. I can't really tell the difference between this food and the food at a regular Chinese (fast food style, i.e. Chen's) restaurant.  The group that I was with is not overly adventurous on the food selection, so we had a lot of the more common dishes, like orange chicken, and some kind of ginger chiken. I did try the curry lamb dish - although to be honest, I really don't think that it was lamb that I was served. I like lamb and have eaten it plenty of times, and I did not get any of the lamb like taste in the meat at all. Makes me wonder....They have a new thing in terms of desserts, offering smaller tastings of various flavors, at $2.00 a pop. I think this is a good idea given that you sometimes want just a bite of sweetness and not another huge intake of calories. I didn't try any but they looked good.All in all my thoughts are the same - food it good enough, but not great enough to make me crave going there, let alone wait in line outside, and then have to try to have a conversation over the loud noise.",90802

649,"340 S Pine Ave Long Beach, CA 90802",Mimi P.,"Orange, CA",6/8/2011,4,Love their dan dan noodles... I always have to get it when I'm there.. generous portions and delicious flavors.. It was a great Saturday afternoon to be sitting outside and enjoying the whether as well as HH on the weekend.. They have small tapas of dim sum places with 3 pieces..prices ranging from $3-6...good for sharing and trying different flavors..We tried the pork and eggs shumai..and it was good.. We also got the lettuce wrap and it was just okay..We could've done without..there wasn't anything special about it..just chicken and lettuce...,90802
650,"340 S Pine Ave Long Beach, CA 90802",Matt _.,"Long Beach, CA",9/21/2008,3,"This is NOT authentic chinese food. This is your upscale, American-ized chinese food with a twist.With that said...yes, the place is expensive. Appetizer, main course, and dessert can run up to almost $50 for two people.We started out with the chicken lettuce wraps which are really good! Our waitress mixed our sauce for us, which is a nice touch. The sauce isn't just for the lettuce wraps, however, and can taste great with the rice or other entrees.Main course consisted of double-pan fried noodles and glazed honey shrimp. Both were really good, although the noodles were too drenched in the sauce...too salty. But definitely get the honey shrimp!Dessert ended with an amazing ice cream with four little fried bananas with fruits on all four corners of the plate. A good choice to end the meal.Our service was great. I've been here at least 5 times and only had one bad experience (it was a friday night and our waiter had to juggle large parties and families around us).I recommend this place for dates, a nice late afternoon dinner, or to get a whole new taste of what Chinese food can be.",90802

The waiter promptly arrived and I ordered Chang's Spicy Chicken...my friend ordered Grilled Salmon. Food arrived in a reasonable amount of time. My dish arrived with with a huge hunk of iceberg lettuce and what appeared to be some sort of ground up looking meat. After several bites I called the waiter over and asked ""what is this?"" His response ""Lettuce Wraps"". I repeated what I had ordered and he quickly wisked it away. Ok so my Chang's Spicy Chicken finally arrived while my friend had almost finished her meal. The first piece of chicken I chewed had an odd texture so I discretely spit it in a paper napkin. The next piece the same texture...again I spit it out. My friend asked me what was wrong and I said the chicken is raw. She proceeded to cut one open and agreed with me...ewe raw undercooked chicken. Appetite gone. I flagged the waiter again and told him my dish was inedible. It was taken away with an apology. Within a few minutes a manager appeared and informed me the entire meal was at no charge. We were offered anything else we wanted...another dish or desert. By that time all I wanted to do was leave and go find a hamburger. Very disappointed and will not return to this location.",90802

It was my second time going to PF Changs and I've had good experiences overall. The bar was full so only a fourth, in our party of eleven, were able to find a seat. I recommend, for big groups, to all get one item and share amongst each other. That saves everyone money. We got an assortment of different food, but the spicy food isn't that spicy to my relief. The food goes great with Asahi Extra Dry Japanese beer and my girlfriend got the Lucky Cat Martini. The martini was awesome, it had pineapple juice and Chambord liquor. So for people who aren't picky about what they stuff into their mouth, this is a great location to try out. Try the Shrimp with Candied Walnuts and Vegetarian Ma Po Tofu (which is tofu and broccoli). I would eat here if the occasion called for it.",90802

We walked into the bar to see if there was any seating and to our surprise there was a table! This was an especially special dinner, it was with my niece and my sister-in-law. We ordered 3 main dishes and shared them. This was my first time ever experiencing P.F. Changs and boy was I impressed. It wasn't anything like what I expected. The Chicken Lettuce Wraps are to die for! and I also loved the Shrimp in Lobster sauce. My niece kept joking that we were sitting next to a cursed date table. We witnessed 2 dates while we were there...and there were crickets chirping at the table. And at the end of both dates, the girl picked up the check while the guy roamed his head around the room. So if you happen to go there on a date, watch out for the back table in the bar seating section. It might be cursed!",90802

Tender, juicy, succulent, and savory on the inside. Goes well with rice or garlic noodles. Amazingly casual, and fun. I was looking forward to every bite!",90802

We both loved our dishes and will be coming back :-) this was our second time here at this location.We like coming here because they have a GF menu for me and the food here is yummy.The service is interesting because every server you get is different and they are either great, ok, or not so great. So far the service we have had here has be great. Though the hostess's in the front need to learn there quote timing a little better, but that was alright.Would suggest coming here for a casual dinner or a little dressy ;-) tonight we went casual but last time we went a little dressy.The Parking though don't do the Valet they have there it is horrible, but that is for the entire area not just PF Chang's.

The waitress was super friendly, super attentive, and super patient. The decor was also really pretty, not only the restaurant, but the whole Pike (I'd never been to DT Long Beach before.)That being said, minus stars for the food and the price of it. Drinks were $9 and up. Entrees were generally between $13 and $25. This would be fine if they were impressive, but they were less than okay. My coworker sent the drink she ordered back and the waitress wasn't surprised. We ordered the shrimp in lobster sauce, which tasted weird, a chicken and beef dish, which were both okay, and the honey scallops, which I thought was the best thing that we had. Also i liked the desserts in shot glasses, the mousse one was dang tasty.In the end, even though the service was good and I had a good time, our bill came out to $150 for 4 people, and they did not even accept my parking validation so I had to pay $8 for parking.

I have dined at this location as well as ordered take out online. I like this one because it is by the water with nice views. My only pet peeve with this location is the valet, expensive and the rudest bunch of guys I have ever encountered. I never bother tipping them, because they absolutely do not deserve it. Sometimes the service here can be a little slow, but nonetheless it is definitely always friendly. Ordering online is a breeze, never had any issues, and always ready at the time that you request. My favorite things here are all their rices, honey crispy chicken, Mongolian beef, and those addicting crab wontons they are the absolute best. And to my fellow yelper Suzy A, NO you are not the only one that comes just for dessert, those banana spring rolls with that creamy coconut pineapple ice cream is the best thing since sliced bread, YES it deserves a trip here all on its own.

As far as the food is concerned I was just not convinced. The appetizers were good we had the chicken lettuce wraps, but my order was eh plain I guess u can say.

I don't understand why people would want to pay so much for this stuff, when you can get at a much cheaper price, virtually anywhere. Go find a panda express or something, seriously.But okay, let me go into detail about my less than stellar experience here. First of all, I did not really ever have to intention of coming back here the last time I did go, it was for a birthday dinner, and I had gone there a few times before, and I guess it would take a birthday for me to grudgingly go back. I ordered something along the lines of lemon orange chicken or something.I don't know if it was the price, or just the taste that threw me off. But it was terrible. If this chain is going for the whole east west fusion, they really dropped the ball on this one. The whole ""umami"" concept gone completely awry, that's how I'd describe it. THat wasn't the only thing I had there mind you, I gave the lettuce wraps a shot, and that might have been the one item tolerable on that whole menu. Then someone also ordered the spicy chicken, and well, I've little interest in going into why I didn't like that either. And the lighting is very poor in there. I don't understand what kind of atmosphere they were trying to go for with the lack of light in there. So there you have it, I make it a point to not go there.",90802

Our table was against the window that looked into the kitchen so my 3 kids were amazed at the 20+ people in the kitchen doing their thing. I asked my 9 year old son if there were any Chinese people cooking and he looked over to me in shock. Another place that needs to add South American food to the menu I guess.The food was no different than other small Chinese restaurants. Maybe a little worse and not cooked by anyone Chinese. I actually think the orange chicken at Panda Express is better than the dish we ate here. The one thing I did like was the shot glass desserts for 2 dollars. A nice way to end the meal without breaking the bank.Food~ 2 stars. Would be 1 star but the dessert options were great.Service~ 3 stars. We got lucky I think.Decor~ 3 stars.

We sat in the patio area to enjoy our dinner in the beautiful 75 plus degree weather.  The patio heaters were on full blast and directly over us so we asked to have it lowered or even turned off.  One of the servers gladly lowered it and within 2 minutes the manager came and put it back on full blast.  He then walked around the patio area and greeted each table and guests yet NEVER came to our table. About to get up and leave, our server Michael pleasantly introduces himself and asked if he can start us off with drinks.  Only because of his happy energy, me and my family decide to stay.   While he got our drink order, my son who was directly under the heater had to get up to move his seat because it was unbearably hot. We asked the surrounding guest if they were ok if we turned the heat down and they were all empathetic enough to say it was ok to turn it off. (I mean it was a beautiful summer night out). Needless to say the rest of dinner was great and altogether excellent I only gave 4 stars for the food and especially our server Michael. Mr. Manager..YOU cost your business that extra star and if I didnt truly enjoy the food and the service as much as we did YOU would have only had 3 stars.  I'd really love for you to sit directly under that heater full blast for even 5 mins!!

From parking to service, 1 star is too good. We were here to celebrate my daughter's high school graduation. We had a party of 10.  To start the server provided us menus. We ordered our beverages and appetizers.   She came by and asked if we were ready to order and we kindly replied we needed a few more minutes as we were engaging in  conversation around the graduate.  Our appetizers arrived and she asked if we could give her the menus back for fear we would get food on them and get them dirty ! I looked at her dumbfounded and said seriously..... We placed our order  and the food comes with no issue. When it was time to clear the table she then asked us to pass our plates to the end as this would be quicker!! So an assembly line of dishes go from one to a another down the table. Wtf! Now its  time to cut  and serve the cake of which I had purched outside the restaurant and drop off earlier. The server brings us plastic forks in plastic with foam paper plates! Essentially the take out plates and utencils. I asked her why we weren't provided regular plates and she says ""oh it because the dish washers are busy and we are trying to ease the amount of clean up and we have a party of 20 coming in soon. I told her I dont care!  I asked to speak to the manager ( blonde gal) who says oh I will speak to her and possibly consider termination. The server comes back to our table and starts to apologize then begins to reiterate how busy they were and said she thought we were okay with it.  Grrrrrr. Finally the bill comes, nothing was taken off. Paid it because we wanted to get out of there. As we are leaving the manager at the desk asked me about my service and I proceed to tell him and he says im sorry I will speak to the general manager. Again nothing. At the very minimum a  free meal on them would have been a decent gesture considering the bill was over  $325.00",90802

Salt & Pepper calamari and spring rolls are always my favorite starters. I try to get out of ordering the same thing rut when we come here but my favorites are my favorites for a reason and I don't mind eating them every time I come. Their dishes are all pretty good from what I've had so far, except for the orange peel chicken, it's not your usual orange chicken that you get at your local Chinese take out.

I decided to stick with the already vegetarian menu that didn't list animal ingredients. I had the tempura green beans as an appetizer, and then the spicy eggplant  ($7.95) and a mapo tofu broccoli ($8.75) for dinner. Entrees have the option of white or brown rice, I of course opted for brown. All the dishes were tasty and the portion size was reasonable.  The cost of the veggie dishes was about right--- the atmosphere is very nice so you have to factor that in.  However, the meat items were $13+.  More reason to eat veg, if you ask me.  :)Although there are items for veg*ns on the menu, this chain definitely caters to meat eaters. There were huge sections of the menu just dedicated to various styles of preparing dead animals. And not one of their soups or salads was vegan. You would expect that at least one soupr or salad wouldn't contain a dead animal, but they did not.We arrived about 15 minutes early for our reservation. The restaurant was fairly empty, so I was a bit put off that they would not seat us despite having tons of available seats. After we were seated, our waitress was not attentive and when it was finally time to pack our leftovers, she was rolling her eyes at us for wanting to combine some of the dishes into one container to conserve unnecessary takeout trash instead of packing 3 separate takeout containers.

He wanted to give us a $15 dollar gift card to use ""next time"" we visited.  I told him there wouldn't be a next time and to take it off our bill.  They did not take it off our bill and looking back I shouldn't have even paid.  Especially since 15 dollars is less than anything on the menu.I can get better food at a dumpy take-away place and not have to wait an hour and a half for it.

Since I can't usually get vegetarian dumplings anywhere, I get these everytime I go to PFC.And the green beans...... mmm - spicy, garlicky, and delicious....and all the side orders come in the option of full side orders (to share) or half (for one person). My parents always get the double pan fried noodles - which are also good - and are hard to make at home, so you have to come out and get them! I think that they are one of the most popular menu items.Lunch specials are available on the weekends (!) if you are looking to save some $$ come in early and have a decent sized combo plate on the cheap. They also have a decent looking happy hour menu, but I haven't been to it so I don't actually know about all that.The kid's menu items are such a great deal - no price gouging here - a kid's plate can be had for as little as $2.95 (which makes me feel like PFC encourages, or at least welcomes, families to come here for a meal).Service is always good here and it feels like a treat to stop in here and have a bite to eat!Thanks PFC, you know I'm coming back!

This is a nicely decorated, airy and spacious dining venue with incredible views from the large wind sheltered patio and indoor bar area of the Long Beach Marina. There are plenty of Asian themed menu and beverage options to choose from at reasonable prices. I've never been disappointed with food or service. I love the side condiment tray that allows you to mix a dipping sauce to a personalized level of spiciness. Good for singles, couples and groups. Expect $35 - $40/person for an appetizer, entree, drinks and tip. One drawback is valet parking as the only option within two blocks.",90802

Changs location.  I had my hesitations about going there because the 40 person group are all nutrition professionals who are gluten free or serving gluten free clients. I was beyond impressed when Kim, one of the managers, helped to arrange a meal that was reduced in sodium and based on their gluten free menu. She even helped change a dish to ensure we had something that was soy free. The day of the event the staff made sure that everything ran smoothly and that we were able to finish our lunch in the short time allowed. Overall, it was a great experience and I am still getting compliments from attendees about how great the food and service was. Thank you Kim and everyone at  P.F. Changs Long Beach!",90802

I believe they have a deal where two people can eat for $20. The food can be a bit garlicy at times but 9 times out of 10, it's tasty. I love their orange chicken and mongolian beef.

I ordered the lunch plate version of a full meal they offer because it was cheaper and I am a starving grad student. Because I am a starving grad student I specified to my waitress that I wanted the plate and not the meal. She later brought me the meal and when I asked her about it she said, ""well I can't read your mind"". That was it. She did nothing about my orders, charged me for the meal, and glared at me. I was in such disbelief that i didn't address it and I should have. I also made an effort to stay calm around my peers as we are studying social work and I really wanted to try to be empathetic (maybe the waitress is having a bad day).

As soon as I walked in, I walked up to the hostess stand, ready to ask for a table for two. As I walked up, three young ladies were talking and one african american young lady actually glanced up at me several times before ANOTHER young lady even acknowledged me! I stood there for what seemed like 2-3 minutes while the hostess played rock-paper-scissors while deciding who should work with a customer or something of that nature. I walked away from the hostess stand intending to leave but my boyfriend decided to stay. This was very rude and from then on I knew the night was not going to go as planned. We sat and waited for the table, which the wait time wasn't that long for a table. The hostess then sat us at a table that was still wet from whatever substance they use to clean. As we sat down at the wet table, we glanced at the menu trying to decide what to eat. An African American male approached our table with a few sauces and quickly mumbled, ""Hi. What would you like to drink?"". He said it so fast and so mumbled that I asked him to repeat himself and he said the exact same thing in the exact same dry disinterested tone. I told him that we needed a few more minutes to decide and he just walked away! He never said his name and he JUST WALKED AWAY! He then walked over to some server station where I saw him conversing with the african american hostess and I automatically knew what they were talking about. I pointed this out to my boyfriend and he was actually staring in awe because he couldn't believe how the night was going. With our appetites LOST we quickly decided we would go and have drinks somewhere else. I love PF Changs and I have NEVER experienced anything like this from your restaurant! If these employees are new you have my sincere apology but they should really receive A LOT MORE TRAINING and understand that a business is only successful IF IT HAS CUSTOMERS! Thank you.",90802

I don't get it. Staff was friendly and professional. The food was what the average prices are here in California (which is generally higher than other parts of the country). It is an attractive establishment with outdoor seating on the waterfront. So get over it and enjoy your food. We had Lorenzo for lunch and he was very accomadating, on top of our needs and prompt. We had lunch there and when you choose a lunch portion you get more than you could ask for, under $10. What's overpriced about that? We told him we liked our food spicy, so he mixed up 'the sauce' to be spicy, and with my already spicy dish, it was very good. Pleasant lunch on a beautiful afternoon.",90802

But..... that's in no way to mean that it isn't good..... the food is delicious and I love the fact that I can order to be as spicy as they can make it..... in addition to the table sauce that they mix together for you.....I can't say that I've tried many dishes here, always sticking with Kung Pao chicken, Orang Peel chicken, and Chang's Spicy chicken...... but those are always delicious..... the one dish my boyfriend and I had that was horrible, was the Seared Salad (which doesn't seem to be on the menu anymore)We don't have issues with parking because we live close enough to walk and it takes 5 to 10 minutes to get there..... if you plan on going in the evening on a weekend or holiday, make reservatons!!!!!

The rice used to come in a regular size bowl now it's in a small bowl. Any beef plate you get is undercooked. Pretty fake Asian food if u look at it. I like their calamari, lettuce wraps, Kung pao scallops or chicken. If u order Mongolian, pepper beef or beef and brocolli, make sure u tell them well cooked. The one in Vegas, in planet Hollywood is the best PF Changs to me.The wait has reduced since then. U would wait about 15 mins now because it's not as packed. The host's and waiters are ok.. Servers seem to be missing a lot. I see them stand in groups and just chitchat a lot. Esp at the front desk or bar area.But their bathroom is decorated uniquely and is always clean. I love the outside building look and statues. I also love their signature hot/ medium hot sauces. I also like how they serve mr pip! A lot of top resteraunt only serve coke and pepsi.The only thing I hate is there is no free parking anywhere around there since it's dwntwn long beach so walking distance ( the actual resteraunts parking lot ) is valet for $6..",90802

I am in a mixed relationship (he's white, I'm black) and from the moment we stepped in until the moment we left not only did the hostess, and server stare and ask nonprofessional and irrational questions, but they totally made us feel as though we did not belong and were in the wrong place. To add salt to our wounds our booth was filthy ( and yes there were plenty of other places to sit ) our silverware, plates, and glasses were filthy, and our banana spring rolls had creatures crawling on it. If that wasn't bad enough no one apologized, they asked insulting questions such as are you sure EVERYTHING is dirty, are you sure its not stains from the food, where is the bug you are referring to. Once these questions were answered and our accusations determined to be true our waitress said "" Oh looks like the bus boys forgot a spot,"" and ""That bug is so small i can't believe you even saw it,"" It must be a fruit bug that's living in our strawberries or something.""

The orange chicken was slimy, I would go as far as to say it was like Bob from the hit Dreams Works movie, Monsters vs. Aliens. The sauce had the texture similar to a sea slug. The low mien was actually quiet tasteful although my lover didn't enjoy it. The appetizers were, as my lover said ""another name for a donkey"". She did however enjoy the sushi, it being the highlight of her meal. To be honest, take your money down the street to Panda Express, where they know how to get Asian-American Cuisine right.

They walked inside and said hi and the first thing they say is ""SERVICE DOGS"" Completely rude. They then asked ""what about not service dogs?"" Because they are young and innocent. Their only respond was ""Service Dogs."" That was completely rude and unprofessional and to top it all off, as they walked away they heard them laughing. Keep in mind their wasn't anyone else at the host stand. I used to work in the restaurant industry and I would never treat customers this way. The girl in the middle was the rude employee.",92618

Unfortunately, this review is for the latter. Went here and just wanted to grab a beer at the bar (they weren't busy) - approx 6:45pm on a Tuesday (7/13). Male bartender was doing something and told me he will be right with me. Minutes go by and he still doesn't come and take my order even after he was done with his initial tasks. Later a group of customers sit at the bar and he immediately take their drink orders. I just walk out. When I read other critical reviews of this place about their poor service, it all makes sense - poor mgmt and training of the staff. Again, I don't enjoy writing reviews at all. Hopefully the mgmt of this business (and it IS a business) see this and take the appropriate measures to properly train their staff on customer service. These are the basics...",92618
5,"514 Spectrum Center Dr Irvine, CA 92618",Yasmin F.,"Laguna Hills, CA",6/10/2021,1,Decided to give this place another go since it's been a year since we had a terrible experience. A year later the service is still poor. Ordered $100 in takeout and waited 25 mins past the quoted pickup time. The dessert was missing and we had to go back and wait to find someone to help us. The online menu showed that cocktails were still available so we ordered a pear mojito. Apparently alcohol isn't available anymore for takeout. Why is it still on the online menu? Sad because there are not a lot of available GF options and I feel like we have given this place multiple tries and we want it to work but it never does.,92618

There was a chip in my bowl and a spider web behind me  and the mirror looked filthy . For a $45 lunch for two that we hardly ate I was so disappointed and won't be going back .

They have so many food options from Chinese to Japanese food etc. They have a lot of options for vegetarian which is good. We ordered California roll, egg rolls, lettuce wrap, and tonkatsu ramen. I give them 4/5 for overall. The tonkatsu ramen was a little salty for me so I added a little bit of lime and it helped bringing the taste to another level. One special thing about this place is they have outdoor dinning. So you can enjoy view and people shopping around the area at the same time.",92618

12,"514 Spectrum Center Dr Irvine, CA 92618",Sandra L.,"Orange County, CA",12/21/2020,4,"This review is written during COVID times.To start, you should know that I do not frequent P.F. Chang's on my own. The only times I come here is either when my mother-in-law wants to go or I get a gift card. The reason for this is because I think that I could get a bigger bang for my buck elsewhere and I'm not huge on Asian fusion.I got a gift card and decided to spend it today during COVID times and ordered curbside pickup. The online process was easy and the menu described what the dish contains and even offered options to make certain dishes spicier.  I was impressed by the curbside pickup service as there are dedicated numbered spots for you to park and call the restaurant. I was even more impressed with the packaging. My entire order was packed and sealed shut (left to right) in one bag. This is great if you plan to order through a delivery service because it is definitely obvious if the packaging was tampered with. All my utensils were individually wrapped and put inside another Ziploc bag with soy sauce, napkins, and fortune cookies. Just the packaging alone deserves five stars!The food was delicious - full of flavor and saucy. There is an option to get extra sauce when ordering online so of course I chose extra :). I ordered the Peking Duck ($29), Chili-Garlic Green Beans ($8), and Kung Pao Brussels Sprouts ($9).  Even though I really enjoyed all of the dishes we ordered, I still feel that the food is a bit pricey for the amount you get.  Other than that, if someone else is paying, I am down to have P.F. Chang's because the food is tasty and delicious!Way to go in going above and beyond with safety protocols, P.F. Chang's!",92618

15,"514 Spectrum Center Dr Irvine, CA 92618",Myrnelle G.,"Daly City, CA",3/10/2021,1,"This is one of those times that I wish I could actually grade a place because a star still seems quite generous. Let me first say that I don't live in the area and I've only frequented this place with my parents as this happens (correction: happened) to be one of their favorite spots. The only upside was that they weren't with me to witness the horrendous attitude problem of this obnoxious hostess. Flashback (Monday): Called the night before inquiring about reservations. I was told that to honor it, one has to call 2-hours before arriving but then was offered to make one. Ok...Day of (Tuesday): Received one text reminding me of the table and then a call while in the parking structure. I answered saying that I'm parking and should be in shortly. Hostess said in a sarcastic tone, ""Oh. So you're still coming?"" I replied, ""Yes, sorry we're running over, but again parking so hoping to get there soon."" Hostess retorted, ""Like when? How soon?""Ignoring her hurried and rude tone, I replied, ""Um...we're coming now.""At this point, I'm thinking it may surprisingly be quite packed. Why else would she be so pushy? Then I thought, this was for my niece's birthday and she asked for Asian food so it shouldn't be too much of a problem if we have to wait a bit. Upon walking out of the parking complex, I saw the rest of my party (a total of 5 with no young kids). It was their first time at the Spectrum. I was carrying a heavy birthday gift and lost track of where the restaurant was. Unfortunately, we ended up walking all the way around the plaza. During that walk, I received another text saying they gave the table up! Wow... Ok...We finally made it and noticed that it was practically empty. There were some folks, but since they had a pretty open space there was more than enough room. I was relieved! But then...Hostess (seeing us, looking irritated, and walking passed us), ""Oh, I have to get this call first so hang tight."" Shortly after, I gave her my reservation info. She frowned then had the audacity to remind me that she tried reaching us and to state the obvious that we were late. No sh*t.I responded, ""Yes, I realize that. But we're here now and luckily, there's plenty of room so...""She continued to warn us, ""If you know you're going to be late, you need to call us at least 10-minutes before...blah, blah, we'll give your table up...blah, blah.""I couldn't keep my cool and finally retorted, ""Look, we're late. I get that. But there's no one here. And I called...""She quickly interrupted me and said, ""No, I called...""I shot back, ""Yes, I meant we talked on the call, remember? I said we were here and it looks like you're not busy so is this going to be an issue?"" This was for a birthday so I'd rather not make too much of a scene, especially since we already came from walking all over the place.Embarrassingly enough, my party actually felt her rudeness and chose NOT TO EAT HERE because of it. So we left.After all that, this review was based on everything that happened BEFORE we sat down and let me tell you all, this was the absolute WORST HOSTESS ever and I have been everywhere. I will be getting in touch with the manager (yes, I'm going to be that customer) because in my stress and anger, I failed to get this millennial's name, but I will never forget her behavior.",92618
16,"514 Spectrum Center Dr Irvine, CA 92618",Sharon W.,"Newport Beach, CA",7/27/2021,1,I arrived at 8:35pm on Tuesday evening. More than half of the restaurant is empty.

17,"514 Spectrum Center Dr Irvine, CA 92618",Michael Min C.,"San Francisco, CA",5/30/2021,2,"We came here for dinner May 27th a family party of six people. I have to say the dining experience was a 2 out of 5 experience. First of all I checked in at 7:25 pm with the receptionist to put my name down for a table. I checked back 30 minutes later and she said the table has paid but has not left yet. So I was thinking how about a different table since I saw several open tables in the restaurant. At almost 8:30 pm, we had now waited an hour and FYI the restaurant closes at 9 pm; I walk back in to check on our table again and she then finally seats us at a table that had been empty the whole time. The restaurant was not full but it took another 15 minutes to order since our waitress was not around. I had to ask someone else to take our order. So far the experience has sucked and I don't know why the manager at the Spectrum PF Chang's is just not on the ball. We ordered the edamame, calamari and vegetable tempura, pork dumplings, wonton soup, bulgogi steak, eggplant, two kids honey chicken and the kids fried rice.The food was overall pretty good especially the eggplant, and the calamari. The bulgogi steak is not recommended because it is tough and chewy. The quality of meat used for this dish is not of high quality. They say they use New York steak but it tasted more like hangar steak. The kids honey chicken meals were good.Overall, not a good dining experience. No need to come back since there are so many better dining options at the Irvine Spectrum.",92618

I had spoken to a male host who told me I was confirmed for my reservation. Comes 7:00pm, the ladies in the front tell me I don't have one, but they'd squeeze me in (which I appreciate, thank you). They kept emphasizing that the wait would be 20+ minutes for a booth, which I kept telling them I was okay with, but it made me feel like they wanted me to change my mind and leave. Once we were seated, we noticed the table was still wet and was not even wiped down properly. Half the table was wet and the other half was sticky. After being somewhat pushy about the wait time, it made us feel like they set this up last minute and was trying to rush us in when I told them I was willing to wait. Besides this mess in the beginning, our server was very nice and the food came out pretty fast. Our favorites was the shrimp and lobster sauce, fried rice, and the steak. The peking duck was pretty dry, the orange chicken didn't have the crunch you'd expect and it was super orange-y. One thing I liked about their menu was that some of the drink options had a spiked alternative, which was fun. Would I come back to dine in? Probably not, but it's nice to know some of their food options are good, so take out is still an option.",92618

Another 25 minutes and there is nothing on our table yet but the waitress comes back to take our dinner order! The food once it arrived was excellent.

We ordered the chang for two and ordered chicken lettuce wraps, Honey glaze chicken, and Mongolian beef. The Mongolian beef was my favorite I would definitely recommend that option.

I was getting up to ask if we had a server when we finally got one. She was very nice though but after waiting 1.5 hours for a table we were starving.The food was also very average. The best thing was the Mongolian beef. We got ramen and it was so flavorless I really wished I had got something else. The edamame also lacked flavor. The chicken lettuce wraps were good however more than half of it was the little crunchy things and hardly any of the chicken mix. I usually love chain restaurants including pf changes.

We told him we were fine with having 2 people of our party of 4 stand around drink and wait for our table. He basically didn't let us take the two bar stools because he had a white couple sit instead of us Mexicans. I felt racial profile even thou he's a Mexican bartender.

52,"514 Spectrum Center Dr Irvine, CA 92618",Lily E.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",11/16/2020,1,"Let me start out by saying this has been my favorite restaurant for as long as I can remember. That being said what happened to this place?The portions have shrunk so much  and the ribs, why am I paying over $11 for ribs with barely visible meat on them? Extra chicken use to include a lot more and now its four additional pieces/bites for $2.50 extra.I spoke to the manager of this location as well as the chef their explanation is this:1. the portions have shrunk due to COVID, corporates no longer feels it cost effective to sell the same portions they use to after such a loss from the pandemic. So we (customers) pay more because they lost revenue.2. The chef says the ribs are coming in with poor selections and he chooses the best ones he can but cooperate has chosen to go a cheaper route not purchasing the same quality of meats.So overall, after taking all things into consideration PF Changs has gotten lazy about their products. As a customer I have come to expect a certain level of cuisine to be offered at Changs.  We have all hit financial snags and troubles due to COVID, however the food needs to match the product in everyway from quality to serving sizes. We have come to expect to a certain price for a certain portion size and quality of the dish. If you lower the standard you need to lower your prices.",92618

Tonight's experience was so disappointing. If it was our first time to P.F. Chang's, it would have been our last. The Mongolian beef was so over cooked and had little sauce so it was tough to chew. I threw most of it away. My husband had the beef and broccoli a d his meat was dry and over cooked as well.

What was even more surprising was that she was quick to attend the surrounding tables, but left our table un attended the whole time we were their.The food quality really went down the drain in this place as well. P.F Changs was one of favorite restaurants pre-pandemic and since then the quality and flavors of the food has tremendously diminished. My cravings for their broccoli beef were off the roof and was disappointed with the plate i received. Broccoli tasted like It let was tossed from a boiling pot of water and left unseasoned. My son was also ordered a plate of fried rice with a side of fruit and the fruit was unpleasantly sour.My girlfriend and I were left in distraught and will no longer be returning to this P.F Changs location.

We had a 6:00 reservation and the table that we were going to be seated at was taking their time leaving after they paid the bill so the two ladies at the front desk were very apologetic and nice while we were waiting. After about 10 minutes they asked us if we would mind sitting in an area that wasn't really being used behind the main seating area which was not close to anyone else but still felt part of the restaurant. We were very happy to take that option because we were trying to stay away from the other tables anyway. Rob the manager came over right away and asked us if everything was okay and told us any appetizer we order would be on the house because we were so nice during the delay. The hospitality was amazing. Maya, our waitress was very pleasant and did everything perfectly! On top of all this wonderful hospitality the food was amazing. The best Chinese food I've had in a long time. We had the sampler appetizer. Everything was delicious especially the crab wontons. Then we had sesame chicken and the house combo lo mein. Both were perfectly cooked! We also had an Asian pear mojito and a strawberry lemonade which were both delicious. Overall it was an amazing experience made possible by the restaurant staff.

The hostess walked us to our table but forgot to give us utensils. Our server took about 10 minutes to make initial contact with our table and ask for our order. It wasn't a really busy night nor a light night business wise. I stood up and asked the hostess for utensils after waiting for our server to approach our table once more (it had been 15 minutes since the first time she approached us) she replied ""we don't have any upfront but I can get you some from the back- plastic ones... I pointed at the utensils that were rolled up nicely in a black box next to her and asked .. ""why can't I have the regular ones?"" She starred at me and replied ""I'll just get the ones from the back."" I'm still wondering what she meant by giving us the plastic ones. Needless to say the server was not very attentive*no refills *sushi without soy sauce *asked for siracha, the siracha never came *my son wanted a side of fruit, never got the chance to ask for one *the server never asked my wife for her drink order, just gave her waterI will never come back to this P.F.

Service: The servers are generally nice, but very SLOW. Even when the restaurant is not busy, they seem super stressed out. The last three times we have gone, our drinks were made and sat at the bar for at least 10 minutes waiting to be brought to our table. It's not the biggest deal to me, but my mom orders mojitos and the initial fizz is always gone by the time we get our drinks. One time, it was so bad, nobody even came to get our drink order for 20 minutes so we ordered them at the bar. That same day we were served by 4 different people because nobody was paying attention to us. I will say that if something is messed up they will fix it. Food & Drinks: The food is always good and typically, we get the correct order. The drinks are good too. I recommend the peach boba drink. It's so yummy. Location: The Spectrum is amazing!!",92618

So there's really no point in my posting on here, unless perhaps someone in the corporate test kitchen reads this.So much of restaurant dining is influenced by the senses,  and presentation, as you know, is everything!Last night we had the lettuce wraps, which I thought were delicious. My friend had the beef, which was tasty, but just a boring plate of nothing but beef and pieces of Green onion.   It wasn't a balanced meal, visually, or nutritiously.I had the shrimp with lobster sauce, and while it was tasty, it looked like a plate full of vomit. Everything on the plate was a tan/brown color. The shrimp were cooked very well, and plentiful, but there were no vegetables, or anything of color on the plate. It was just a big puddle of brown goo. And the ""gravy"" that the shrimp was served in was flavorful, but it certainly wasn't  lobster sauce. And yes, I know that you develop these recipes in a corporate test kitchen somewhere. But everybody knows from culinary school that it's all about presentation, presentation, presentation!You need to rework your dishes so that they have a balance of vegetables and protein.

They are clearly not ready to open back up to the public, I sat waiting for about an hour (was told it would be 25 minutes) watching them scramble to sit people who had reservations. They have maybe 7 spots for seating and in that entire time no one had left. They also repeatedly told customers after us 25 to 30 minutes (which was clearly wrong). If you are reading this P.F. Chang's, you need to limit how long people can dine in for, stop taking reservations (there is not enough seats for that) and be more realistic with your wait time.P.S. don't get me wrong the staff was super nice, but I'm writing this review from a different restaurant, an hour after putting out names down ( when there was only 1 maybe 2 families in front of us ) and I still haven't received a text.",92618

The service here is consistently very friendly, helpful and good and food is always prepared well. Yeah, yeah, I know this is Americanized Chinese food, but I don't care.  I have always enjoyed PF Chang's. The recent remodel of this place has made it look much more attractive inside, and they have a nice bar and patio if you prefer that to indoor dining.Their new menu has undergone some nice changes, too. I will admit I'm a creature of habit here a lot when ordering, but since I am a member of the rewards program which I would highly recommend joining as it i's free, I have tried a lot of new entrees.  I am often sent deals for buy one entree get one free which I take advantage of.  As far as food goes here, I am a big fan of their Salt and Pepper Prawns,  Chang's Spicy Chicken and Chicken Lettuce Wraps as three of my most favorite things here.  I also enjoy their cocktails and, of course, their desserts here. ;)  Their dessert menu includes mini desserts which makes you feel a little bit better about indulging in something sweet. I recently tried the mini Strawberry Coconut which was excellent.This PF Chang's is the closest one to where I live, so I often order food to go from here, also.  Glad the Spectrum has kept this restaurant around with all the recent remodeling changes as it is a place I do frequent here as far as food and service goes.",92618

Chang's to merely ask her what amount I was getting credited since they completely messed up our New Year's Eve order and she cut me off and wouldn't even listen to my question.  She said to take it up with door dash although I ordered through their website even though they messed up not door dash .  I am shocked that P.F. Chang's has hired such an unprofessional person for their establishment.  Backstory.. we had ordered their party trays for 30 +people and door dash arrived and brought the items and when I asked if the chafing dishes and sternos were there door dash said no and neither was rice , lettuce wraps so the door dash rep was so sweet she ran back to go get the missing items but by then our guests were already waiting to eat and everything was cold and sticking together (looked pretty eh) .  So I called P.F. Chang's and whoever I spoke to was very nice and he told me he is sending the missing items through door dash again and he will refund me a portion.  I was merely calling this lame Becca to find out what that amount was and she kept cutting me off and telling me door dash will refund me the money.  She wouldn't even take my info to find out who I was and to answer the question I called in for! What kind of manager is this? How did she get to that level?  She had no accountability, no apology, nothing!  The worst manager I have ever spoken to as of today.She should not be in the customer service industry.  Terribleservice .. can't trust ordering food for a big event with this restaurant.",92618

After being greeted and seated outdoors by the host, I was quick to order a coconut mojito and a ""Japanese Old Fashioned"" which at the time of this review is advertised on their website as ""An Asian twist on a classic, made with Suntory TOKI Japanese Whisky and served over an ice square."" The Japanese Old Fashioned was great, strong, and an excellent experience.Wasn't in the mood to get a full entree let alone share it, so I just got some eggrolls, see attached photo. This came out REALLY greasy, which tells me when they pulled it out of the fryer they didn't bother placing them on paper towels to absorb a bulk of the oil first. Like literally it was enough to make me feel sick so I ended up eating only a few pieces.The decor of the place is really nice, whoever designed the lighting for the restaurant knew their interior design really well, nice balance of warm lights against dark walls, yet natural light comes in easily during the day.There is free WiFi here, and it's not bad in terms of speed, but I found myself getting kicked off the network every few minutes, but there's always the Irvine Spectrum Center public free WiFi that you can use.All in all, great drinks, nice decor, decent service, meh food, complimentary WiFi.

We sat at the bar and ordered the following:- Steamed shrimp dumplings (delish, our fave item of the night--2 orders)- Spicy tuna roll (just ok, rice had way too much vinegar)- Fried green beans (good, but did make us feel a little oogie after too many of them)- Veggie egg rolls (pretty good, not too greasy)- Japanese old fashioned (yum, generous with the suntory whisky!)Our bartender wasn't all that engaging but was very efficient, which was fine by us.

We used this as our Friday date night (9/25/20). Sadly it was the worst experience we have ever had. We had a reservation, but still waited 20 mins to get sat. No big deal- I wanted outside so I was happy to wait. Then took another 15 mins before someone greeted us once we were sat. First thing the server said was she forgot we were her table cause another server gave it to her. She said ""I don't know how long you've even been here"". Ok. Moving on- our first app came out late and was cold. We were too hungry to complain. Second app (soup) didn't come out at all until I reminded the server upon our entrees being delivered. I knew she was over worked, she collapsed on the booth beside me in defeat when I told her about the missing soup. Instead of apologizing she simply asked ""do you even still want it"". Which we did. She also misunderstood I wanted extra sauce on the side for my beef dish, not sauce on the side completely. So it was dried beef. Sad, wasn't the same. The noodles were a bit too al dente as well. I had to ask 3 times for soy sauce and had to remind our server twice for a drink refill. She never once asked if we wanted another round.Overall just every part was a disappointment. And we love PF Chang's. The server never apologized when handing the bill to us, nor offered to remove the late soup. And Never said ""thank you for dining with us"" or any other ending salutations. So odd! Sucks to pay $80-100 for such a horrible service/night we had such high anticipation for! I get it with covid they were maybe understaffed but looking around all the servers were moving like sloths and no one seemed to want to be there. I suppose I get that but no one was helping their fellow colleagues and I think I only saw the manager once. Just not at all like the experiences we normally have at fashion island location.",92618

The Walnut Shrimp with Melon is also a major crowd-pleaser in my family. Mongolian Beef, Pad-Thai, and the Sweet and Sour soup are also on the must order list!What made this visit so special was Rob.

Chang's in Irvine! We usually stay here in town but the trolleys are shut down too! We had some gift cards and I ordered lots of food items so that we would have a nice variety and leftovers. My favorite of coarse is Chang's lettuce wraps, so we ordered 2. Ordered thru the online app and it was very detailed and easy to navigate. Knowing I was going to use gift cards and website only accepts cc or pay at restaurant. No problem! Called restaurant and had first dealing with Dean Ramadan and what a pleasure he is! Explained about online order that I had just submitted and that payment would be gift cards. Dean tried to find my order but I literally had just put in order so it wasn't in the system yet. He got my details and told me to call as soon as I was there and he would finish up with payment!! Awesome, handled so professionally!! Arrived called and Dean answered and after giving him the wrong sets of numbers on gift cards twice I finally realized it's like a scratcher and those are the numbers! I was embarrassed what a dumb dumb but Dean NEVER rushed or made me feel stupid!! Dean personally brought out our food and did tell me to ""check the order as it was rather large"". I didn't do it because the large extremely hot soup almost spilled in my brand new car because my hubby is a moron (25 years, l can say that) and thank you P.F. for also putting that in an additional zip lock so it would've been a contained spill!! So me stressed out about what could've just happened we were on our way!!! All of the food made it home except for the chocolate wall slice and a biggie for me one of the sauces for the wraps!!! I'll admit we haven't been to PFs in a while but that was our go to when we would go to the movies at the spectrum! If you look at website you will see Changs lettuce wraps show 2 sauces and me being a foodie and an I'll admit tough critic, I love a good sauce!! So disappointed I emailed Dean and long story longer I am blown away impressed with response from Dean  who personally emailed back AND called my hubby!!! So FYI P.F. please rethink not putting out yummy sauces, everybody loves to have a selection . You want people to crave specific foods so you will have them as patrons for years and years!! And it's cheap let's be real!! The cheap can come out expensive if people aren't getting the tastes they remember and don't come back! We will however be back.

Chang's"" on food packagings from marketplaces and from word of mouth from other people. This was my first time ever going into the actual restaurant. The environment made me think of quiet, Asian version of Cheesecake Factory because of their long table set up and large decorations. The service was swift, polite and pleasant. Our waitress was very nice, thoughtful and generous to help us with water and food but also with helping us balance the wobbling table. As for the food. Let me get into my food critic mode haha:1. Cecilia's Dumplings : overall it was good. I think I would taste a bit better if their sauce can shine through more. Because of that it was a bit bland but if you stir the dumping in the sauce that's sprinkled around, it tastes pretty good. The presentation was very cute and tasteful. The dumpling itself was on tiny bit on the drier side but still good. 2. Sweet and Sour Chicken: the meat of the chicken wasn't very tender. The flavor of the sauce was had a bit too strong of a vinegar taste. (That's just my own preference). If you like strong flavor you might like this. As for me, it was fair.3. Crispy Honey Shrimp : I love Honey walnut shrimp but couldn't find in their menu so I wanted to try this. The crispy-ness wasn't even throughout. For example, some pieces would be crispy, some very soggy. The sauce was very good and complimented the rice nicely. I would order this dish again.My impression of this place is that it is a nicer, good environment Chinese restaurant to bring larger parties to or for a special occasion. As for the food, I would share because the portions are good for sharing family style. My overall experience was very good.",92618

As advertised these dishes are suppose to be prepared from scratch? The selected dishes all tasted the same and with very little flavor.  PF Chang's has gone down hill fast and unfortunately our family meal was a waste of money. Not sure if it's even worthy of a one star rating.,92618

If you want chinese but you're with a date, this is your best option unless you can pull a funny Panda Express meal off. But I doubt it. How you gonna compete with giant horse statues and ancient Chinese armor huh? That's right, they have a freaking vest in the center of a table like it's nothing, like places usually have ancient Chinese battle vests on their tables. How amazing is that?Like add a few dollars to your Panda express lunch amazing? Definitely. If they didn't have a lunch deal, I'd be disappointed at the entree size. For 16 bucks, I expected more quantity wise, even for this Fancy Panda Express. When our orange chicken and beef with broccoli came out, the meat wasn't crowding the plate, it looked more empty than full! Nonetheless, 2 entrees was good enough for 3 guys so it's do-able, just not very impressive for their entree size. If I didn't use the buy one get one coupon emailed to me from the Irvine Co, I'd go with the lunch option for ten bucks, seems like a better value than 16 for a skimpy little dish. Their organic Agave margarita is solid too, strong enough to taste the tequila but not so much that the lime is drowned out. Pricey at 11 bucks but hey, it's Fancy Panda Express! Gotta make back that money spent on giant horse statues somehow...",92618

I sometimes crave good Americanized Chinese food and PF Chang's does pretty good job. My favorite appetizer is chicken lettuce wraps. The flavor of the ground chicken was good but the particular batch of lettuce we got were kind of stuck together and very thin so the sauce kept on leaking and got a bit messy. I remember that the lettuce they used to use were thicker so I don't know what happened there.We also got veggie lo mein and Mongolian beef. They were both pretty good and not too greasy.,92618

I did this with the kung poa sauce and brown rice.  Prepared wonderfully.  I also had the vegetable spring rolls and a strawberry coconut creame mini cake.  All were delicious.I thought this visit was gonna go bad based on some previous reviews and the slow initial service but my waitress really delivered and redeemed the visit.  Thanks Jenny!  Truly excellent service!",92618

Of course we had to try the Kung Pao shrimp, since everyone and their momma's talk about it. Unfortunately, it wasn't that impressive and I only ate 2 shrimps haha. The breading around the shrimp was weird with the sauce because it ends up soggy. The salmon, on the other hand, was good! Nicely cooked to where it wasn't too dry and the glaze gave the veggies a really nice flavor. I like they offer brown rice, as well. Waiter was a bit slow to the point where I was getting impatient for her to refill my water or take the check, even though it wasn't that busy.

I live close by so occasionally go there but it seems like this location does not want your business. They are open until 11 but if you show up at 10 or 1030 the staff will literally make you feel unwelcome and don't hide the fact that they do no want to serve you. This has happened on three separate occasionsand it makes sense that besides weekends they are usually empty. I only go here out of necessity when most things are closed and regret it now.

When we arrived to pick up the food, the hostess said she would check on our order. She went about her business and never reported back to us. 10 minutes later I asked her if the order was ready and she said there was one more item they needed to complete.  15 minutes go by and I ask another person where our order is and they send someobe back to the kitchen to see where our food is.  Again, no one reports back to us as we just sit and wait.

This location is beautiful, and the food was good as always! They did change their menu, however, and I was a little disappointed, but the food was still stellar. The food:Street Noodles: 4/5, I was very impressed with the flavors in this dish! The curry sauce with the shrimp and vegetables was amazing; the vegetables were fresh, and the noodles were cooked perfectly. New favorite dish! California Roll: 3/5, not terrible, not outstanding. The crab mix was flavorless; however, the cucumber and avocado were very fresh! Average California roll. Shrimp Tempura Roll: 4/5, shrimp tempura rolls are my favorite, so I know a good shrimp tempura roll when I taste one. This one wasn't outstanding, but it was pretty good! Again, the cucumber and avocado were fresh (which makes or breaks the sushi), and the umami sauce tasted great with the shrimp and crab mix. Great roll!Service: 4/5, I'm pretty sure our server's name was Ahmed, and he was quite good! He was helpful and always coming to check on us.

So an out of town friend wanted to meet here despite my protests of having to slug my way through traffic and parking and people and more people-- you get the point.   Going to the spectrum on a Friday night is punishment! My lil guy ordered the Lo Mein which and he didn't finish his plate which is a first when it comes to noodles(a sign) -- anyways on to what I got:Spicy tuna roll--0 stars- there is no way that this was made onsite, it looked like the sushi you get at Stater Bros next to the other meat.  The sushi at Albertsons is better in my opinion! The tuna portion was light , and it was cleanly packed into the roll. I wasn't expecting a 100 star roll, but to pay $10 for a roll I can get for $3 at the store is a bummer.   Maybe I'm wrong and they make it onsite, but it doesn't taste like it.   I like some of their other food, and I would come back, but never again for sushi.  (Hot n sour soup!)

That being said, if you're looking for a more ""milder"" version of your Chinese dishes, you should try this place. I am actually a fan of the lo mein and the shrimp garlic noodles. The lo mein is better IMHO but the shrimp in the noodle dish is bomb. The food's not as greasy as other places so you won't feel too guilty afterward.

Although the food tasted delicious, we were not happy about the amount of Mongolian beef we had; this entree costs 20 dollars and we expected to receive 20 dollars worth of a meal but we were given a tiny portion that looked like it was worth 8 dollars; it would not even be enough to fill one person. I have attached pictures to show the exact amount but we were baffled. We were really disappointed with our dinner last night and we really hope that they work to fix this because it isn't fair to be ripped off entirely on one meal that cost 20 dollars.

I get that it was Mother's Day and during the pandemic things are busy and tough for restaurants. They have been promoting the Mother's Day meal deal and I thought that would be a great way to do a dinner for my family and their mom who likes PF Chang's. I went and ordered everything online through the PF Chang's website early, 3 hours before my selected delivery time. I picked to have it delivered and I guess it was sent through Door Dash on their end. Our driver headed to this location 30 minutes early to pick-up our order and I was notified by Door Dash of this. He then texted me and said the line and wait at the restaurant was tremendous. I told him our order should be good seeing as I had pre-ordered it. He said the restaurant told him it was not ready and to wait with everyone else. He proceeded to wait from 715pm, past our expected delivery of 730pm, and until 750pm when the restaurant told him it may take up to another hour to get our order! That is ridiculous. He was then texting us pictures of people waiting inside all over the restaurant for food. He then said the restaurant was mass cancelling orders because they were too overwhelmed. All of the people and delivery drivers there were extremely upset. He was a great driver giving us all the updates by text and apologizing. Our order was then cancelled by text to me at 800pm from this location because it was unable to fulfill the order. What a joke of a night! Mother's Day dinner for my family was ruined because of the unpreparedness of this restaurant! I was never informed of this other than a text message saying cancelled, long after we should of had our delivery. I am extremely upset at how poorly managed this night and this location are. I will take my business elsewhere. We ended up having burgers from another restaurant that took a late order and handled it perfectly while busy. Thanks for nothing PF Chang's!",92618

Restaurant was crowded but we got seated very quickly.It took more than an hour to get our food done. We had to put it in to-go boxes. The big party of 4 with 3 kids got served 20 minutes before us, even if they got seated after us. Not to mention we had to give up our booth for them. Really?Now we're late to our showtime, our Saturday plans are ruined, probably won't be able to see that stupid movie at all now, since our schedule is tight. Thanks PF Chang's. I completely understand this is the first time in many years you don't have enough staff to serve all customers. Not coming here again, ever. What a shitshow.To anyone reading this- only come here of you extremely bored and got nothing else to do other than sipping drinks As I'm writing this, it's almost 30 minutes after movie started and we still waiting for our boxes and my credit card. 82 bucks charged, totally worth it.Good job, you actually made me write this, well done guys.",92618
194,"514 Spectrum Center Dr Irvine, CA 92618",Lauren P.,"Lake Forest, CA",5/11/2020,1,"I'm one of many reviews I'm sure will appear about the events at this location tonight. I'm just going to state what happened. I have thoughts and opinions on actions I think should have been taken, but it's not my place. Instead, here was the (likely last) experience here:I had so many emails from PF Chang's about preordering for Mother's Day. I have family in the restaurant/hospitality business. I know that Mother's Day is usually the worst/busiest/most challenging holiday for restaurants. So I ordered Friday night for 5:30pm Sunday night. 5:30: arrived at curbside pickup for my 5:30 order. Called the number on the email. 15 minutes waiting to let them know I was here. In short I was told my order is not ready, we're running a half hour behind. If you want to wait at curbside that's cool, just call us back in a little while. I mentioned it takes 15 minutes to get through. Again, was told the order hasn't been prepared, not ready. Call back later. 6:00: 10 minutes on hold. Connect with another employee. Very little information for me. Couldn't find order. Then he says they haven't started cooking it yet, call again later, maybe in 45 minutes. I ask ""what's the process? It seems like no one's really been informed. They're just telling everyone to keep calling."" Manager gets on the phone. Explains they're running probably an hour and 15 behind. He suggests calling at 6:45. They have so many orders. He says they can totally do curbside as I am not comfortable or prepared to be around a group right now ( I can see the gathering outside the restaurant from my rear view mirror.) Just call back and we'll see if your order is ready and we can bring it out. We thought about leaving but realized they already had my payment online. I'm sure they'd charge me and I'd have to spend time this week disputing the charge with my credit card company. 6:45. Make the call. After asking a guy who walked by my car how long his wait was (hour and 20), I felt pretty confident we were going to have food soon. I spent 21 minutes on hold. The super nice security guy who had been walking around asked if I was waiting for PF Chang's. He then tells me that he was told they stopped taking calls and are only updating people inside the restaurant. He says I'm okay to leave my car there at curbside but one of us should probably go inquire in person because he's been told to spread the message that there's no more phone calls. 7:10 There's little signage outside the restaurant. One sign next to a line of 20 people by the bar that says ""window for orders"". But then there's 25-30 people congregating inside too. So which line? I pick the one outside because I feel my chances are better and also I can keep some distance between others. A few people ask me if this is the line for pickup orders and I tell them I'm honestly not certain. I can't find anyone to ask so I figure I'd just pick one. One guy walks out with his food and overheard me and nicely says, ""I just want to let you guys know, my order was for pickup at 5:50 and I just now got it"". 10 minutes later I hear someone from the bar calling names and he calls mine. I walk past everyone in line to retrieve it. I see only two people working. I can't see any other employees from the bar, but it was so crowded inside, it's hard to tell. I get my first apology for the wait.  I double check it and see two items are missing. There's also about 25 bags sitting at the bar, ready to go. I chat with others near me about their experience. They also were told repeatedly ""We're really busy. We don't have the ability to update you on your order. We're busy - come back later"". People are angry however I'm surprised that everyone is keeping their cool. I'm able to let someone know the items I'm missing. Few minutes and they get it taken care of with another thank you and I'm so sorry. We walked in the door just before 8:00 with dinner. I feel so bad that my mom's Mother's Day/Sunday evening has just been eaten up. Then as I get ready to take all the food out, I realize ...I don't think the employees were wearing masks. Took extra caution to re-plate everything, careful not to touch clean plates after touching takeout packaging. Ugh - it was a truly terrible experience. Quite possibly the worst restaurant blunder I've had yet. The food did taste exactly as I would expect from PF Chang's, so thank you to the Chef(s). I just don't know after this experience how I can return to this location. It's just really soured my view; it would be hard to return and not remember the whole situation.",92618

It's always busy, especially starting Thursday evenings and the weekend. We got lucky, and were provided a table within a few minutes. However, it took the server well over 10 minutes after that to come and ask us for drinks (water). It gave my wife and I good time to converse, look around and catch up on the day's activities. After having the Veggie Spring Rolls as appetizers which we always enjoy, my wife got her favorite Spicy Tofu dish, and I had their Veggie noodles. It took another 20 minutes for the dinner to arrive. The dishes were well made and tasteful. My wife almost finished her whole plate (she's hungry)  and I kept nibbling away. We even had room for one of their mini guiltless desserts. Overall, we had a fun time and look forward to visiting again on a less busy day.",92618

We also got the Pepper Steak with Hot n Sour Soup So salty that we couldn't finish! It's like they don't taste how salty it is or realize how much salt they put in the food! Service was blah.... Not the greatest. Our server came after 3 min we have seated. Took our drink order. Came back after another few minute and took our order. Another server came by and brought our soup...

203,"514 Spectrum Center Dr Irvine, CA 92618",A R.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",1/1/2020,1,Quite disappointed with how our online order was taken care of. We placed the order at 4:30pm which said the order would be ready in 25-30 minutes and didn't actually receive the food until 6:45pm. The food wasnt very hot when we got it. Chicken tonkatsu was terrible and didnt taste like a tonkatsu ramen should taste. I asked for no mushrooms in the chicken and tofu lo mein (even says it on the order ticket) but found loads of mushrooms in it. The tofu was really watery and squishy like it wasn't properly cooked and essentially fried water. What really upset us is there was no ETA on when it would actually be ready and were kinda left in the dark if the food was even being prepared or not. The most they did was comp some of the cost. No complimentary soda for the wait. Could barely get a water while waiting,92618

It's usually busy, but they try to get you in quickly. The service is great from the moment the hostesses greet you until the time you leave. The servers do a wonderful job keeping you happy and a manager or two is always roaming around making sure the guests are doing well.The food is always great, although I don't consider it authentic Chinese. We always start with their lettuce wraps and are our favorite. For the main courses, my daughters like orange chicken and Mongolian beef. For seafood I prefer the lobster fried rice, sea bass and the black pepper shrimp.They also have some great desserts, which most traditional Chinese restaurants are not known for. If you're a chocolate lover they have the flourless chocolate dome or the Great Wall of Chocolate. Both an awesome way to end your meal.",92618

We asked to sit outside in the patio, the restaurant was not busy at all and we can see many servers are just standing there and do nothing. We stayed on out table for 20 min, no greeting no one asked us if we want something to drink. Went to the front desk and asked for a server to take our order, and in my way i saw 3 servers talking next to the patio door and 2 servers inside just talking and not busy. I went back to my table waiting for the server, and while waiting there was a lady with her daughter who just arrived and sat next to our table, but she was lucky and a server came to take her order. The lady told the server that we came first and he should take our order first, but he said there is another server coming to our table. After 10 minutes of waiting, we decided To walk out, and save the server's timeBad customer service, 20 min on my table and no one came, talked to them to get their attention and after 10 min nothing changed. And this message for the restaurant manager, don't comment under this review by asking for more details. If you want details, check your security camera i was there Oct 11, 2019 at 4:50 pm.

Per the attached photo, but 90% of the restaurant is empty so wtf lol. Happened to us two times so shame on me! Makes me wonder what the Indeed job description says. Most customers who dine at P.F. Chang's are the same people who enjoy the universal interior designs of Chinese franchise restaurants with servings of Panda Express quality food- with more expensive brands of cane sugar and soy sauce. Don't get me wrong, I love their food (hence the three stars instead of one), but don't expect the receptionist to welcome you with open arms is all I'm saying.

They also have family platters that are double the portion for 10 dollars more. The Mongolian beef did not come out as double portion- had a bunch of noodles to take up space.

I ordered a pad Thai but the portion of meat and noodles was very small topped with a lot of raw carrots and chives cut in very large pieces to make it like an average size dish. I wondered how can you eat those large pieces of carrots and chives with chops or would they even fit your mouth!!! Manager was walking around and I was hoping he's gonna come to the table as a customary practice so I can mention my concerns but it never happened. I've had pat Thai from many places in the past and this one was no where near to be called pat Thai. More like a carrots and chives salad.,92618

The dynamite shrimp is also an excellent appetizer, the chicken cesaer salad is one of my favorite entrees as well.

The wonderful but unlucky trio, working for PF Changs restaurant at the Irvine Spectrum yesterday, Nov. 19, 2018, were Diana, Nicole and manager, Dean Ramadan. My friend refuses to dine at any restaurant without some sort of a coupon or deal applied. Before placing her order, she will always scan her cell phone, search her purse for coupons/deals. Unfortunately, she was unable to find ""the deal"" which she ""thought"" she had on her cell phone, to discount her order. Nearly one hour into her search, and still no luck, and even with manager, Dean Ramadan, now involved, still did not find ""the"" coupon"" in question. She finally settled for a different type of deal which was readily available at the restaurant, without any coupons applied. Yes! We could finally order...one hour later! If you think that was the end of it, guess again. My friend, once again, needed yet another deal. So she decided to purchase a gift card to pay for the bill. This too resulted in issues, not of the restaurant's fault, but rather, the way my friend wanted the gift card to be applied.  Again, all 3 PF Changs staff members, Nicole, Diana and manager, Dean Ramadan, stepped up to the plate and resolved my friend's latest challenge. To my surprise, just as my friend and I were one foot out the door of the restaurant, the manager, Dean Ramadan, approached us one last time, and politely explained the process and their gift card policy, adding that it was implemented for the customer's protection. As my friend and I walked towards the parking lot to our car, I told her it was unbelievable, that despite what she has put them through, the manager, Dean Ramadan, still saw us out the door to make sure we were happy.  Not once during the ordeal, which was caused by my friend, inside the restaurant, did Diana, Nicole and manager, Dean Ramadan, show us any sign of frustration or impatience. All three never stopped smiling, all three gave my friend all the time she needed, and all three made sure our dining (lunch) experience was to our satisfaction. If I can give this branch 10 stars, I would. I could never have that kind of patience for my annoying friend. Love her, but she's annoying.",92618

We arrived and were seated at 8pm and didn't get our food until about 9:10pm. I was very surprised because we ordered our food pretty quickly. Our first waiter barley checked on us but then we got a new waiter who was very friendly and on top of everything. I was disappointed with how long it took us to have a dinner. We were all hungry and had to wait a long time for our food. We also waited an even longer amount of time for our check. By the end of the dinner I just wanted to get out of there because of how slow the service was. My sister and I shared the lomein noodles (vegetable) and the kung pao chicken. The noodles were good. I felt like there was way more vegetables and barley any noodles. The chicken was too dry for me. I wish there was more sauce or flavor to the chicken because it was too dry. The portions were ridiculously small for the price we paid. I mean seriously 12$ for veggies with barley any noodles? Almost 18$ for a small plate of dry chicken that needed way more sauce??? Overall I thought this place was very overpriced for the flavors of the food. The amount of time we had to wait was way too long. I probably will not be returning here unless I had no other option. I would rather eat some authentic asian food somewhere else for a cheaper price!,92618

We ordered Mongolian beef, honey seared chix, beef noodles, lettuce wrap, and wonton soup. The portions were generous for 4 ppl. However, it took over an hour to get our food. We were told 20 mins on the phone. When we got there, nothing was ready,  so we left for dessert after waiting for 30 mins. We came bk and we're asked again what we ordered?

Even though this spot will not entice or even merely satisfy the meticulously trained tongue, it offers me dishes and flavors I have been accustomed to enjoying for over fifteen years. That being said, if you can set aside the idea of seeking dishes and flavors that you can find all over Westminster and Garden Grove, then you can really enjoy many of the menu items here. If they ever change their chicken lettuce wrap recipe, I will have a serious bone to pick with them. Same goes for the melt in your mouth Oolong Chilean sea bass and their oh-so satisfying wonton soup. These are my religious go-to's whenever dining here (as you can see from my pictures). One fantastic addition to their most recent menu is the Long Life Noodle with Garlic Prawns. The shrimp are so crispy and coated in yummy garlic flavor, served over a tasty bed of garlic noodles (definitely NOT a date-friendly entree lol). Well done.Sadly over all these years of patronage, the service has been the most lacking part of every experience. Such a bummer that I go in expecting for the service to be sub-par, but they have proven it to me time and time again. However, I continue to look the other way when I am craving their food. We often take advantage of their curb side to-go, for this reason and also when we want to pick up something in a time crunch!",92618

Apparently a large party WHO GOT SEATED AFTER US (my husband could see them come in), had their ticket ahead of us (wtf)Finally our food came out at 7:10pm. The manager came around and gave us a half (you know what) apology about the ""large party ahead of us"" but that was about it. We quickly scarfed our food down, got the included dessert to go, and ran to our movie after paying the bill in full (no discount for those wondering).It's truly unfortunate because we go to that theatre quite often and the dynamite shrimp was great with large portions and I loved the noodles, but sadly we won't be coming in anytime soon due to the wait times and meh apology and lie.

Changs can be really 'hit or miss'.  This inconsistency is what plagues this chain, especially when it comes to service.  Their price point is set rather high, and their portion sizes rather low, so service has to be on point to make the overall experience worth the visit.  In general, our selections were pretty tasty.  The Mongolian Beef was moist, tender, and savory.  The Orange Peel Chicken was tangy and delicious.  We especially liked the Saigon Summer Rolls and the Crab Wontons.Where did they fall short?  It took ages for a server to acknowledge us... well over 20 minutes, and we were wanting to catch a movie.  Having to flag someone down isn't a great way to start the meal.  Next, after we placed our order for the Summer Rolls, it took yet another 20 minutes to arrive.  In fact, the entrees appeared less than one minute after the appetizer did.  The coup de grâce occured on the following business day.  The hubs and I realized we had both left our sunglasses in our booth.  Calling over (well before the lunch rush), the host explained that no one had turned them in, but she only had me on hold for about 15 seconds while she ""looked"", which left me with a bad impression as well.  Now, I get that we are responsible for our own belongings.  But, working in restaurants for a quite a while, I know that any time a server / busser finds lost items, there is a standard protocol to take them to the host stand, or give them to a manager.  So, they were likely just discarded or relocated, if the host had even asked to begin with.  So.... two stars.  The service was the pits, but at least the meal was good.  We probably won't be back.",92618

In my opinion, the price is quite fair in terms of the quality and preparation of the menu. You can probably get a 25% discount gift card at Costco if you want to save money. There are ways to save money.My wife is almost never happy to eat some of the restaurants here in Orange County unless it is a Korean authentic restaurants. We almost went there at least 2 times a week for the past 3 weeks, and my wife never wanted to quit coming there with our family of 4 people. It is probably the best Asian restaurant we ever had in the past 5 years living in the United States after we left Korea for my retirement.",92618

First time was at the Anaheim location and really enjoyed ourselves.We got here around 9:30 pm last night.  Party of 4, sat down within 5 minutes. Shrimp Dumplings (6 pcs) $9.75- Not bad, but not memorableCrab Wonton's (6pcs) $7.95- where was the crab?! Skip it!!!Crispy Green Beans $7.75- Crispy, yes. Flavor, NO!Orange Peel Chicken $13.95- BIG disappointment!! Pepper Steak $15.95- Beef was salty BUT the vegetables were cooked perfect. Crispy Honey Shrimp $17.50- the only thing ""decently"" flavored. Long Life Noodle & Prawns $14.95- Prawns were SALTY!!! Who is training these cooks?! Banana Spring Rolls $7.50- nice dessert. Server gave us an extra scoop of ice cream at no charge! Overall, this was NOT a good dining experience.  For the prices they charge they sure give small portions.

Very disappointed with this dish at this location.",92618
291,"514 Spectrum Center Dr Irvine, CA 92618",Liz T.,"Buena Park, CA",1/5/2019,2,"I was shocked at the quality of food as I had been to PF Chang's once before (although it was a long time ago) I still remember it being really great. After dining here, I now understand the three star average. We came in for lunch around 1. The hostess was really friendly. It was not busy, but there were tons of staff. The server was fine in the very beginning, but once we got our main course, he paid no attention to us. He walked by us several times and was purposely turning his head away from us each time, but I could see him actively engaging with other non busy staff right after. It was strange. I gave up and just went to grab the water pitcher sitting at the server station myself. Once he saw me, he quickly brought more water. As for the food, the dragon roll was great, and my friend really enjoyed the spare ribs in bbq sauce even though I thought it was only okay, kinda dry underneath and stringy. For the mains, I asked our server which was better, the honey crisp chicken, walnut shrimp, or ma po tofu. He gave a very wishy-washy answer and then finally recommended the tofu. We were pretty disappointed by that dish. Also, the rice was dry which I was not fond of. The surf and turf was okay. I liked the shrimp and potatoes. The meat was okay. The dish was definitely not worth $23 though. I know this is more Americanized asian food, but I can confidently say Panda Express has better food than this place. I was really annoyed because I was expecting so much more and was willing to pay the higher prices for a decent meal. Sadly, this place sells overpriced barely mediocre food. There are way better options in the spectrum for similar and lower price points, so I suggest spend your money elsewhere.",92618

First, we got to Spectrum early and it was literally not crowded with 40 or more tables OPEN yet they made people wait 20 minutes to make it look busy or some wierd reason?? and about 20 staff were hanging out doing nothing in back. People were complaining yet noone helped. 2nd Ordered Apple Martini the bar did not have regular olives to go with it, only blue cheese olives.

295,"514 Spectrum Center Dr Irvine, CA 92618",Inoka J.,"Fullerton, CA",2/28/2020,1,I went with my family to have our lunch while shopping. As we entered there were no one to welcome at the counter hence we sat and waited till someone arrives . Raylene the front counter staff walked in to the counter and we were not welcomed. Little later she left the counter just ignoring us . Few minutes later some other white customers walked in stood by the counter. We were so shocked as she appeared very promptly and were trying to help them. When she was trying to talk to them gentlemen who stood by the counter pointed us us and said they were before us. Then she looked at us and asked how many in our family. I said four and she walked with some menus and let us sit down . We waited there after few minutes Diana server walked in and didn't check whether the table was arranged with the utensils and other stuff. Took our order as taking from homeless people eating for free. We had to ask for the utensils and other stuff one by one.FYI it was not crowded or busy at that time . Only four to five tables were used . My issue is with the customer service. Maybe because we look brown look like Indians we were treated that way . When I was pointing out the service and how we treated not satisfied . Diana and another guy call Liam had a big attitude and went away which made us so disappointed. Never expected this from a restaurant in a chain have recruited these kind of staff and not trained with the customer service.Finally manager walked in and tried to help us. He understood that we were not treated well . He was very polite and treated so well till the end . He went out of the way to help us to make us comfortable. We do appreciate his attitude and service.All others have to be trained well to welcome and treat all the customers equally . Their payroll doesn't say it's from white customers. It's a contribution of all the customers.Contact me on yelp for more information,92618

To my knowledge this location has never removed my favorite dish from the menu so they have me as a regular. The bar is nice while waiting for a table of you arrive at an extremely busy time. The indoor/outdoor seating option is great during the summer.The service we receive has always been top notch. If you suffer from allergies advise the server.

This is a typical Asian chain in America. The food is average. My main gripe is that I've come here many times with my friends (I'm Asian and some of my friends like Westernized Asian food) and whenever I order something that is a usual order, it doesn't always taste the same. Sometimes there's way too much soy sauce thrown on the noodles and sometimes it tastes fine.The appetizers are a rip off -- $5-6 just for four dumplings or three chicken satay skewers. Chicken is sometimes really dry. Dumplings were obviously frozen beforehand.You'll have your typical chain service and will probably be content but not amazed.",92618

Happy hour menu only offers two types of Jicama taco, however the regular menu has Shrimp/Crab one as well. Calamari was much better than the last time so I guess you could take your chances with it. Tried Chang's Ahi salad. Ingredients are great but dressing a bit too sweet. Great if you are into sweets. The Ahi was very fresh. I will order again but with dressing on the side. All together in my opinion, the food is catared for the nutural palet. Lastly, the very polite beautiful young lady helping us, was a bit in a hurry.

Although, dining in this restaurant proved to be disappointing. Service was fairly pleasant, and my waiter was nice to us the whole time. Also, the prices seemed to make up for the fact that it was family-styled dishes; yet, that became the more disappointing part of the experience. My party ordered one appetizer and two entrees, giving it about a thirty minute wait overall. It was not too bad of a wait, but it was kinda ridiculous knowing that the place was not busy at all.Appetizer was cooked well; entrees were not. One entree was too hard to chew. Portions were also way too small to be considered ""family-styled"" meals. You can literally save money by going to Panda Express and get more to eat.

Now I understand that some individuals may have been working all day and they are fairly tired. I get that BUT it's still no excuse for the lackluster service all around. There were maybe 4-5 tables in the whole restaurant, I know this because they already shut down the other side because they started their closing process. With that said, there were still 2 servers attending the area. We didn't take long to order, we got our drinks and began to wait FOREVER (30 mins plus) for 2 dishes. Not only did it take forever to get to the table but when it did, it was wrong. Like dead wrong. Ok, I've worked in customer service and I've worked in the food industry and I will not sit here and claim I've never made mistakes but come on. You make me wait all night and still get it wrong, at least let me wait for something that blew my mind! But no... it was a sad  attempt at Americanized Chinese and they couldn't have done worse.

PF Changs is this strange Asian amalgamation of Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese, and Thai inspired dishes. I think of them as an upper level Panda Express. They earned 3 stars from me because they were able to deliver solid service and decent atmosphere to go along with my fake Asian food. The food is what one would expect. Some sort of protein mixed with a cornstarch-thickened sauce, some veggies, and maybe chilies. For some reason, I really enjoyed their Sichuan asparagus as it had this nice blend of chilies and garlic. Avoid the hot at sour soup. It was much too salty and I will never order this again. I did enjoy the friendly and efficient service. Furthermore, while their tap selection only consisted of maybe 5 or 6 beers, they did try to include local craft beer. So props for that.",92618

This was a huge disappointment. First of all there was 5 chunks of ""BREADED"" lobster.... who breads lobster??? That makes me think that they are being shady and I could be eating everything, but I feel like there was no lobster taste if there was more than just a tiny piece of lobster in the breading. The steak was mixed in with other veggies. I found 4 pieces of meat. This is not a steak or even a kids amount.I ordered one drink and had to embarrassingly ask for it 3 times, and I had to ask 5 times for a lime. That is not an exaggeration, I may have asked more than that. The building looks nice, but the staff was unorganized. The service as well as the food has lost our business in the future.

I immediately proceeded to put my collar up and take my garlic pills. Our waitress came to take our order, we decided on the Kung Pao sushi roll (nothing Pao about it!) It wasn't terrible but it only had some crumpled up peanuts and Siracha sauce. Then we went with Buddha's feast (I'm not sure, but I think this meant Buddha was on some sort of hunger strike!) A few shavings of tofu with WAY too much broccoli, a few carrots, bell peppers, and ZERO flavor. The last dish we ordered was the Singapore Black pepper chicken (it was definitely POOR in flavor and quantity!) Barely anything for us to share or let alone taste. We left confused, scared, and amazed as to why this place has stood the test of time (it's probably because of the vampires) I'm convinced we were compelled by the time we had walked in without knowing!

Overall some of their chicken plates to me have came up short on taste. Example: The Balti Masala Chicken I had on my last visit the taste wasn't as bold as I thought. I mean overall the experience was average but with a little more spices to it, wouldn't hurt to make it have a long lasting masala flavor to the tip of the soul.To make it short and sweet...Cripsy Honey Chicken...is sweet..Seasame Chicken...is sweet...Can I get these from their home frozen food menu?...sweet? maybe the quality is similar  who knows? go to your grocery store nearest you.Anyways, I think their beef plates here are better than the chicken choices, and it sucks I could only chicken, but hey their Lettuce Wrap appetizer is always worth a try here.

Definitely recommend this if you are looking for something lightly filling with a bit of freshness from the lettuce. We also paired this with a cup of Egg Drop Soup.  DEFINITELY have to get the soup! It was so good. It was tempting for me to get a whole bowl of it (which served 6). Get the soup! For our entree, we got the Spicy lobster and shrimp fried rice, which was all right. There was a few pieces of lobster and several crispy shrimps on a bed of fried rice. I wouldn't say that this dish was super delicious, but rather good for what it is.

Chang's in a decade.  I went once, and that was enough for me.  But I happened to be at The Spectrum with my parents and when reviewing the options for dinner they decided on Changs.  I was hesitant, but in the end this visit really turned my former opinion completely on it's head.   Let's start by saying that I doubt that my meal would have been anywhere as enjoyable if it hadn't been for our server, Brandon.  Great personality, upbeat and really showed a willingness to help out.  My parents asked a bunch of questions, mostly regarding heat level as my mom can't eat spicy food, and he leveled with us saying that he would check with the kitchen and if it wasn't possible he would let us know.  He even offered to leave off the sriracha on half of our sushi roll after all this spicy talk when we didn't ask about it.  Then came our meals and they were really delicious.  My dad said his pad thai was one of the best he'd had, my Buddha's feast was full of crisp veggies in a yummy sauce, but my mom's eggplant took the cake.  This was the dish that was supposed to be spicy, but the flavor of the sauce was so delicious on it's own I would hesitate to order it as is in the future.  (But would definitely want to try it hot) All in all, I don't think P.F. Chang's is life changing food, and while it has been redeemed for me, I wouldn't rush out to go again, although I might be tempted to uber eats that eggplant, is that a thing?) But I really wanted to write this review to let the management know how great Brandon was, so hopefully someone sees this and gives him a high five for me, or you know, a raise.",92618

The shrimp tasted and looked defrosted, like those samples they give at Costco. No pun intended, I love Costco, I just hate frozen food. Then my wife and I shared the Kung Pao shrimp and the spicy changs chicken, we also ordered the street noodles, these food reminded me of the old reheated Chinese food from Panda Express after the lunch rush.

Like really REALLY unique. I got the pad Thai, and I was absolutely amazed at how different it was from other places. There's a bunch of citrus in it, and they even give you an extra lime slice. I fucking love lime/lemon on everything, so it was an absolute joy.Service was pretty bad for this place though. I asked for a couple minutes to look at the menu. I expected to wait for maybe 3-5 minutes, but I ended up waiting for 10 in the empty restaurant. Nobody came by at all in that timespan too. When I was ready to pay too, the waiter just ran over, placed a dessert menu, and power walked away before I could even ask for the check. More waiting ensued.Prices are really high too, since it's a ""classy"" place. I came here alone to eat lunch, but it's a pretty good date spot.Overall, I'd come back for the interesting takes on Asian food, but the prices and service are keeping me away.

I did not like it. Maybe this doesn't reflect the entire restaurant's overall rating, but why promote something that doesn't taste great? It was dry to be honest. The only thing I liked was that it filled our stomachs when we were hungry. If I ever go back, sushi is the last thing I'll order. I do not plan on spending money for that sushi. It surprised me since P. F. Chang's name is so big and well-known. I'll try something else though. Maybe next time.",92618

It was a big group of us that went for a birthday party on a Friday night, luckily they take reservations and since half of our party was there they seated us right away which was great. Our waitress in the beginning was pretty prompt taking our drink orders and getting our appetizers in, however, when our appetizers got to the table the didn't bring us plates, so our food sat there for roughly 10 mins till we were able to flag someone down to bring us plates. We ordered the lettuce wraps and they were good once we finally got to eat them. For dinner, two of the couples ordered the prix fix menu for 2 and the rest of us ordered other items off the menu, which turned out great because we all shared everything. All items on the menu state it comes with rice, however, what the brought out didn't seem enough for 7 people. The food overall was ok, nothing really stood out, the service could've been better and the ambience of the restaurant is nice but I'd rather skip the ambience and just get Chinese food from a 2 item combo joint.",92618

However, tonight, if I could give the service 0 stars, I would. We planned to go out for dinner tonight and had made a reservation for 7 pm. We arrived promptly around ten minutes before our reservation time, and the hostess told us to wait until it was closer to our reservation time. It seemed a little weird since people are usually able to serve you around then, but fine. We took a seat to the side and waited. When it hit 7:00, there was no sign from the hostesses that they were even going to make an effort to seat us. Typically, I would have assumed that if they knew someone was waiting for their reservation at that time, then someone would stop by and give an update. Instead, they just stood around and chatted with themselves. My sister went up to ask for an update and the girl didn't even bother to look at her nor give her an estimate of how much longer we would need to wait. After waiting for thirty minutes, we decided to leave because it seemed they didn't care enough for our business to make sure that we had the answers that we needed as to when we were going to be seated. Plus, we were starving. If you can't honor a reservation (or at least provide a reasoning as to why you can't), then don't bother allowing reservations to begin with.",92618

He was helpful and very respectful! Food - Cecilia's pork dumplings - the dough was thick and tough, hot and sour soup - spicy but otherwise not too flavorful, walnut shrimp with melon - tasted too much of mayonnaise, pepper steak - was not marked as a spicy dish but was quite hot.

We had the pork dumplings, pan fried & combo fried rice. A lot of people added steamed broccoli to their rice which I would do next time. I would try the dumplings steamed because they were a little bit oily. You can ""request"" the sauces on the side and have it mixed as mild or spicy as you like.

Our server was overwhelmed with the amount of tables she had to cover. Even if 1 person did not come in, 2 people could not efficiently handle all the patio area tables. If they were not prepared to offer the new menu they should not have, it's not my fault i ordered it, they offered it.When the meal finally came it was cold. My dish had cold white rice, not brown. I have been to this location several times over the years and service has always been marginal. This time terrible and i will never go back. No compensation by the manager on the food bill.

It doesn't sound as good as it tastes. Just trust me on this one, you just have to try it. You can NEVER go wrong by ordering the Oolong Sea Bass.

The final straw was the appetizer - I ordered a California Roll - simple, easy - right?  Have you ever made the mistake of buying a California Roll at a gas station or 7-11?  You may remember how the rice tastes wooden, the crab like, well, something unrecognizable.  No matter how hungry, you regret purchasing it.  Well, and I swear, they served the same quality California Roll, tasteless, stale and, you guessed it, some syrupy base underneath each individual roll.  A total bust.The positive side was the greeters and serving staff - very welcoming and hospitable.  I felt really good visiting the restaurant.  However, the food served made a food court in the local mall a better option.  I certainly hope someone meets with the kitchen staff and figures out what in the world they are doing back there.",92618

Sent it back, which is extremely rare for me.Service was great, no complaints at all. Kudos to Zach and the rest of the staff.So why is this a 1 star? Because 3 of the 5 of us ended up with really upset stomachs. And by upset stomachs, I mean sitting on the toilet 3 times in 3 hours immediately after eating (and once in the morning for good measure), getting up to throw up multiple times at night for multiple people - the works. We suspect it might have been the green beans, but can't really be sure, and if it was, no clue what ingredient would have caused it. Or maybe it was bad silverware? But seeing as how 2 of us didn't really eat anything else during the day, this place was the culprit. So despite the great service and reasonable drink prices, there is absolutely NO CHANCE I'm ever coming back to PF Chang's. Stay away unless praying to the porcelain gods is your thing.",92618

I was asking her about my check and the things I ordered to make sure it was correct and she was very rude and gave me a quick disgusted look and turned her head away to the restaurant and she didn't seem to be trying to answer my questions.

Even if I wasn't ethnically offended, the food here is bland, too sweet, and not even what's promised in the menu. The surf and turf breaded the shrimp and sad tiny single piece of lobster for no reason and paired it with what tasted like poorly cut (I.e. With the grain) flank steak that the menu says is filet mignon. The ""crispy"" honey chicken should be renamed ""soggy fried bread with small bits of flavorless chicken sprinkled in"". Salmon was dry, but relative to the other dishes, actually contained salmon. The hokkien noodles were actually decent but nothing to rave about and, as with everything else here, overpriced. One last thing, why would anyone name a dessert ""good fortune cheesecake"" with no description. Blueberry cheesecake would have been fine, no need to come up with an awful stereotype to make cheesecake sound exotic. Decor is nice, service wasn't bad, but the food just doesn't make sense. Why does Asian food have to be bad to cater to Caucasian customers? Maybe bad food is ""exotic""?",92618

That is where we went wrong. Flies EVERYWHERE! We witnessed 3 tables move to tables inside and the rest of the customers fought flies off during the duration of their entire meal. (We had to put napkins over our dishes to keep from pests landing). I'm not one to write bad reviews, but it was BAD!! Like sitting in a horse stable bad. All the servers and food runners turned a blind eye whenever they would walk by and see people fending off the flies.The food was good and our server was sweet and apologetic at the end, but it was still unacceptable how BAD the fly problem is. (***not to mention the ladies restroom was empty of toilet paper***)I don't know if the outside isn't being well kept or there isn't any prevention being done, but I know we never had any problems sitting outside last summer when a gentleman named Brandon was managing.

I came here in the mood for Asian cuisine and I walked away rather disappointed. We ordered the lettuce wraps to start off which were delicious, however the Buddhas feast I ordered was a lot smaller and the sauce used was rather bland and unappealing. The ginger chicken with broccoli was equally disappointing since the broccoli was served raw and not even cooked.Maybe it was what we ordered but for the price we paid, I think we would have been happier having gone to Panda Express or their other counterpart, Pei Wei.We did speak to the manager, Circon however, who was very professional and a sweetheart. He took care of us, offering to remake the items but alas, we just didn't want to bother. I'll give them another shot but might not order the same next time.

Last night my man and I decided to come here for dinner since we had a gift card. The wait? An hour and a half, of course. It was a Friday night, what else could we expect? Fine, we waited it out. They weren't kidding either, we waited closer to two hours. And when we left at about 9:30 PM there were still loads of people inside and outside waiting for a table. Crazy.Once seated, everything was great. Our server was amazing, the food was out quickly, everything tasted very good. At least they take good care of you after making you wait so long.We started with the Bang Bang Chicken Flatbread, and I also had a cup of Egg Drop Soup. The soup was great, I always like their Egg Drop Soup. The Flatbread was not my favorite thing. It was more like a cracker, not bread, and the sauce on it was kind of peanuty or something. Anyways, BF was a huge fan, while one piece was enough for me.While we waited for our entrees, they brought us some Spring Rolls on the house - they said they made an extra order on accident. Whatever the reason, they were good, and it's nice that they were free.For dinner we ordered the Beef Lo Mein - I personally LOVE their pan fried noodles, but since this location has ""revamped"" everything, the menu is different, and they didn't offer those. The Lo Mein was a bit sticky and kind of flavorless. A few drops of soy sauce and I was in business. The beef strips were seasoned and cooked well.We also ordered Chang's Spicy Chicken - cubed pieces of white meat chicken with a spicy sweet glaze like sauce. These were really good, also very spicy.Lastly we ordered the Crispy Honey Shrimp. Perfect texture, light and crunchy, great flavor. Definitely the favorite dish of the evening.When we paid the bill we were given two envelopes to celebrate Chinese New Year. They contain coupons of some sort (10% off, 50% off, free appetizers, etc...) that we can bring back before mid-March and get a discount. I think we will definitely use those, but probably on a weeknight since I don't really want to wait two hours again.",92618

We waited about 20 minutes mean while taking a stroll to Sees Candies for some lollipops! It was perfect time as we got back we got seated. We were seated next to a party of four that kept looking at us for some reason like we were invading their area lol. Anyway, our waiter was Matt. Customer Service: Matt was polite when we arrived but my BF asked about some appetizer tacos and he made a good recommendation but I told my BF I wouldn't be eating any because we always order too much food wherever we go, we are small framed people and not to mention seated at a tiny table. When Matt returned he moved the big candle directly in front of my face where I needed space to eat my dinner and left it there. I was a bit shocked and felt uncomfortable by that. I think Matt may have gotten annoyed because of that so the rest of the night proceeded to ONLY look at and speak with my BF and completely ignore me. I didn't believe I was being rude to him at all I was being honest with my BF and saying he can order that taco dish for himself if he can finish it along with his entree dish. I understand things may be busy but in those few minutes you see customer I would think you would try your best to be nice. I couldn't help thinking what a jerk he was for that. I suddenly started to get into an unhappy mood over this experience. He also brought me a water with something floating in it...Anyway, a nice guy named Trevor (of whom had the best attitude and changed my mood) brought our entree dishes in which we ordered a Changs Spicy Chicken Plate along with Pepper Steak to share with a bowl of brown rice. I liked the chicken dish better than the pepper steak but both were decent. I have four stars since my BF loved the food somehow and he's a picky one lol. Otherwise I would've rated 3 stars.Back to just Trevor, he was definitely a spark at this restaurant. Positive attitude, enthusiastic and funny! I was secretly wishing WHY couldn't HE be our waiter of the night? Lol but he said he was a back waiter so he's trying to work his way up. If I owned a business I would snatch him up and offer him a job myself. He was so passionate about work and life in general. On our way out I observed this young man manager in a button up and tie and saw him make his rounds through the entire restaurant making sure everything was smoothly running. He reminded me of my BF, hard working. I caught him right before the door to personally give kind words about Trevor. The manager was super friendly and polite. Overall, I would've give only 2 stars for this but added 2 more for the great attitudes of Trevor & his manager and also because my BF enjoyed the food here. So there we go 4 stars it is!

For dinner, it's always gonna be at least a 40 min wait on the weekends since it's at the spectrum. However I had a pretty bad experience last night. Our server sucked so bad.. She said she would be right with us and ended up helping 100 other tables so we waited 15 min jus to order. Every time we needed something, it took ages to get done. I really wished it was more of a Chinese style restaurant where you can ask any server for help instead of waiting to ask one person when there's so many employees walking around. We usually get the pf changs for 2 where you get a 3 course meal for 2 ppl for $40, but we weren't too hungry so we decided to just get 2 entrees. When it came out, I was so disappointed. $15 for each plate and the portions were TINY!!!!! Sucha rip off. I was still so hungry afterwards I could've eaten a burger! But I didn't..

As soon as you walk in those huge wooden double doors, you'll know your money is going towards the ambiance and not the food. It has recently been renovated with dark wood furniture all over the place. Dimly lit, it adds a dramatic feel when you're dining here. I won't argue that it's pretty inside. As for the food, we got LETTUCE WRAPS and DYNAMITE SHRIMP for starters. Between the two, the shrimp was my fave. Lightly battered and deep fried, it is then smothered with some sweet spicy sauce that has a nice heat to it. The wraps were just ok. I had a taste and had no interest in it after. We also ordered EGG DROP SOUP and HOT & SOUR SOUP. The egg drop soup was alright, nothing outstanding, while their hot & sour soup had way too much soy sauce. It was all I could taste. Gross!HONEY CHICKEN (ok), BEEF WITH BROCCOLI (ok), ORANGE PEEL CHICKEN (no thanks), KOREAN WINGS (ok),  and SHRIMP IN LOBSTER SAUCE (no thanks)  were the main courses. They were all mediocre in taste and appearance to me. The orange peel chicken tasted nothing like what an orange chicken should taste. Their version has no sweet glaze so it's dry and over-seasoned with soy sauce. Can't taste any hint of orange in there. The shrimp in lobster sauce was just salty. No, thanks indeed! Their main courses come with rice (white or brown). I ended up eating lots of rice to balance out all that sodium. Being a chain, the only advantage is the fact that they can accommodate large parties. Otherwise, you can forget about the quality of service and food.",92618

I decided to sit at the bar in an area right in front of the bartenders. I sat there for a few minutes before they even acknowledged me. The one bartender cleaned the area in front of me and ask what I wanted to drink. I asked for a water. The bartenders went back to what ever conversation was more important than the customer. I had to ask for the water a second time. I ordered the roll and waited. The seat next to me wasn't cleaned until about 15 minutes after I I arrived. I don't know what s/he ordered, but whatever was left over did not look appetizing at all.  One of the managers came by and I flagged her down to voice my displeasure at the bartenders caring more about the conversation than the customer.Finally the California Roll arrived. It was cold and tasted like the type of roll that was sitting around the supermarket all day. To make it worse, I bit into something hard in one of the pieces. I spit it out and notified the bartender. He noticed it was an avocado stem. They offered to replace the roll, but considering how bad it was, I turned down the offer. If this is typical of their rolls, they need to fire the sushi chef.I've been to this location at least 3 times in the past year. Usually the service is fine and the food acceptable.

She made no attempt to welcome us or discuss their menu. After we ordered we waited. And waited. And waited. We were both starving at this point. We saw people that came after us get served much before us. Finally after being ignored for a long time (our waitress never came to give us an update), the manager showed up and told us he had no clue where our food had gone and they would get started on our order right away. It took well over an hour to get our dinner. That was way too long, especially for an empty restaurant. By the time our food got there we gobbled it up so fast we hardly had time to enjoy it. The food itself was really tasty so it's disappointing that the experience was so bad.There was never an apology, or even a mention, from the waitress, and there was no attempt to try to make up for it either. If I were the manager there I would try to do something to keep the customer happy knowing we had made a mistake. I would have offered an appetizer while the entree was being made or given a small discount. The point is doing something to try to remove the bad taste left in our mouths because of their errors.

Does your boss know you just lost a $400 client? The front receptionist is the face of your whole business. And this girl did Changs no justice.

The hot and sour soup came out first, and was pretty tasty.  Lately I have been having cravings for hot  and sour soup, something I have not eaten in probably 15 years. Of the 3 places I have eaten it lately, this was the best tasting. The lettuce wraps came out with everyone else's food. One HUGE bummer is that they do not make the sauce for you anymore. I don't know when they stopped doing that, as I have not been here in quite some time.  It is now just a generic sauce. No spice, no kick.  I liked being able to make it spicy, or more vinegary. We also didn't have the same server our entire meal.  I didn't know who was our actually server.  A different person took our drink orders, from our food orders, and someone else brought us our food.  Strange. No idea what this meal cost, since my dad picked up the tab. My guess would be that it was not worth the price.",92618

Service was fine, as was the wine and beer. Lunch came in fair time. It went downhill from there. Crispy green beans soggy, greasy tasteless. Mongolian pot stickers, Deep fried and flat?????? Looks like no pot sticker I've ever seen, hard and tasteless. Veg. spring roll, looked fine but tasteless. Spicy tuna Ahi roll, What !???, it came in a bowl, tasteless tuna tasteless everything. Sweet sour chicken, dry tough also almost tasteless. Thank God for the beer. Pork dumpling Same as above. Kung Pao Dragon roll, also same as above. These are only what I can recall any of the others. Way over priced for such low quality, I feel bad for the serving staff they are first on the firing line and in many cases their tips are at stake. Despite the enormous bill our server is not the blame, he got the 20% and he deserved he had to suffer the embarrassing food quality. It appears that P.J. Chang is deep in the franchise doldrums.

During the 20 minute wait we saw 2 parties be seated in the patio that just walked in. I spoke with the manager and they did not seem to care at all. I do not recommend this location.

485,"514 Spectrum Center Dr Irvine, CA 92618",Danielle F.,"Huntington Beach, CA",10/17/2015,2,"NEVER COMING BACK!Just left pf chang's and I've been complaining since I was seated. We contemplated leaving after we were seated because although they sent the text message saying our seats were ready they attempted to sit us at the bar (if I wanted to sit there I would have walked in and sat myself instead of waiting for them to tell me a seat was ready. After that the hostess walked us back to the entrance TWICE after the seats she was planning on giving us were no longer available. After finally being seated we ordered the first round of drinks and an appetizer. I will admit these were out promptly. The problem was that my Long Island didn't look or taste like a Long Island. After the waiter took our order & we asked for a second round of drinks (which took forever) I received my food without my rice. We didn't see the waiter until about 30 mins later when our second round of drinks came. This is when I asked for my rice TWO MORE TIMES after I ordered it  (which I still hadn't gotten). & we hadn't touched my food until I got my rice. By this time my food was cold. Finally got my rice and was glad to eat. Sure the food was good, but definitely not worth the hassle we had been put through. The food was the only reason I rated 2 stars instead of one. Oh another thing I need to say is that the prices on the menu were in fact different from the prices that we were charged on the bill... One last thing. We were seated in the patio area. An older couple sat next to us and a waitress took their drink order and brought them drinks. About 10 minutes later a manager or someone comes up to them and tells them that they can't sit there & they have a 40 minute wait. She told them they could sit by a fire pit or at the bar or high tables  AFTER THEY HAD ALREAY BEEN SERVED. They moved as she requested & then they left after their wine instead of ordering food as they intended. I couldn't tell what was worse. Treating people like that in a service industry OR after they leave not seating anyone there for about 30 minutes. Well it seems like they lost more than one patron that night. Need I continue ? Nope. This is why we'll NEVER COME AGAIN",92618

Chang's is different from another I went to but the selection wasn't as good on the menu.  The last time I went was 2000's and it was really good back then.  I don't know why they changed the menu.  The food was okay but I think I chose the wrong thing on the menu.  I saw some other choices on the menu that looked better.  I'll definitely visit again,92618
488,"514 Spectrum Center Dr Irvine, CA 92618",Trina D.,"Orange County, CA",12/16/2009,1,"P.F. Chang's is one of those places that has been around because some people are too lazy to seek out the real thing.  That's right, I said it.  The food is hardly authentic.  In fact, it's down right salty.  Sadly, my boss took us out to lunch and chose P.F. Chang's because they took reservations for a small party.  So, instead of ordering a rice dish, I ordered the seared Ahi tuna.  Don't ask me why, they would serve this dish at a ""Chinese"" restaurant, but it was on the menu so I ordered it.  The Ahi was served rare, but instead of a bright reddish pink color, I was greeted with a dull pink.  The fish was rubbed in a 5-spice blend prior to searing and served sliced with a splash of spicy mustard sauce.  It was ok, but I've had better.  I'm not a big fan of mustard and most of my friends know that I'm not into wasabi either.  The mixed bed of greens was dressed in a light vinegarette.  The dish overall was light on the palette and perfect for lunch.  I also ordered a side of spicy green beans and a cup of hot and sour soup to compliment my meal.  I must say that it is nice that they offer brown rice since the white rice is so dry and oddly disgusting.  After lunch I had a big headache, so I suspect they use MSG in their food as well.  Another thing that I despise about chain restaurants is how incredibly busy they become during the lunch hour.  It gives them the option of packing an entire dining room full of people, yet they are unable to serve everyone properly.  Our server did her best but she disappeared for large amounts of time and was slow to bring us our check.  I've had better food and better service at smaller scale restaurants.  It's not worth the visit.  In fact, you can get similar food at their casual dining venture, Pei Wei.  So save your cash and go elsewhere, anywhere!",92618

There was an unmistakable hint of fishiness.  And the dish cost $24.95!!  And why did I rate them 3 stars instead of something lower?  BC I believe that had I brought this issue to their attention,  they were the type who would correct it by offering another dish at no extra charge.  (Or charge me the price of the replacement dish only.)  I wish I had done that but I was not sure at that time.  I did not have enough sleep and I think I had too much wine (it was a huge glass, remember?)  We watched a movie after dinner and after the movie, I asked my cousin if she noticed the fishiness (bc she had a bite).  And without hesitation, she said yes.Until now, I NEVER had fish that was fishy from any high-caliber restaurants as what I believe PF Changs aspires to be.CONCLUSIONNext time, I'm just going to order the PF Chang-Fried- Rice Combo and the Calamari.",92618

GREAT, she's going to deliver THAT order before giving me my credit card back.  FANTASTIC. Makes sense, I gave her my credit card and she disappears for a while, probably waiting for that order to be finished.2 things need to happen here: 1. Get that handheld credit card authorization machine for quick paymnet2.

It was as if they poured the salt on it without the filter.  I never got a real taste of what it tasted like because of the salt.  I also think there should have been a warning of how spicy it was.  I don't like spicy food at all but  I can tolerate some spice but not to the point where your mouth is on fire and even water or juice doesn't help.  I ended up giving it to my husband and he cancelled his order and finished mine.  I went to CPK and grabbed something. I wasn't happy with the food because of the extreme use of salt and believe me I use lots of salt when I cook but this was excessive to the point where it was totally unenjoyable.   I don't believe in complaining or sending things back to the kitchen I make the best out of it.  The thing is the quality of food was good and I know that if the salt wasn't so drastic it would have been a delicious meal.  So next time I go there I will know how to special order my food because I wold like to try the rice again.  So to sum it up it was a nice place to dine.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  It was clean and so were the bathrooms.  Food had the potential to be the best meal I have had in a long time without the salt and I will not get any big priced fancy drops of a drink. :)",92618

The Chef Special is their crispy beef that they glaze with red bell peppers and asparagus. I believe this used to be on the menu, but they took it off for whatever reason. But, you can still order it as the ""Crispy Beef Chef Special.""  Service was good and the ambience was very pleasant (they think they recently remodeled the restaurant).",92618

525,"514 Spectrum Center Dr Irvine, CA 92618",Marika D.,"Henderson, NV",5/30/2015,1,"Came here on Memorial Day. It was my boyfriend's birthday and he liked this place so we decided to have dinner here. It was a little crowded, but we got seated right away which was nice. It took a little while for them to bring our waters, but we were pretty hungry and focused on the menu anyway. We opted for the 2 person full course menu (whatever it's called) deciding that was a good deal and perfect for the occasion.Well, it took over 30 minutes just for the soup to come out. My hot and sour soup was more like a luke-warm and mild soup, but unfortunately this was probably the best part of the meal. The pork dumplings were dry and tasted like the ones you buy in the frozen aisle at grocery stores. The sauce it came with helped it out a little though.Then another while of waiting and finally our entrees come out. We got the Dan Dan Noodles and Ginger Pork with broccoli. A few bites in, and we're even more frustrated. The Dan Dan noodles were seriously cooked to mush. The broccoli in the ginger pork was extremely undercooked. So, of course, when the waiter asks us how everything is, we tell him the noodles are overcooked and the broccoli is undercooked. So he tells us he will fix this. Another period of waiting...He brings back the dishes. Thankfully, they fixed the broccoli issue. But the noodles were EXACTLY THE SAME, if not worse. I mean come on. I expect a chain restaurant to at least meet the standards of cooking/service. How are you going to overcook noodles twice in a row? The waiter told us it's because they put a hot sauce over the noodles after they're done, cooking them even more. Well then if you know that, undercook them a little before you put the sauce on...duh? The only somewhat tasty item was the ginger pork, but our appetite was so spoiled that we could barely enjoy it. By the time our dessert came, we just wanted to get out of there. It had already been a total of 2 hours since we sat down. We left super annoyed, and the overall experience was just a waste of time and money. I felt really bad since I was hoping to have a nice date with my boyfriend on his birthday.Maybe it was a bad chef that night. Who knows. But if you're going to mess up twice on the same thing, at least give us a discount or offer something to make up for it. If you want customers to return, you've got to make them happy. Unfortunately, PF Changs, you lost my business.",92618
526,"514 Spectrum Center Dr Irvine, CA 92618",LaLa G.,"Newport Beach, CA",1/1/2016,1,"My nice friend & I came up to the bar  to sit down and have a snack before the movie. The female bartender immediately said ""Those seats are taken""--then laughed and said she was kidding. Very impolite. Later, a kinder male bartender took care of us. We had food too, kind of mediocre--chicken lettuce wraps not good. Hair in the food. The fried green beans were pretty good. After a couple left who had been eating, a guy next to me wedged in (it wasn't crowded) to have a beer withhis friend. He was pushing me (as I was eating) which is weird because it's 5:30 and not that crowded--there were other spots to sit/stand. When I turned around to look at him, he just shrugged and put his elbow out. I might expect that at a dive bar late night, but not at a family restaurant. The male/female bathrooms are so close guys run into you in the way out. One guy was still zipping up his pants. Not very appetizing.",92618

THEY do Hot & Sour soup way better than here.Recently, my company ordered catering/togo orders for us so we got to choose what we wanted.I got the Caramel Mango Chicken since I like Mangos and it sounded decent. You also get a choice of soup and type of rice which I chose Hot & Sour and Brown Rice.Pic: yelp.com/biz_photos/pf-c…Do you see how DARK the soup is? It was SO salty! Seriously thick, and after a couple sips I couldn't finish.For my entree, I expected more.... something. Just unsatisfying chicken with a couple diced chunks of mango here and there.So for people who need to do lunch meetings, please go somewhere else.And if you ever need to do corporate catering, AVOID.

Further inside there was plenty of seating that's also outside for people to enjoy the warm and sunny Southern California weather. I started with a Left Coast Trestles IPA on draft. Not a bad beer, but their beer selection isn't that great unless you're fine drinking cheap domestic beers. We ordered a bunch of the food from the happy hour menu: Ahi Tartare with Avocado, Orange Ginger Edamame, Chang's Chicken Lettuce Wraps, and Chicken Satay skewers. It was by no means anywhere near authentic Chinese food, but everything that we ordered besides the Chicken Satay skewers were decent. The one item that I thought was the most interesting was the Orange Ginger Edamame. It was a bit salty, but the flavor was not bad. A very interesting combination!",92618

I also love the flamboyant bartender (maybe there are more than one... The one I really like is tall, Caucasian, good looking and works weekday evenings). Anyway, they are both really friendly.Aside from them, the servers all seem like high schoolers, or adults who are still stuck in high school, that don't care about their jobs. Super slow, attitude, unapologetic. Seriously unimpressed with the staff here.Mostly I am upset that the happy hour menu changed and now the beer prices have gone up and the vegetarian options have come off. Before I could get veggie spring rolls, tempura green beans or edamame on happy hour special but now it is only edamame.Anyway, won't be coming here anymore. It isn't worth it at this point since happy hour now gives me only $1 off regular priced edamame.I'd rather sit in traffic than deal with the crappy staff here and pay more than I was before for the same darn thing.",92618

The first time I came here was last year and we were sat outside by the bar and the waiter forgot about us. He only saw us to take our order, never refilled our water and another person dropped off the check and food. The food was ok, but when we got our dessert, there was cardboard in the middle of it and we cut into the big chocolate peanut butter crunch cake and I pulled a huge chuck of cardboard out of my mouth. I spoke with the manager and he comped our meals, as he should have.I went there again last week with my inlaws and the service was better, however the food was AWFUL! The crab wontons tasted SUPER fishy, the honey chicken was soggy and cold, and the mongolian beef was really thick and dry. We ordered chocolate wontons for dessert. Took about 30 minutes and it was 2 measly tiny little bites. Everything was luke warm, awful, and tasteless. We were served a dirty appetizer plate with crusted food. and two sets of silverware where the napkin had dried food on it. We were also sat at a handicapped booth (plenty of seats were open) and the table was up to our chin. Fortunately we were moved to a more appropriate table.  Other PF Changs are great, but I am not sure if the chef just doesn't care, or is not trained properly.

After four bites it was too sweet and the quality of meat seemed fatty. With tip I spent almost $20. I expected better.

We ordered appetizers-the tempura green beans were outstanding. We requested that the sauce for the tempura cauliflower be put on the side, a good call since it was much too spicy for our tastes, although it was very flavorful for those who like it hot. The chicken lettuce wraps were delicious, with the perfect amount of sauce. For dinner, we shared the Combo Lo Mein, Honey Crisp Chicken and Shrimp, Mongolian Beef, Broccoli Beef, and Ginger Chicken. I don't need to describe them all, suffice it to say that every one was delicious!  We sampled a number of the specialty desserts, they were rich, but the perfect size. Even those who don't care for cheesecake or blueberries loved the Blueberry Cheesecake.  But our group's consensus was that the Coconut Ice Cream was the BEST!!  The highlight of our evening was the staff. Our server, Deck, who managed our spirited group with great humor, and willingly split the check as we asked. At the end of our meal, Deck and Brianna packed up our leftovers, and Brianna actually packed our precious Coconut Ice Cream in a plastic bag with ice, to assure that it got home successfully. We have visited other P. F. Chang's before, but this is by far the best. We will be back!",92618

Level of complaints at restaurants is low.I feel we are experts at eating out, especially with a toddler. We have always had a somewhat awesome experience at PF Chang's and that has kept us coming back regularly the past three years. However, tonight's experience was enough to make anyone think twice about coming here...We had a reservation at six. We were seated promptly . They were out of children's menus. They were out of children's cups so they gave our two year old a glass with a straw. They refused to give us our usual order since it was not included on the PFChangs for Two. Nevermind that we've gotten it every other time. Some idiot came over and joked ""it's not my decision... "" and ""the food will still taste the same haha."" We didn't get to actually order until 10 mins later. Waitress often MIA. Food was cold when it arrived, rice didn't arrive till our meal was almost done, and the ultimate:  we ordered our fav. dessert,  the banana spring rolls and they don't mention they are out of ice cream so the waitress just assumes we'll forget about that part and serves it like that without a word. Really? We asked. Yes, they were out. Might want to let people know before they order.There was more. But I'll leave it at that. Terrible terrible fail. That is how a business fails. Hard. :(",92618

I asked for a different booth then realized they were all like this.  The hostess said oh we are getting those fixed March 28.   Now this condition didn't  happen over night.  The cushions should been fixed long ago.   You would think a restaurant that tries to portray an image of quality would try a lot harder.,92618

I'm not sure I even know the difference. But all I know is P F Chang's food was delicious. We started out with an order of California rolls that in my opinion were real fresh tasting. And though this might sound funny, I loved the size of them. Some places make them so big and fat that they fall apart when you try to eat them. Not here! They were a mouth full yet still a bite size.I had the Sweet & Sour Chicken that I thoroughly loved. There were small chunks of some sort of vegetable I couldn't recognize but found it so scrumptious that I was about ready to request just a plate of that.My wife had the Walnut Shrimp with Melon Balls. and in her own words, ""This is so delicious, it melts in my mouth!""All in all it was a pleasant dining experience, though I'm not sure I would be able to afford a $75.00 dinner every night of the week.Gary",92618

We were greeted at the door and waited about 10 minutes for a table. As we got seated we were close enough to the kitchen to randomly hear the servers saying things under their breath to one another? It was like they were all fighting that night. After 10 minutes of waiting one of the waitresses finally came to our table. We ordered drinks and food all at once. 10 minutes later here come our drinks and promptly after our food. We both had orders of orange chicken and 2 appetizers. The veggie eggrolls where weirdly undercooked inside, the mushrooms were tough. The crab wontons we could've passed on, skip it. Probably because the menu said it came with plum sauce but instead we were served sweet chili. Orange chicken was hot but the sauce had a skin to it so I assume it had been waiting to be served for a while. Throughout the entire meal we had to constantly look around for our waitress and flag her down for more drinks. She had red hair and winged liner. I think we worked harder than she did, WE had to work to get HER attention. Got the bill and we left. Should have gone to Javier's or even Cheesecake Factory.",92618

The ambiance is nice and trendy, but is in no way, shape, or form intimate. It's loud. But you know what IS intimate? Their fish bowls. We opted for the mai tai fish bowl, which we were told is the strongest one. For food, we got the prix-fixe menu that includes an appetizer, two entrees, and a dessert; this meant pork dumplings, garlic noodles, pepper steak, and tiramisu.The dumplings were surprisingly tasty and a bit spicy. The garlic noodles were nothing to rave about, the pepper steak had a spicy tomato-based sauce that was actually pretty delish. The tiramisu doesn't have marscapone, but rather just straight whipped cream. Yes please. In what I assume was an effort to expedite table turnover, the server brought us our dessert and bill before we finished our entrees. I thought it was tacky.

Chang's Mai Tai.  Great price as it was $17 and was the equivalent of 2 1/2 drinks at $9 each.  It was delicious.My other half and I shared the for two for $19.95 per person meal.  This comes with an appetizer to share, a small bowl of soup for each, your choice of two entrees and a dessert to share.  We decided on Kashmir wok seared lamb, egg drop soup, sweet and sour chicken and pepper steak and for dessert, chocolate cinnamon pudding.  All were exceptionally delicious.  Kashmir wok seared lamb:  tasty but a bit on the very spicy side, but I'm a weakling when it comes to spicy.  It was actually more reminiscent of Indian food, rather than Chinese.  It could have used more of the bread.Sweet and sour chicken and pepper steak:  both wonderful and love that the chicken is breast, no veins and no fatty or wierd pieces.  Same goes for the steak, must higher quality of beef, and you don't have to chew a million times.Chocolate cinnamon pudding:  awesome!  Really enjoyed this new to the menu dessert.  A dark and dense chocolate pudding, with hints of cinnamon, not underwhelming, nor overpowering.  Fresh whipped cream on top.Service was great, friendly and for the most part, quick.  Our waiter was also very knowledgeable about the menu.  We had 7:00 pm reservations (yes they take reservations, both phone and online), had to wait about 10 minutes or so to be seated.  It was a Saturday night and it was packed, with a bunch of crazy-stupid people who didn't have reservations and were willing to wait almost 2 hours!  Yes you heard right, 2 hours.  I love P.F. Changs, but I'm not waiting 2 hours.  So there is a tip, be smart, make reservations.",92618

608,"514 Spectrum Center Dr Irvine, CA 92618",Dani B.,"Laguna Beach, CA",3/9/2014,2,"I've been here.. roughly.. 150 times. Yep you read that right. Why? The crispy honey chicken. It's also very close to my Cali home. I'm a girl and I get cravings.150 times but you give it 2 stars? Not for the food, it's for the service. If you eat in, I would say the experience is 4-star deserving (long wait times and inconsistent text messaging systems knocking a star off - not to mention a lot of open tables with a long wait time.. kind of a bad combo). It's curbside that is the issue. I usually order online using the iPhone app, and then add 20 mins to whatever time it says food will be ready. I get there, call, and am usually told it will be  another ""few minutes"", which invariably is over 10 more minutes (added to the 20 additional minutes I added to the app estimated time). I've adopted this approach: If your curbside order is late just call every 3 mins because they likely forgot about you or the squeaky wheel gets the grease.. I'm not sure which. Who knows what's ended up in my food as a result. Most inefficient curbside in history of curbside's. The service here would last 30 seconds in NYC before someone would lose it. They need to institute remote credit card systems, and add a lot more help for the curb. Plain and simple. Charge a small fee if you want! Many of us tip curbsider's a lot because we know they often get stiffed. I'm sure it's not the curb-sider's fault. But it's far past ridiculous and bordering on insane. Some of my friends call 10 minutes early and say they are there when they are just leaving home. I guess one could try that approach too. Oh and check your order. About 4 times out of 10, they've forgotten something or completely messed something up. *sigh*",92618

We started off with the lobster avocado roll. It was really fishy tasting and the lobster was stringy. It did not taste fresh and I'm questioning if it was real lobster. Next, we ordered the black pepper chicken and honey chicken and they were just ok. We did like the honey chicken more.I ordered a second drink (Coors Light) and was brought out a Bud Light. Told the girl (who was not our server) that it was the wrong beer and she said ""Oh"" and walked away. A few minutes later our server arrives and says they are out of Coors Light. This was before 7:00 pm! I guess their supplier was a no-show today??Check your bill, because ours had 2 drinks charged on it that we didn't order. It was quickly resolved though.

Everyone had a problem with the drinks. So we all ordered new drinks, the same thing happened so at that point we just gave up and all drank water. It was too bad because the check would have been much better for the server if the drinks were correct. The food wasn't bad, it was the drinks and service that was horrible.

The idea is if the bathroom is dirty, it is authentic, because the staff is spending more time on the food. Also, if you see forks on the table run! Chinese food restaurant should only have chopsticks and maybe a spoon. You should have to ask for a fork and have trouble getting it because the servers speak.. GUESS WHAT?! Chinese!

I felt like I walked in to a French or gourmet American restaurant decorated with Chinese gift shop items that servers Chinese food. I dare you to blind fold a friend and take them there. Then after removing the blind fold ask them what kind restaurant is this.. not Chinese.",92618

We were surprised that they had not cleaned up the considerable amount of bird droppings on the furniture on the covered patio and that they offered us a table with seats with lots of bird droppings on them.  In fact, the staff seemed resigned to them and to believe that nothing could be done.  We moved to an inside table.  This is poor management.

The ONLY reason this review gets two stars is because our server was good. Other than that, the food was a joke. My salad - it was literally just lettuce.....and nothing else. I asked the server if my lettuce came with anything else. He said: that's the salad, the 'higher up' salad comes with more stuff. Are you guys fn kidding me?Main dish - the rice was hard, and undercooked. The chicken was 'ok', nothing short of spectacular.Service - our main server was awesome. She is the only reason why this review is getting a two. She was attentive and made the lunch experience fun. The other person helping her (dude who said 'higher up salad') was a waste. I would not recommend this place to anyone. In fact, all of my coworker (about 12) said that the food was so so. Definitely not returning.",92618

I only came to entertain my foreign roommate who was really interested in trying this place after it was mentioned on shows such as Southpark & The Big Bang Theory. They were comedy's Jo! They were making fun of the place, not promoting it!! Not only is this place pricey, but the food is not very good. There was nothing authentic about the food, but I tried my hardest to keep an open mind. If they were going for fusion, fine. But they were going for, ""Let's just put soy sauce in everything, serve with chopsticks, and call it Chinese food."" Here's what we ordered:- Hot & Sour Soup - salty, way too much soy sauce. The soup was literally black.- Chicken Lettuce Wraps - Decent. Crispy noodles, refreshing lettuce. - Sichuan Chicken Flatbread, or in PF Chang's case, Chicken Quesadilla.- Mongolian Beef - greasy, too much green onion & soy sauce- Crispy Honey Shrimp - loaded with batter and sugarly sauce, somewhat decent if you like candy- Moo Goo Gai Pan - A bit bland, but tender chicken- Strawberry Cheese Cake - Eh, tastes like they made it a couple days ago, so it was dry.- Tiramisu - same as the strawberry cheese cakeIf it wasn't for the service, decor, & cleanliness, I would have given this place a 3. But because they make the ""special PF Chang sauce"", I can't help but cringe and drop this place down to 2 star. Please Paul Fleming and Philip Chiang, stop opening these restaurants!!A little about my credentials:I first got into cooking & food when I was in college. After being rejected by numerous girls and getting zero action, I decided it was time for a change. I needed a new makeover to boost my geeky, engineering image. I applied for a cooking position at a Mediterranean-Italian  Restaurant near my home and learned to cook all sorts of pastas and dishes. I never became a professional chef, but I continue to enjoy & love food. 8 years later and 55 lbs heavier, I am now an engineer that travels all over the world trying new foods and learning about different cultures.",92618

I came here the other day with my boyfriend while we were running a few errands; we thought it'd be fun to stop in for a few drinks and apps and were pleasantly surprised with their killer house Bloody Mary.  I tried the dumplings, won ton and hot and sour soup as my appetizers and the flavor was simply lacking.  It tasted watered down and Americanized and lets' face it, the whole chain sort of embodies that essence.  The meal ended up incredibly filling, but I doubt we'll be coming back at their prices.  I will, however, stop by for one Bloody Mary every now and again - believe you me.",92618

Meaning that we were the last table which I am sure he didn't want, as he probably wanted to go home. Drinks were forever to get, and never refilled. It took over 40 minutes to order, and then almost an hour to get the food, which was served cold. I tend to believe the waiter was not there, maybe he was at the arcade or sports bar.After complaining the meals were comp'd considering the food was virtually inedible.

One tip for the restaurant....instead of the weird tasting sour red chili paste you put out on the table, try some Sriracha!

Changs restaurant, with lots of natural lighting and a great covered patio.  I like the open floorplan.I wish I could rate this restaurant better; however, the service was so poor that I simply cannot.  We ordered a ""Chang's for Two,"" which comes with soup, lettuce wraps, two entrees and dessert.  We also ordered some cocktails.From the start, they were out of ingredients for the first cocktail we ordered. Then we waited about 15 minutes for our substitute cocktail to arrive.  Once we placed our food order, it took 30 MINUTES for our SOUP to arrive. The overall meal took us about 2 hours, and that's not because we were eating slowly, it was because the food took soooo loonnnnggg to come out. Our entire section cleared out before we were served!At the end of the meal, they took ages to process our check, and I do think we should have been offered something for their ridiculously poor and slow service, but we were not. The decor of the restaurant is nice and the food is about as good as any other of the other restaurants in the chain. This location just needs to step up their service. If the fact that there were two incidents where servers dropped trays of plates is any indication of the service, then that should give you an idea.",92618

She has been bugging me to try this place for so long and i finally caved. BOY! I AM GLAD I DID!!! The service and the food was so amazing! Our server was so nice and made our experience even better! His name is Chris Gonzales (my wife asked for his last name) he was such wonderful young man and his customer service was on point! He made sure our drinks were constantly filled and came and checked on us to make sure the food was to our satisfaction. I would come back to this restaurant just from the service my wife and I received.This place should be grateful for having employees that bring customers back due to their services. I highly recommend CHRIS GONZALES to be moved to be a manager of some type because we will be back in the future.Thanks for the great service Chris!,92618

The only reason I'm even giving 1 star is  because at the very least the service was good. My bf and I ordered the chang special for two for $39.99.First, Underneath our table was a handful of used eating utensils just hanging around (spoons, knives, etc.).Secondl, we ordered the hot and sour soup and the soup was quite opposite. It was cold and DISGUSTING I had to make it sour by adding vinegar and pepper for some spice. Then, was it edible.Third, the entrees that we ordered were lo mein with beef and spicy chicken. The noodles were dry and stuck together like from a frozen pack and the chicken wasn't spicy it was sweet and sour.Our first and last time at this restaurant.  If you want good chinese food in Irvine spectrum go to the capital seafood near the ferris wheel.

Then our entrees came.  The singapore street noodles were disappointing and the Mo Po Tofu just tasted wrong.  The  broccoli that came with it was cooked well.  Maybe it was the dishes we ordered.  Maybe it's just this location.  But I was not impressed (except for the chicken lettuce wrap).  Good thing my sister paid. :) I didn't even want the leftovers.  Enough said.",92618

This is the second time we had issues with this place. I went in to put my name in the list. The girl at the front said it will take 45min. So for a Saturday night it sounded ok. We were walking around and went back almost an hour later. Still she said it's going to be another 30min!!??? ARE YOU KIDDING ME... Even though they had many tables empty but no one to clean them up???? Finally we were given a table and ordered. The order took for ever to come and the food quality was horrible.

I would have never come back to this particular restaurant if t wasn't for our server Roger.  Although the order was incorrect and the amount of time it took to come was ridiculous, Roger made sure to make me feel accommodated for and actually comped the food and a round of drinks. I understand that it was a busy Saturday night and though the kitchen may have been backed up I was still frustrated how long it was taking, especially when I was expecting a super quick meal before going out for the night.

723,"514 Spectrum Center Dr Irvine, CA 92618",Jean S.,"Irvine, CA",12/25/2014,2,"Don't expect authentic Chinese food, and you'll have an OK time. Other Yelpers hit the nail on the head when they described it as a marked up Panda Express. The only reason I was compelled to come here for the first time (despite the poor reviews) was because I had a gift card. The Honey Chicken was pretty good, but it came with no vegetables, so I had to order the Buddha's Feast (a stir-fried vegetable & tofu medley). I also got the Strawberry Cucumber Limeade, and THIS was very delicious (but so dinky). The Kung Pao Chicken should just be called Chicken because there was no Kung Pao to it at all (no spice or that signature Kung Pao flavor). Management was...horrendous. We waited 30 minutes to be seated, and when our party was called, the hostess awkwardly and aimlessly walked us around the restaurant unable to find us a table. She ended up seating us at a randomly selected spot that hadn't been cleared yet (check, tip and everything else still sitting there). Not what you'd expect after waiting for half an hour. As soon as we sat down, a random server started to set-up a pot of soup in front of us without a word (confusion ensued). When he made eye contact with our waiter, he quickly realized he had the wrong table and hastily packed everything up and hustled off without saying anything else. Talk about disorganization, and a poor first impression.It was clear our waiter was trying to learn the ropes, and later we found out he had just been promoted to waiter after a year of being a bus boy. He was earnest, genuinely sweet and attentive. If not for him, this would have been a one-star review. I wish him the best. Judging form my overall first experience, I probably will not be coming here again.",92618

Chang's was last night (Tuesday) at 5 p.m. We came here because we'd received a gift card.  Let me tell you, we won't be coming back again unless it's to use another gift card.  This was horrible.The restaurant wasn't busy even though it's in the Irvine Spectrum, but the service was pretty average (if not below).  We asked to sit inside because it was warmer and the guy sat us at the draftiest possible table - right in front of the door to the patio.   We waited 5-10 minutes  for our server to arrive just to ask to be moved to a different table.  Server #1 didn't end up serving us that night - thank goodness!  She did not look like she was in a good mood and she acted like we'd inconvenienced her just by being sat in her section.Server #2 did a much better job.  Although she wasn't overly friendly or helpful (what are these sauces and why are you mixing them together?), she did manage to get our food order quickly and accurately.  However, it took a long time to actually get our food and when it came the noodles we so burnt they were sticking together and we couldn't get them on to our plates without taking the whole dish.  The server didn't come back until 10 minutes after we gotten our meal, and by then we'd navigated away from the most burnt section and eaten what we could.  She wasn't even apologetic when we explained about the burnt noodles, but she did offer to make us a new dish.  That's nice, but since we'd already salvaged and eaten some of the dish since she didn't come by, it was sort of pointless.  In all fairness, the Mongolian Beef was very good - but it was the only good thing.  We will avoid this place in the future.  If I want overpriced Asian fusion food, I will go to Pick Up Stix or Pei Wei.  There is nothing authentic at P.F. Chang's and the service was pretty dismal. It should have been a hint about the food that there was not one Asian person in the restaurant besides myself  - given the demographics of this area, that says a lot.",92618

I barely eat any Chinese food, because its too oily and salty for me. their food is not oily, but its super salty. I think they have a few dishes among the saltiest food list of all restaurants. Good thing about this place is the decor, very trendy, service is very good, they have full bar. food menu is big,  good wine, sake and cocktail menu, so many to choose from, they have everything. its reasonable priced for the service, decor and portion. This place is actually good for a nice dinner date, for the decor and service,  but the food is too salty for my taste, I 'v been to a few locations of this restaurant, most of the times was because I needed salty hangover cure food. only one dinner date here, bad choice, the salt gave me puffy eyes the next day.

This place was definitely one of those overpriced places you only go for when the company is picking up the tab. The food is super Americanized wannabe fusion food that you get what they want to make look appetizing but lack in execution. First of all our waiter was either having a bad day, just really hated life, or really hated his job or maybe all of the above? He was literally giving us some sarcastic comments everytime he came to the table and not to mention he kept slamming all the plates on the table. I mean cmon he almost knocked over a bowl of rice when he set the glass of water down. It's like take a chill pill dude! The ambiance of the place felt like any other chain restaurant similar to cheesecake with all the modern trendy decorations and furniture. Square tables and round tables were scattered all around the perimeter with booths situated on the edges and middle. Since we had a rather large party we decided to do an asian style and share all of our orders. We ordered almost everything off the lunch bowl menu. My favorite definitely was the crispy honey chicken. It was a light chicken breast fried in super light yet crispy battery stir fried in a sweet tangy sweet n sour sauce. The egg drop soap served with each dish was abit bland however. Unlike the traditional yellow egg drop soaps this actually looked like the hot and sour soup color. It was just super sweet and salty with a hint of sourness. Overall all of the dishes were quite greasy and super salty. So overall i would give the food a 3/5 and overall value of 2/5.",92618

Spicy? It's nowhere found on this dish but other than the lack of heat, it's decent.The Fried Rice Combo:  It's good enough.  Not too greasy.On a positive note: they offer both white and brown rice without extra charge.Overall: Ehh...I would probably only here for the bar since it looked like that's where the party was.",92618

731,"514 Spectrum Center Dr Irvine, CA 92618",Stephanie J.,"Irvine, CA",4/23/2015,3,The prices for the quality and taste of food is just ridiculous. This place is successful because it is so Americanized and frankly most people that are not Asian don't mind paying the prices for it. If you go to a traditional Chinese restaurant you could easily get a whole plate of food to feed your entire family for $7 or less during lunch. It's pretty incredible. That is how I grew up and what I am accustomed to. My mother would tell me I am stupid and unreasonable for eating at a place that will charge $15-20 for a plate of decent food.,92618

The water was quick but the beer was slow and warm. We ordered our food starting with the home made egg rolls which came just warm and dripping in frying oil. We asked for paper napkins so we could soak out some of the oil. During all this time approx 45 minutes later the food never showed. The manager now gets involved and is also very polite. Everyone is polite but All I want is my dinner. I didn't go there to buy polite. The manager bought our oily egg bombs and the warm beer. Thanking us as we left in utter disappointment. The most upsetting part of the ordeal was that no one communicated anything to us.

I've worked as a waitress before and you're supposed to greet your table within 5 minutes of them sitting down.

Um did you not realize someone already took our order while you were busy doing whatever..? After that the waitress didn't bring our drinks to us for almost 15 minutes... by this time we were there for 45 minutes without even having drinks...WTF... The waitress came back and i asked her if she could send the manager over. She was obviously pissed that we asked to talk to the manager because she knew we were not happy about her service. But then guess what, THE MANAGER NEVER CAME. We sat there for 25 minutes waiting for the manager.

Chang's is not real Chinese food.  I'm still a fan of this location and their food.  I've never been disappointed. I declared Sunday to be Chinese Sunday so we were in the area and the BF and I headed here.  It was fairly quiet for a Sunday lunch and we got seated in the back despite passing a lot of empty tables near the front.  Ok, whatever.The waitress was prompt to take drink orders - two Pibb Xtra's. And was consistent and attentive during the entire meal.  Never missed a beat.  Gotta love that!  We settled for some spicy entrees and then my beau turned the menu around and found a price fix menu that had everything we wanted at a $30 price for 2 people.  Can't beat that!We started things off with egg drop soup and veggie lettuce wraps.  The egg drop soup wasn't anything special.  I preferred the lettuce wraps that arrived later.  The waitress was kind enough to make a spicy sauce to go along with our veggie wraps. We wanted spicy entrees so we chose the Chang's Spicy Chicken and the Dali Chicken. For being compared to General Tso's chicken, the Chang's Spicy Chicken wasn't all that spicy and resembled more of an orange chicken dish than anything else but it was still good.  We both preferred the Dali Chicken that came with leeks and sliced potatoes.  It had a nice balance of flavors and we polished off the dish and couldn't wait for dessert.Dessert here is served in miniature square shot glasses. It's just the right size after a meal.  The BF got the great wall of chocolate and I got the strawberry cheesecake.  Both were delicious!  Our fortunes cookies left us much to think about.  Mine read that a new pair of shoes would do me a world of good.  Do I need to go shopping soon?My BF got two fortunes in his: A long lost relative will soon come along to your benefit and your blessings will multiply this coming month.  Good luck!Hmm?",92618

We didn't complain because we weren't in a rush and everyone was being so nice. They ended up taking off one of our entrees from the bill which was more than expected and a very happy suprise!

I've been avoiding it for as long as I could, but my friend wanted to try it, seeing how there's always a lot of people seated inside, so we decided to give it a shot.The quality of food is bad. Just bad.The service is awful, first they wanted to seat us in a hidden room (I'm willing to bet anything that they would just leave us there and forget about us). I asked to be seated at a booth, because there was one open and we were standing right next to it, but we were told that we have to wait, I asked if it was reserved... The answer was no. But we couldn't sit there. Ok... Then when we finally got seated, the waiter forgot about us, then I tried getting his attention for 10 minutes, unsuccessfully, when he finally decided to show , he managed to mess up the order and disappear once again.

Me and my two friends decided to sit on the patio, only to be sat at a table under a broken heater. Not necessarily something that would ruin my experience, but with everything that happened it certainly didn't help. We ordered chicken lettuce wraps to start (which were delicious as always), but then sat around for awhile after finishing them before the waiter even came to take our order for the entree. After finally placing our orders for the main course, we proceeded to wait over FORTY-FIVE MINUTES to get our three food items: a sushi roll, honey chicken, and pad Thai--items that do not warrant that long of a wait time during a rush, let alone when the restraint is dead like when we went at 7. A runner comes out to inform us that someone ""dropped the pad thai"" (we have our suspicions that they just forgot to put our order in since the table that ordered after us got their pad thai before us...) and offers us more lettuce wraps, which kind you we had already eaten 20 minutes before. After asking twice to turn the heater on, the waiter finally tells us it's broken and moves us to a different table, which is totally fine!! But then he didn't bring us any plates or silverware after telling us he would, we grabbed it ourselves off our old table after awhile. The food comes and it was totally average tasting. In fact, the pad Thai was absolutely disgusting and watery and the ahi on the sushi roll was way softer than it should be. After getting the $50 bill, everything was still on it, we weren't compensated for anything until we asked the manager to take off the lettuce wraps since they offered them to us for free before--we still paid $40 for the worst dining experience I've had in a long time. I work in the food industry so I understand mistakes happen, but this was not handled properly at all. Overall I am super disappointed in the quality of service and the quality of food....Do better, PF Chang's. This is unacceptable.",92618

750,"514 Spectrum Center Dr Irvine, CA 92618",Dan K.,"Buckeye, AZ",12/28/2012,2,"I have to state that this review is for the Chang's in Irvine, at the Specrum. If you're considering a different Chang's, this review wouldn't be fair in judging any others.Before our table was ready, our group of four had ordered drinks in the bar area. You have to understand that this restaurant is open to the elements. For that reason, they have in the bar area an effective series of those radiant, gas space heaters. Even though this is Southern California, it's been pretty cold by our wuss standards. When we were seated, we took our drinks into the dining area with us. There are no heaters there, and the outdoor exposure kept it pretty cold; they need heaters there too. I noticed that many had put their jackets on, as did I.But here are the most outrageous things, and the reason for the 2-star rating. The four of us were seated at a table for four. Chang's should have been happy with the fact that we'd ordered a lot of food plus appetizers. It turned out there was such little table space, there wasn't room for it. It was so crowded, we moved plates ourselves to a ledge that was behind us. We even ended up having some of our entrees boxed up for taking them home, which we stacked. We had the waitress re-dish several items into bowls, to make for a smaller footprint, which helped a little. Can you imagine? The food congestion made for an entirely unpleasant experience.I know you're thinking, ""Why didn't they just ask for a bigger table?"" As another reviewer wrote, they wouldn't do it because they said empty tables were all already reserved. Which I'm sure is true.We'll never go back there, even though the food was wonderful and the serivce was very good. Waitresses were apologetic, but really couldn't do much. It also begs the question as to why the tables are so small, but obviously it's designed that way to serve more customers.Dan Kap,Whittier, CADanK5@hotmail.com",92618

Not my job. When she caught on that something was missing from our order she says ""if you have a problem, tell your server."" Why the hell do I need to wait for my server when you're standing right here?

Ginger chicken with broccoli...Chicken fried rice with no egg...the gluten-free chocolate dome. Yum!So why does this location rank only 3 stars, you ask?Because each time I order takeout - which, I admit, is frequently because I work fairly close by - no matter if I show up on time or 5 minutes late or 10 minutes late or even 15 minutes late to pick it up, you inevitably leave me sitting in my car waiting...and waiting...and waiting... This happens at least 80% of the time I order. And it doesn't matter if I am picking up at the height of the lunch hour or at 2 in the afternoon on a Wednesday. Clean up your carside service, add more kitchen staff to your lunch hours during the week, and I'll reassess your rating. Until then, placing an order online and having to wait 40-50 minutes before it's ready, then sitting in my car waiting for another 10 minutes AFTER the assigned pickup time, is pretty bad service.

Out of everything the California roll was the best tasting and how can they mess that up? Our son's honey chicken was 6 small pieces that rolled around on the huge plate. Our daughter's lomein portion was so small, maybe half a cup or less? Now for our food. From what I remember shrimp with lobster sauce was suppose to be white and creamy. This was dark gray with fried pieces of black bean stuck on the small shrimps. The orange chicken looked like it came straight from a cheap buffet. The rice was so hard it kept crumbling out of the bowl. We were just so disappointed today and spending 57 bucks plus we had to add tip- totally not worth it. What a bummer.",92618

Because of that, you do get to see few unique different things on the menu unlike other PF Changs. also, they may just have one of the really cool open bar ( greedy effers dont rush.. its very open and outdoorsy is all i meant!). Their bartenders do make some serious drinks for a every day low price of $10 a pop, which reduces to $6 during their happy hour which is weekly 3 to 6.(boo!). From their lunch menu I like the lamb dish, and eggplant. Both of them are about 10$s and delicious. You can ask for brown rice!  I am not too crazy about their main entrees.

Almost everything on their menu is part of this deal so you have a lot of choices.  For appetizer, I like to get the calamari; thinly sliced and lightly fried and has a nice saltiness to it.  For soup, you can pick other hot and sour or egg drop only. I prefer the hot and sour.  For entrees, I love their kung pao scallops.  The Mongolian beef was ok, a little too salty.  I did not like the walnut shrimp at all.  It had way too much mayo and it was served w/ melon balls.  Very weird.  I liked their string beans.  Nice crunch and flavor.  They have a really great lunch special menu too.  Most of their menu is on the lunch special for about $10.  Plus, you get rice and a soup/salad too.  Now I can eat lunch here as well!I've had their asian pear mojito.  The asian pear flavor was a little lacking, and not strong enough.  The service was great: servers were attentive and accommodating.",92618

The service was AMAZING - both times (and one time was on mother's day so we were extra surprised at how attentive everyone was.)On the second visit, my husband and I were each going to order a cup of the egg flower drop soup and the waitress recommended we share a bowl. HOLY HECK the bowl is HUGE! We each had about 4 cups out of it - it is a tureen. And the soup was the best I've ever had.The restaurant is clean, service is impeccable and the food is amazing.

This place is nothing but a fat rip off, about $13+ for ONE entree that you eat with rice. It's just rice! The food here you can find at a seafood capital for about $8. It's nothing fancy, pretty basic food. This aint no lobster. Save your money, take it somewhere else. My buddy ordered some sort of noodle, it was a bowl of heart attack.

801,"514 Spectrum Center Dr Irvine, CA 92618",Dave L.,"Irvine, CA",12/21/2011,3,"In the life of most restaurants, the first few years are usually the best and brightest, full of enthusiasm, energy, and vitality. And as the years go by, the quality and enthusiasm goes downhill. However, there are a few exceptions to this rule and PF Chang's at the Spectrum is one of those rare exceptions because it just got a lot better!Entering the NEWLY remodeled dining area is like entering a million dollar yacht, with an all-teak interior, fully opened up bar area, and an expansive indoor/outdoor seating  under a canopy. Gently breezes, sunshine, and sweet aromas engulfed me as I walked in. Once my number was called, I asked to set in an angular table with soft bench seating facing the outdoors. Glancing at the one page menu--always nice to see--I ordered the lettuce wraps as a Starters, a freshly brewed tropical ice tea, and SICHUAN SHRIMP OR SCALLOPS with brown rice for my main Lunch Entree.  Our waitress Maggie was bubbly, eager to please, and extremely helpful and fun. She kept us completely satisfied and made us feel recognized and important. Everything on the menu is reasonably priced, especially for lunch. The Starter arrived in about ten to fifteen minutes and our food some time later. Luckily the atmosphere and waitress were so pleasant that we didn't notice how long it took for the food to come. Everything tasted fresh, tangy, a bit on the spicy side, and delicious.  I absolutely loved the fresh vegetables with pickled cucumbers on the side with my shrimp, a fantastic flavor combination.Our bill for three people was very reasonable for the food experience, but PF Chang is a chain restaurant you are thinking? Yes, but when those who run a restaurant chain like PF Chang get together and ""Continually Improve"" on a good thing already, they reach a level of quality many others can learn from. They have given Irvine their finest restaurant and dining experience at reasonable prices.  Yes, I'm now a huge fan of PF Chang's at the Spectrum.",92618

Crappy part is how horrible the management is. Servers and hosts do just fine, but when you come to get dinner on a Wednesday night and the wait is over an hour....but it gets better. Half of the restaurant seating was empty. Management just doesn't know how to schedule to save their life. Sad but true. Will try coming back again soon, food is just to good. But the management, totally different story. Someone else needs to take over and learn how to schedule and hire accordingly.

Chang's. The wait is endless and I don't mind waiting if the food is good but ugh the food here really isn't that great. On top of that, it is expensive. Over the years I've tried parts of dishes here and there and the only redeeming factor is their Honey Walnut Shrimp and even this dish I find a bit sweet. So its the best out of everything bad. Not good. Everything else seems to be either drenched in sauce and super greasy. A note, everything served here is Westernized Chinese food so if you are looking for authentic Chinese food, this is definitely not the place to go to.

I don't remember what dish i had, but, I never came back. I thought it was boring and flavorless. until tonite. i owed my friends a dinner and they love this restaurant. okay fine. i arrived early. service is great. everyone smiles. I had a coconut lemon drop. I normally don't like coconut but I like a lemon drop. this drink was so good. it was like a limoncello or a creamy spiked lemonade. we ordered crispy green beans and flaming wontons. the green beans were great. esp with the fiery sauce it comes with. the batter is very light (similar to a tempura batter). the wontons had great flavor. the texture was not my favorite because they were steamed = slightly mushy wonton skins. we ate family style: combo fried rice, honey crispy shrimp, mongolian beef, and lemon chicken. every dish was excellent. the fried rice was nice and subtle. not burned. not lumpy. i wish the honey shrimp had some candied walnuts but it was great sans nuts. the beef was crispy on the edges. the bigger pieces were pink in the center just how i likey. the lemon chicken was everyone's favorite. my pf chang boycott has ended. muah.",92618

Chang's after the recent remodel and revamping of the menu.  Some things have changed and others have stayed the same.The drink menu has expanded to include these drinks for 2 that they can't serve to one person.  It contains 2 1/2 times the alcohol of a normal drink, disguised under some fruit flavorings.The small plates (appetizers) still include the Chicken Lettuce Wraps, Crispy Green Beans, Egg Rolls and Spring Rolls.  They have added Kashmir Wok-Seared Lamb (spicy and delicious), Sizzling Black Iron Mussels and Bang Bang Chicken Flatbread to name a few.  The soups are the same, you have Egg Drop, Hot and Sour and Wonton.The entree are combination of classic and some new dishes.  We ordered the Pepper Steak and Sweet and Sour Chicken from the P. F. Chang's for Two (2 soup, 1 Small Plate, 2 Entrees and 1 Dessert for $19.95 per person) menu.  Everything is just as I had remembered it.  The dessert selections for the deal were limited to a custard, pudding and ice cream.  We ended up trying the Chocolate, Cinnamon Pudding and it was delicious.Now to what they have changed ... the staff has been completely turned over.  Fortunately, service has not suffered.  Our server was extremely knowledgeable, friendly and efficient.  He forgot nothing and made sure we never needed to ask for everything.The decor has been completely changed for the better and the bar is indoor and outdoor with glass panels they can raise and lower.  The new outdoor area is very warm and inviting (I think this has caused Javier's to do an add-on to their outside area and the concept is very similar), the inside is elegant.  The only knock I give the new outside area is the chairs and booths are lower and those of us above 6' tall feel uncomfortable sitting in them.  With the world getting taller, why in the world would you make your chairs shorter?The place is busy all the time, so make a reservation or be prepared to wait for over an hour (closer to 2 hours on the weekends).",92618

I had never been here before, but I definitely had a great time. We had the outside table for 20 people. My parents ordered the food ahead of time, so all we had to do was order our drinks and wait for our food. Our waitress was super nice! I actually had a conversation with her about graduation and plans for the future because she just graduated the year before. I'm a sucker for good customer service, so I always love it when the servers are nice and personable.The food was pretty darn good! I feel like my parents ordered almost everything off the menu because they just kept bringing the plates out. Food on food on food! My only complain would be that one of the dishes was just a little too salty. It was one of the chicken dishes.. I have no idea which one though. That feast is pretty much all a blur. I just remember feeling full and completely happy after the meal.As for the price, I have no idea how the pricing was..

She asked how my daughters name is spelled and came back with a huge slice of cake with ""way to go Cailin"" on it with little red hearts around it.

They let us choose where we wanted to sit, so that was nice. They weren't too busy when we went so we got our food pretty quickly. I'd say lunch took less than an hour.

The three pieces of dumplings and California roll were just average, the crab wontons were nicely crispy with a tasteful sauce at the bottom, and the spare ribs were perfectly cooked with a coat of this Asian sauce.

The outside patio is gorgeous, even though I recommend sitting inside to get a look at the beautiful decor from floor up to the ceiling.The menu has changed slightly since the remodel, however it is amazingly delicious, as always. I was told by the waiter that this is the only test kitchen in the US for them, where new foods are put on the menu and tried out before it gets put on the menu at other locations. BONUS!The drinks are always yummy and the bartenders can have a heavy hand, which is another bonus. Yes the prices can be a bit expensive, however when you go with people share a couple dishes. It reduces the cost and is totally worth being able to have a couple menu items. I will forever go here and recommend you try it out as well.",92618

The food came out quick, we had the garlic shrimp something rather, kung pao shrimp and lo mein - oh and shrimp dumplings. The food was overall good. I could taste that it was quite salty but nothing out of the ordinary that you wouldn't expect of any restaurant food. Let's face it, all restaurant food is loaded with salt. The restaurant was rather dark and crowded but overall it had a pleasant atmosphere.

The steamed shrimp dumplings were good, that's because there was not sauce and it wasn't fried. We ordered the tofu lettuce wraps and told them to redo it. It had way too much sodium. I think there is a very good reason this restaurant is in the Not This, Eat This category. If I go back here again, I will tell them to hold the sauce on everything.

Bought our tickets and noticed we still had some time to kill. Walked towards P.F. Chang's and decided to get a drink while we were waiting.We sat at the bar, I started with a water and my sister went straight for a beer. Prankster, I believe it was. I was reading over they're cocktails and a couple stuck out to me, but I remember my sister telling me there was this one cocktail they used to have on their menu that I had to try. She assured me that if it used to be on the menu, that they would still be able to make it. I forget what it's was called.The bartender didn't have all the ingredients to make it, but she tried her best to get it as close as its supposed to be. Despite that it wasn't exactly what I ordered, it was yummy. Tasted like lychee. My sister said that it's not the same color and didn't taste the same, but said it at least tasted good.",92618

When we got there, we were told that the wait was 45 minutes long. So we bought our tickets for the theater and waited. When 45 minutes have gone by, he asked if a table was ready. It wasn't.  They said another 15 minutes. Meanwhile about 6 girls who work there were all congregating at the hostess stand, chatting, laughing, and having social hour.  That already looks really unprofessional when you have so many customers waiting for a table.  Another 15 minutes went by, and the giggling hostess told us that the table is still not ready. When I told her the original estimate was 45 minutes and we had been waiting for over an hour, she lied to our face and said that she never told us 45 minutes even though we both heard her. Meanwhile looking at the restaurant, there were several empty tables so instead of socializing these girls could have been setting these tables up. Finally, after another 5 or 10 minutes, we got  a table and they put us in the crappiest table in the whole restaurant right by the kitchen where the door swings every two seconds with waiters going in and out. Completely ruined the romantic mood and we kept moving from one side of the table to the other to see if it would make it better (It didn't). They REALLY need a basic screen to separate the table from the kitchen so customers don't have to watch the swinging door right in their face the entire time they are trying to enjoy their dinner. Last time we were there, we also waited for a long time only to be given a table outside where we had to keep our jackets and everything on or get cold (it was winter and the heater was broken). The food is more or less the same as other PF Chang's and for the most part, the waiters are good as well. However, the restaurant is poorly managed and can't handle table turn over effectively on a busy night. I don't think we'll ever try it again without a reservation and specifying that we don't want to deal with swinging doors or being cold outside without a heater.P.S. We did speak to the manager, and he offered to take care of our appetizers, so that's good at least.",92618

It was definitely crispy but tasted greasy and lacked the flavor of what glazed duck should taste like, there wasn't even any glaze on it the second time around :(When we finally got to tell our server (who by now was avoiding our table) he apologized and asked if he could bring something else.  We ordered lettuce wraps since we were still hungry.  When we got our bill we were charged for all items including the duck we never ate.  We tried calling the server over since he was avoiding our gaze to ask about the bill, but he told us to hang on.  (wow!) When he came over we asked about being charged, he said we already at too much of the duck!  We explained that my husband and I each tried a bite when it first came out (since we were sharing both entrees and appetizer) and then we each tried another bite when the dish came out again.  He reluctantly asked the manager to take it off but told us it was doubtful the manager would do it.We felt so bad about the experience that on our way out we went to speak to the manager.  She said he was one of their best servers and apologized for the experience.On a positive note, the appetizer with the orange sesame salad dressing was amazing, lettuce wraps delicious as always, and mango chicken with thail basil ahhhmazing (except it didn't have basil in it I'm sure of, I love thai basil) but it was still good!",92618

For a party of 2, our bill was 84.00. We asked that kevin, the waiter,split it evenly 2 ways and gave 2 credit cards. We get the receipts and he charged the full amount of the bill on my card....& he also charged half of the amount of the bill on the same card... So 150% of the bill was charged on my card and none on the other card. I told him of the mistake and he said he would fix it.... ""Fixing it"" would have been refunding the $84 on my card and charging my friend the $42. He refunded the $42 on my card....& charged my friend $42.... But he didn't refund the $84. He then gave me a receipt for the voided $42. I told him I'm supposed to pay the $42, not the $84 considering out entire bill was $84. So then he said he couldn't give me a receipt showing that he voided the $84.... Even though he showed me a receipt showing he voided the $42... How does that make sense? Yeah it doesn't.

I even called the manager today to let him know how unhappy we were. After talking to him fora few minutes I realized were the real problem is.

Soon, we chatted with the outside waitress and she told me that you can sit at one of the tables on their patio because it is considered bar service. Although the place was jam packed, with a line well out the door, a few tables on the patio were available but the hostesses does not tell anyone they can sit outside.

We tried each others dishes, and they were both REALLY DELICIOUS! I found the steak tender and a perfect medium and my duck breast was the best thing I have eaten out in Irvine in a while.The 5 spice leg of duck was good and gave it to my husband because it was just too much meat on a plate (for me- as I am not big on meat) I actually loved each component of my plate.--Side Dish*lemon scented brussel sprouts were one thing i wanted to try. First i smelled them. They did not have any lemon scent but I was excited to try them anyway. They tasted bad. they come charred and thankfully these came late to the table because they tasted like wok char and i disliked it immensely and it left me with a bitter palate and an unpleasant taste after one bite. I sent them back to the kitchen because the waiter told me that they shouldn't be charred (but they are). so they took it off the bill which is nice because i was really disappointed.

We went to dinner on an admittedly busy evening between Christmas and New Years, but much was lacking about our experience.

Our table was missing placesettings until we asked for them (after our appetizer had arrived). My drink refills were slow to arrive, and while service improved somewhat as the evening went on, things seemed slow all night. More generally, this location's ""new"" menu (the restaurant was recently renovated and now serves as a ""test location"", from what I've read) has drastically marginalized the vegetarian selections - there used to be icons denoting dishes, now there's only 4 items, at the bottom of the menu. Not only that, the noodle and rice dishes, even without meat in them, still aren't vegetarian, a change, and something not mentioned on the menu.

My husbad and I went and our food came out at different times. Not a big deal since I had a salad. I did order a side of another dressing because I wasn't sure which one I was going to like more and was charged $3 for the tiny cup of it. At the same point I ordered the dressing I ordered a sangria and didnt get it until I was done with my salad. The server blamed it on the bar but I sat and watched the bartender make several other drinks for servers and people sitting at the bar. This upset me extremely. I understand if you forgot but lying to the customer pissed me off. I will never eat at any P.F. Changs again, especially this one.",92618

You can also get the full menu in the bar area, so you don't have to wait for a table if you don't want to.",92618

885,"514 Spectrum Center Dr Irvine, CA 92618",jill j.,"Irvine, CA",9/5/2008,4,"Listen up, people! If you want authentic chinese food, i strongly suggest to go to SGV or Rowland Heights. The chances of having a chinese cook/chef making your meal at PF Changs are nil. This is Americanized chinese food aka, ""oriental"" food catered to the white palate. capish?!I find there is almost always a wait during dinner time. I suggest coming for lunch or an early dinner/ happy hour time instead. Plus, there's always the bar if you really have to wait, and I mean to eat aside from getting a drink. They serve lunch bowls too, obviously for the lunch hour, and they are huge, enough for two people. Their pepper steak is really good but what's even more delicious is the oolong marinated sea bass. If you haven't tried it, you must. Their brown rice isn't bad either (and supposedly on the healthy side). Top off your meal with their shot glass desserts. I suggest the tiramisu - really good.. just enough sweetness and not too much coffee aftertaste. And then of course, there's the service. Once when we sat at the bar to eat, the bartender took our orders right away and even served our shared entree in two plates. He made sure he'd check on us from time to time. Same thing happened when we were seated at a table. Maybe it was just a lucky day, i dunno. They are really not that bad.",92618

There's a bar; an outdoor, heated patio with a fire pit in the middle; and a restaurant area. Still, I would only come here for the drinks.Pros:Drinks! Came here once for drinks with the girls. I had their house special -- a ginger lemonade, then asked if they could spike it. The bartender flashed a huge smile and high-fived me for loving alcohol so much. They put gin in it, at my request... amazing, delicious drink.Ambience. Very sexy decor... a beautiful, modern ""Chinese"" restaurant with trees in the middle, and many other Asian-inspired decorations. Cons:Food. If you want westernized Chinese food, then come here. I ordered a salad without the meat for dietary restrictions, which tasted like something that came out of the bag at Albertson's. My friend got a chicken dish, which was also so-so. See, I can't even remember what we ordered. It was basically mediocre. Any Questions? If you have questions about ingredients, your server will probably not know. Instead, mine just answered a hesitant ""yes!"" to all my questions. So if you're gluten-free; allergic to peanuts, etc... your best bet is not to come here, as I didn't want to bother him any more to return to the kitchen. Also, there are not many gluten-free options, as Chinese food is usually cooked in soy sauce. Waiting Area: I guess they want you to wait outside, because there are no seats to wait. I was ushered into the bar area, where my friends and I stood awkwardly (it's not really a mingling bar environment), as all the seats were taken.To sum it up, stop by for a drink, then head over to Cucina or Wood Ranch Grill for the food.

No one ever asked us if everything was OK, if we wanted anything else, etc.  I waved down a bartender 1/2 way through our meal to ask for an iced tea.  Was never offered a refill.  My husband told the bartender that took our food order that we weren't happy with the service when we left.

Starting now. With PF Chang's. As mentioned in my other reviews, on of my biggest beefs about Orange County is that PF Chang's is considered to be one of the better restaurants. Horrifying! I always want to hear about the special dim sum place or the perfect taqueria. But instead, all I hear is ""PF Chang's""!Is PF Chang's edible? Yes. Basically the lettuce wraps are nice, and the asparagus has it's moments. But is there anything special about this food? No. It is basically edible food from a large chain. And like food from any large chain, the production value of the food has to be called into question.A friend told me the story of a former employee who told him that the number one ingredient in PF Chang's food is sugar. Thinking back to the dishes I have tried there, I do have to wonder if there is some truth to this.  PF Chang's does specialize in sweet dishes, such as sweet and sour chicken, and many of the meats have a sweet glaze over them.",92618

The chicken tastes fresh and doesn't have the heavy skin or breaded crust found in many other Chinese restaurants. I also get the Kung Pao and Chicken Wraps often--both are great. The staff is generally helpful and happy. I have been there twice in the past month with clients or friends and the experience was good. I don't think there are any negatives about this place.

The service was good, nothing super fancy or fast.  However the guy was good about refilling our drinks and overall seemed comfortable with his job.  I was watching some of the other servers and they all seemed to be on their A game getting their tables turned and served.  Things seemed to be moving.We hit them up for a late lunch on a Thursday so I didn't experience what some of the other reviewers said about how busy it is.  But if you know the Spectrum at night, you might want to stay away from eating at this restaurant during those hours lol.  That or plan ahead and make reservations.",92618

It was a good thing I made reservations for myself and my companion. Upon checking in, the hostess had us wait for less than five minutes, then we were seated promptly.I have to say, the place looks very nice. The decor was beautiful, and I could see the fire pit outside that looked pleasant as well. I was definitely impressed with the look of the restaurant.My companion and I did the Chang's 2 for $19.99/person special: both my companion had I got the mussels (appetizer), mango chicken, fried glazed shrimp, hot and sour soup, egg drop soup, and coconut/vanilla ice cream. Rice came with the entree. We added on a crab fried rice to the special too.Well, the soup came out fast enough, and I was fine with it. It was spicy, but tasted good. Next were the mussels which came out a little bit while longer: I liked this because most of the mussels were pretty large, and some of them tasted good.  But the entrees ... man, we waited forever for our entrees. Our server was very nice though, and it was apparent that the kitchen just wasn't getting the food out fast enough for everyone.  All around me, it seemed like people were waiting for their entrees.When the entrees came out, I was very hungry. But the mango chicken seemed boring -- a hint of an orange flavor that wasn't that great at all. The shrimp though was okay, and I had no problem with it. As for the crab fried rice, it was bland. There's definitely crab meat in there, but the whole dish lacks flavor, and the rice didn't look too appetizing at all.Although the price wasn't too bad, the food was disappointing. The place is aesthetically nice, the service isn't bad, but the kitchen really takes too long, and the food that comes out of there is mediocre at best.

The dishes are meant to be enjoyed by the masses. My favorite is the Spicy Chicken and Eggplant. All of the soups are wonderful. Don't hesitate to customize your dishes with the white vinegar (combats spiciness), soy sauce or chili oil. Also, use the amazing knowledge if their service team to modify dishes to get what you want. They have had some amazing suggestions since I have a few things that I can't eat due to diet restrictions. It is filling and always hits the spot. The service has always been great and I am happy that my food will taste the same each time I go there. Yes, you will wait for a long time on Friday and Saturday night but that's because people like to eat there before or after the movies (which is right next door).I love trying hole in the wall places but I am very aware that PF Changs offers a consistent experience no matter where you go.",92618

936,"514 Spectrum Center Dr Irvine, CA 92618",David B.,"Whittier, CA",7/18/2013,1,"Bad service, bad food and a dirty restaurant lead to a miserable dining experience. We had house flies buzzing around our poorly placed table in between the outside bar and main restaurant. Our first disappointment was our long wait to give our server our order. I unwrapped my napkin roll to find both of my forks were dirty. They had dried up food: carrots and something unidentifiable on it.  I told the server we were in a hurry and to please have everything come at once. They are located right next to a movie theatre so I didn't think this would be an issue. We ordered two appetizers and three entrees. I feared given how long it took to take our order that if we didn't order the food to come together we were in for a long wait.The green beans and the lettuce wraps came first and we were finished with them before our entrees arrived. The entrees were not good.  The Buddha's feast came steamed even though we ordered stir fried and the Lo Mien had a piece of barely cooked chicken even though we ordered pork. The fried noodles under the honey shrimp were stale. If you are going to offer so few shrimp the fried noodles should be worth eating. My family and I felt we were left unattended most of our visit. I don't remember being asked how our food was and I know we were not greeted by a supervisor/manager. Our drinks were re-filled once. We were there for an hour even though we had told our server we were in a hurry.This day was a bit of a surprise because I have had better experiences here and at the Pasadena location before.  This is our last time. The management doesn't seem to care because I've tried to contact them several times without a response on their part.All this for $70!, to borrow from Yelp, ""Methinks not"".",92618

When we walked in there were 3 or 4 people unnecessarily standing around the hostess station. We were seated at a booth and immediately noticed that the leather seat had rice and grease all over it. My date was going to ask for us to be seated elsewhere, but then we noticed food, dirty utensils and used napkins underneath the table. At that point we decided to leave and on our way out noticed table after table that looked the same as the booth. I could not imagine eating at a restaurant that has such poor cleaning standards, and if this is what the front of the house looks like I can only imagine how disgusting the kitchen must be.",92618
940,"514 Spectrum Center Dr Irvine, CA 92618",Noel P.,"Orange County, CA",1/29/2016,1,"My boyfriend and I had a gift card so we went to the restaurant a few weeks ago.  It took a few minutes to be greeted - they were busy (we waited an hour).  We ordered a cup of soup and it literally took just over 20 minutes for just that to come.  I know because my boyfriend is diabetic and we keep track of when he tests his blood sugar and does insulin.  There was a couple that came 5-10 minutes after us that received all of their food before we even received the soup!  It was horrible.  Because we didn't have our food yet and we had plans afterward, plus our waitress was no where in sight, of course, I went back up to the host stand and inquired about our food/asked someone to check.  The host instructed us to sit back down and that she'd sent a manager over.  Five minutes later, a manager came over with our food, apologized, said he'd take it off the bill, and dashed off before we could say anything.  It was really awkward but ok - he knew they messed up, corrected it, and we had our food.  We left confused about what happened.  Unfortunately, because they took the food off our bill, we still had a good chunk of money to kill.  So, while we were at the Spectrum, my boyfriend and I went to P.F. Changs on Sat 1/16.  We waited 50 minutes to be sat, and we sat 2 tables over from where we sat before.  We got our waters and it took a while for the waitress to come back and take our order.  Again, patience, they were busy, but we were hungry.  We order, ask for the soup first, and look at the clock.  A big party gets sat next to us and orders a bunch of stuff.  They receive BOTH their appetizers and all their entrees BEFORE we even get our soup.  Totally unacceptable.  Our waitress never came by.  We were out of water.  I was hopeful that our food would come and it never did.  So disappointing and I was having a great time talking to my boyfriend, the last thing I wanted to do was wander around the restaurant to find someone to ask and cause a scene.  So when the soup finally comes but with all our other food, we say 'you know, that really took a long time (35 minutes) and that table ordered and got all their food before us.'  She said 'I know' and that she'd go talk to a manager.  She comes back and drops off our bill and then comes back to pick it up.  We told her that a manager never came over, and she said 'oh really?' and walks away.  Manager comes over - rude as hell.  Tall, thin, caucasian guy, don't know his name.  And he says, 'I hear there's been a problem.'  So I explain what happened and how the same thing happened last time and he says that he'll go check into it and make sure everything checks out.  Checks out?!  Are you freaking kidding me?  Our server even just admitted how long everything took.  Then he comes back and tells us, 'well you've only been sitting for an hour and 10 minutes' and said what time our food was rang in.  Yes thank you, I know how long we've been sitting and when we ordered.  We sat and ordered and the food got rang in the first 15 minutes, then we waited 35 minutes for it, scarfed it down in 10, dealt with the bill and wanted the hell out of here.  It was like he was totally invalidating the whole situation.  He was aggressive and insulting and we will never been coming back.  Aside from that, we've had to fight them every time on substituting the rice/quinoa for a vegetable because of my boyfriends diabetes.  Every other restaurant has no problem doing this, but P.F. Changs does for some reason.  We are a young couple and don't cook, so we dine out a lot and P.F. Changs has been horrible every single time.  Not only is the service bad, but we feel completely disrespected.  We are unimpressed by their management staff and conflict resolution.  Moral of the story, if you're looking for a nice, relaxing dinner, don't come here.  How dreadfully uncomfortable we've been.  And let's face it, you don't want to pay money go out somewhere like that.",92618

I gradually got busy within 15-20 minutes and our waiter didn't take our order til then (understandably that it is busy but it would have been nice to take our order in quicker especially we already knew what we wanted!) We ordered the Wonton Soup, which is good for 2 people (wontons, spinach, shrimp, mushrooms with a very light broth). I ordered the chicken lettuce wraps (a personal fave) and my boyfriend ordered the Monogolian Beef with brown rice! :) Overall great food and good atmosphere...I've order other items on the menu in the past and I would suggest getting the Stir Fy Eggplant, Crispy Honey Shrimp, and Kung Pao Scallops!Our bill came out to be about $40 including tip - a little pricey for a lunch but overall what's expected out of a bristro. I would rather go for dinner since they have this good deal ""For Two"" for $39. OH! I would high suggest to go to the P.F. Chang's website and sign up for free for their ""Warrior Card"" and they'll send you membership card in the mail (mind you, it is free) and presenting it at the time of payment, they'll knock off 10% off your bill!

I think the name PF Chang should be more like WTF Chang. You call that food and charged me $10 for that thing? Are you kidding me??? Ok. I went there today with whole bunch of coworkers for a birthday lunch. We faxed in the order first indicating we are trying to ""Minimize wait time"" and ""call me if there is any question"". But still end up waiting for at least 30 minutes to get our food. 2 of my coworkers had to make their lunch to go because they waited too long and really had to get back. But maybe there are many other reasons for the wait, so I don't want to be too picky on that. Now comes the food part and the worst part. I ordered a double pan-fried noodle with beef and that thing was drained in sauce. Personally I am someone with very heavy taste, ie. I add a lot of salt and butter in my popcorn. But man, there was just no way I can finish that noodle. it was like drinking salt water. At least 4 of my coworkers had the same problem with their dishes. I left there at around 12:30 and I can feel my tongue was a little numb. I've been drinking water ever since I came back to the office and am still drinking water.

Do NOT get the California roll. I ordered it with no avocado but it came with avocado. The server didn't come back for awhile so I had to grab someone to re-order another. The second time is arrived I had yet to receive any utensils or napkin. I waited for someone  to come around but at this point was holding up the rest of the table and had to get up and find someone to bring me utensils. Back to the roll....the rice was dry and the crab was dry (not even sure it was crab). They should really consider just removing this item from their menu. Also, a note on table maintenance. Please please please remove all plates, glasses, and utensils that are not being used. I can not stand when we get the bill yet all our used dishes are in the way. I'm not a huge fan of P.F.

960,"514 Spectrum Center Dr Irvine, CA 92618",Nathan A.,"Santa Ana, CA",5/8/2013,4,"It was my sons birthday and just like every year he gets to pick where the family eats. P.F. Chang's is a popular pick in this family so that is where we went. We went to the P.F. Chang's at the Irvine Spectrum because they recently remodeled and added new items to the menu. We ordered California rolls and heirloom tomato and Thai basil salad to start the meal. For our main course dishes we ordered Mongolian beef, grilled swordfish in pineapple chutney, Korean BBQ stir fry and a child's order of crispy honey chicken. These are not our typical menu selections, but I wanted to try some of the new menu items.   The starting dishes came to the table and I went for the tomato salad first. This salad was made with heirloom tomatoes, avocado, Thai basil and finished with a ponzu dressing. The tomatoes were plump and juicy, the avocado was creamy and rich, the basil and ponzo were a little kick to the taste buds. With my first bite of this salad I got a little bit of everything, in an attempt to make the perfect bite. The basil was prominent but the freshness of those tomatoes came through with the tang from the ponzu. I thought it was a great way to start the meal.  I am not huge fan of sushi or rolls of any type. These were ordered mainly for my wife and son but I did try one so I could comment on them. The rice was sticky and sweet. The small pieces of avocado and cucumber added texture. The seaweed added a tiny bit of saltiness to the roll and the crab was tender and not fishy. It was the best California roll I have ever personally had before. My sample of California rolls not being huge am I not sure how much that means but I did like it and would try it again. My son really liked them and ate most of them to himself. He discovered that with one of the dipping sauces provided to us that the roll was even better.  My daughter got the kids sized crispy honey chicken. She really likes this chicken and ate almost every piece. She said the honey sauce was sweet and the chicken was really crunchy. The hostess offered my daughter some child's learning chop sticks and my daughter loved using those. She was grabbing chicken, dipping it in the honey sauce and munching down with out hesitation. I was glad to see that she was enjoying her meal because sometimes it can be difficult to find something she likes. Unless it is a cheeseburger and fries.  When we go to P.F. Chang's we always share the main dishes so we all got a little bit of each. I tried the swordfish first because this was something I had never had before. When I first tasted the swordfish it had a real grilled flavor to it which made me think beef. The texture of swordfish was firm yet still flaky. As I continued to eat the swordfish a slight ocean fish taste started to come through but not anything that was overpowering or off putting. I was surprised how much I liked swordfish. My dad has told how much he likes it for years but not being a seafood eater I have never ordered it. Looks like I just may have to expand my pallet and try swordfish again. As for the rest of the family my wife also liked the swordfish and my son devoured almost the entire piece. It was a hit with us.  The Mongolian beef was awesome as always. This is a staple for us when we visit P.F. Chang's and never disappoints. The beef it self is tender but has some kind of coating on it that makes it a tiny bit crisp. The onions work perfectly with the sauce and beef. The Mongolian sauce is sweet but not cloyingly sweet. This dish did not last long at our table and will continue to be an easy choice for this family.  The Korean BBQ stir fry was another new item for us and the menu describes it as Korean-style chicken stir-fry with red peppers, onions and green beans in a sweet, spicy red chili sauce topped with a refreshing summer kimchi slaw. That sounded good to me but I got the spicy red chili sauce on the side. Not being a chili head I wanted to try this dish but not burn my mouth with heat. For me being able to control my level of heat was best and allowed me to still taste the chicken without reaching for drink after every bite. The pieces of chicken were coated in a batter that made the chicken crisp on the outside yet moist on the inside. The chicken was tender and cooked just right. The onions were barely cooked so they remained firm. The green beans appeared deep fried which made them delicate. The spicy sauce was spicy by it self but when dipping the chicken in the sauce it helped to cut through some of the spice but the heat still got me if I dipped too much. I did enjoy this dish and if you're a chili head I am sure you will really like it!",92618

BLAH.We all ordered one dish and I chose the walnut prawns - not that fantastic, the walnuts were few and i didnt really enjoy the melon balls glazed in some sweet stufff.  the coconut curry vegetables are the best we ordered.  it was delicious.  i've had better kung pao chicken which cost HALF as much!  the lemon pepper shrimp isn't worth mentioning.. and worst of all the double pan fried noodles beef IS SOOOO greasyyy and nasty...

It may not be authentic but I think PF does a pretty good job of harmonizing different flavors and pairing often unexpected tastes together, which I think really lies at the heart of Chinese cuisine: sweet-sour, savory-sweet, salty-spicy, etc.My only hang up about the PF chains is that prices can run a little steep for their average-sized portions, especially for the seafood dishes, but you're definitely getting a quality meal in a stylish setting that doesn't resemble the soggy heatlamp leftovers you get at your average Chinese hole-in-the-wall take-out.

We finally got a table at exactly 9:00 and I ordered the shrimp with lobster sauce and brown rice. It had shrimp, chestnuts, egg, and scallions. It was decent but it was a little too salty for me. It's probably because of the lobster sauce but I definitely needed more rice. Even if it wasn't salty, I wish they gave you more rice for what you pay for =(  As expected, the brown rice was hard and undercooked. I'm probably just spoiled because I make some bomb ass brown rice and the brown rice at Fukada off Irvine Center Drive is hella rad.The service was great, though. Our waiter was super cute (shhh, don't tell my boyfriend!) and we had a great time. I wish the music was just a little bit softer because we all had to yell at each other and lean in to hear.

Just like China! :)))Occasionally, one can in fact get utterly sick and tired of even the most authentic and fine Chinese Food. Guess how I know that? PF Chang's is no substitute for authentic Chinese cuisine, if you are looking for that.... however, it's a great substitute if you have had too much of it. Their ""American rendition"" of Chinese food is actually a nice break...as strange as that may sound.... but true. I've been to this location a few times. Service is generally good. Price is appropriate for the quality, location and ambiance. Food is consistent here, as it is with the other PF Chang's I've visited a couple of times before, at the Mission Viejo Mall.Great ambiance, a little dark, but very well done decor and interior design. They have an outdoor patio that opens up to the fountain in front of the theater entrances at Spectrum Mall.  Lots of space between tables. This is a very popular restaurant and the wait time is very long during peak hours. There is plenty of staff to deal with the high traffic though.We like:Crispy Fried NoodlesCrispy Honey ShrimpMongolian BeefCalamari AppetizerFried Dumplings, great sauce they provide to go with the dumplings.ORANGE CHICKEN/BEEF NOTE: As popular as these specific Chinese Dishes are, do not order them here....

We've now been twice to this one at the Spectrum and both times the food wasn't up to standards.  Last night had the fried green beans, dragon shrimp (i think that's what it was called), tuna, and won ton soup.  Beans OK, but extremely breaded compared to normal, hard to find the bean. Shrimp batter was doughy on the inside, not cooked enough.  Tuna wasn't good - tasted like refrigerator odors - sent that back immediately. Soup was good, no complaints there.All in all, they've been MUCH better in the past, but this is two strike outs in the last month at this location - me thinks its about time to take them off my list for awhile.  BTW - Service was fantastic, waiter was totally cool, but I'm there for the food.",92618

I'd say this place is like a high scale Panda Express. We started with the lettuce wraps and crab wontons. The lettuce wrap was okay. You have to make sure you eat it with the lettuce because it's way too salty. Crab wonton was okay, I wouldn't order it again. For entree, we did family style and had dan dan noodles, crispy honey shrimp, scallops, and beef and broccoli. They were all tasty, the only thing is the food is super super salty. My coworkers and everyone seemed to enjoy it, but they are the type to put soy sauce and salt on everything, you know, the American way. Crispy Honey Shrimp was sweet so it cancelled out the saltiness of everything else. Dan Dan Noodles were good too, but. again, noodles were salty so make sure you eat it with the cucumber slices. I'd come back for their happy hour. They seem to have a good drink variety with decent appetizers. Their strawberry/cucumber lemonade was really good.

However, while i do understand the food itself is prepared based upon a great deal of care and quality, the cost and taste seems to be in an average level.

The new decor is amazing and looks a lot different than the older versions. The new menu, while still diverse, seems more focused, is really innovative, and they have done a great job coming up with updated menu items and drinks. The best thing on the entire menu has to be the Chinese 5 Spice Duo of DUCK! I've never been too into ordering duck on a menu because I usually go with the tried and true items that I know are delicious, but this duck rocks!!! SO good. It is much different than the other duck they had, this one comes with this dried cherry-ginger sauce (chutney) that is unbelievable!!! It was so good that it motivated me to write a review. Trust me, go check it out:). I think my other favorites have to be the Stir-fried Eggplant (my favorite veggie dish no doubt), the Lettuce Wraps (always a great choice) and I love how they rearranged the drink menu so that it's really easy to find what you want.

The place was busy, the hostess told me about a 30 minutes wait, I said ok and gave them my cell number to text me, after waiting 45 minutes, I approached the hostess and asked how I was doing with my wait, she could not find my name or number in their system, finally she found it and told me another 20 minutes, not happy but I waited. I watched as people came in and then left once they were told it was now and hour and a 1/2 wait.  so now I am there for an hour and 15 minutes for my 30 minute wait, I approach the hostess again, she tells me 5-10 more minutes, I explain to her I have been waiting over an hour for a 30 minute wait, within 5 minutes, I have a table. the waitress was wonderful, friendly and attentive, the food was great, as it always it. summary, get rid of the two girls pretending to be a hostess and hire someone with skills as a hostess.

I had the following dishes with my boyfriend:-Hot and Sour Soup & Chicken Noodle Soup were decent. -Salt and Pepper Calamari was a little too salty for my taste buds. -The Crispy Honey Shrimp, my favorite entree, was well cooked and it was bursting with flavor.   -Mongolian Beef was slightly overcooked and bland.-The  delicious cream cheese and tiramisu mini dessert came in shot glasses. This restaurant originally appealed to me it was overcrowded and it had an upscale atmosphere. Was the long wait worth it? Not quite, but my waitress was very kind throughout the whole evening.

I got the lobster fried rice... big mistake, it was very spicy, I could barely eat it and the lobster was fried itself too, I didn't realize it would be (I've never, ever had spicy fried rice anywhere).  My stomach hurt all night with it. My daughter who loves California rolls didn't like them at all, but my son loved the Mongolian beef.  You can't please everyone but next time I'll try something different, I guess.  Very crowded an slow service but not too bad.  I used to absolutely love their warm bbq chicken salad they used to carry at another location in Texas years ago!",92618

I enjoy reading other people's opinion of things but I got to agree on majority of reviews in here. I went with my friend 2 weeks after they reopened. I was excited to go since it is one my favorite restaurant to go to prior to there remodel. The service was always great then. When we got seated, the first thing the hostess said  was there is no kids menu but did recommend some dishes that my god son would probably like. Sounds good.  Then the waiter came did not know the menu too well we had questions he could not answer. We asked about the special they have, at first he said the soup was included then came back with our meal to tell us that it is not included. Service overall was pretty terrible compared to the previous times we went there prior to remodeling. I just let this incident go for now since they did just reopen and probably the waiter was new. Anyway, I was meeting up with another friend who wants to give the place a try. Since it has been several months...What the heck. I will give it another chance. We did the deal for $39.98 for two. It said on the menu quite clearly in a separate box  what is included on this deal. It did raise a red flag when I saw the Sea bass is included in this box. Since it is a pricier item. So I asked the waiter to be sure that it is one of the item that is included. He definitely said yes and he said they will be probably be a couple of bucks ""Up charge"" . So we were rest assured and ordered the sea bass. The dish was good. Can't complain about it. The other thing we ordered under the special is the Mango chicken. Not so great. The service this time was better, but the drawback was when we got the bill it seemed too high, plus everything was itemized and did not look like we got the $40 deal at all (+ a couple of bucks for the sea bass). James was made aware. Tried to explain what he did but did not make sense. The Bill was 15 dollars over, NOT a ""couple of Bucks"" more. So after a few minutes the manager came to the table gave us another receipt with just 2 dollars off from the previous bill the waiter printed out. He admitted that it is completely their error to have the sea bass placed inside the box where the special is being offered, but he cannot honor the $2.00 up charge that the waiter told us bec. Sea bass is so expensive and they will lose money.  HUH!I worked on food service myself for 10 years...never would have treated a costumer like this.STAY AWAY......",92618

At the end when we had finished our meal, I had to flag down a different server to ask for our bill.  Three different people came by to our table to apologize because they could tell we had been abandoned and that our server was not present at all.   The manager got involved and apologized for her staff member.  She was very nice about it but to be honest she didn't go over the top to try and make things right.  We were given a free desert.  Not that I wasnt grateful for it but I go to PF Changs quite often for friends birthdays and celebrations, and they always comp the table a free desert.  The sad part of all this was that we went there to celebrate my birthday which was in a couple of days and although the food was good, we left there disappointed because we had unacceptable customer service.",92618

It was obvious that the all-new crew was still learning during our first visit, weeks after their opening; food runners were frantically looking for tables, and delivering to the wrong customers. Thankfully, our 1st server (who displayed much at-ti-TUDE) was replaced by a very personable server. Outside of being seated in an area I didn't particularly like, the food was enjoyed more than we expected!During our following visit, we sat at a high-top table outside. Love the new look, the location, and the atmosphere of the place -- outside (especially) and inside (except for the back by either of the kitchen doors)!

So my buddy and I switched to beer and finished out the night.  The manager eventually comped a few items by way of apology and made us feel better, but I worry about how many other folks had our experience that week.What I saw while waiting was a totally untrained/unpracticed bar staff and a total lack of communication with the servers.  Bartenders seemed to make one drink at a time.  Mixers were not in speed bottles, but had to be unscrewed, used, recapped and returned to the shelf during the pour.  It kinda looked like cousin Ricky acting as the bartender at someone's backyard wedding reception. I'm pretty sure that these things will work themselves out with time, but in the hyper-competitive environment of the Irvine Spectrum during a recession dropping the ball like that was bad mojo.  I'll re-review after a few weeks when we go back and let y'all know if it is working better or not.",92618

1055,"514 Spectrum Center Dr Irvine, CA 92618",McKenzie R.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",12/6/2012,5,"It's no wonder why P.F. Chang's has become one of the most well-known, widely popular food chains. The restaurant is all over the world creating a lively, fun, and infectious atmosphere with the iconic horse greeting you at the door, but still each individual restaurant having a unique quality about itself. The chain I attend most often is the Irvine Spectrum location. It has newly been re-modeled and looks better than ever. This individual re-model has set the standards higher for all the other locations to live up to because of the new and improved seating capabilities, service, and loudness of the overall restaurant. My only concern is how the other locations are going to be able to pull off successful improvements to theirs as well. Before the re-model of the Irvine location, the restaurant had a very poor customer satisfaction rate and the customer's biggest complaint being that the restaurant was too loud and everyone at the table had to speak over each other because of the music being played in the background.  There are similar complaints at some of the other locations as well. However, since the re-model the place has been booming with business. It is in a perfect location, right in the midst of a shopping center, and has the regular customers as well as a new scene of younger people checking out the extremely tasteful food. The prices range anywhere between $7.00-$14.00 which is why the restaurant does so well, especially among the younger crowd who can afford a small plate or splurge a little and order a larger chicken dish. It is also very easy to split a dish and still be satisfied which is another plus for the reasonable price column.  There are definitely some ""must-have"" items on the menu that P.F. Chang's has done a great job to highlight but still feel okay to order a less common dish. These signature dishes include: the appetizer, Chang's Chicken Lettuce Wraps, the main dishes, Mongolian Beef and Chang's Spicy Chicken, followed by the most famous thing on their menu, the mini-dessert spread. Order that and you're sure to fall in love instantaneously with the restaurant and it's quality. The food melts in your mouth and leaves a little tang to hang on to. If you want to step out of the box a little bit, my absolute favorite thing to order is the Crispy Green Beans to start, the Shrimp with Candied Walnuts as the main entrée and to top it off with The Great Wall of China mini-dessert. But no matter what it is you order, you'll eat a dash of fire only to cool off with whatever the side rice dish may be. Sitting in the restaurant, I can smell all of the different Asian food items coming together in one pan and hear the sizzling of the cooking, the only thing between the food and fire being the pan. The greatest touch of all is putting a large glass wall between the kitchen and the restaurant so the customers can see the effort it takes to make the food so enjoyable. The hostess' are all very pleasing to talk to and it is very evident that they take the time to care about each and every customer that sets foot in their work place. Overall, this is by far one of my favorite restaurants to go to. I'm hungry and excited to eat when I walk through the door and more than satisfied and still excited because of the wonderful experience I had when I walk out. It is pleasing to all weather you want to sit inside, outside, by a fireplace, or at the bar; P.F. Chang's can accommodate it all. And if there is ever an issue between a customer and food or customer and staff member, they always go out of their way to make sure the consumer leaves feeling better than when they walked in no matter how much effort that may take.

But on the other hand they do have one of the best hot and sour soups around. it has a chicken base instead of pork and has the right balance between hot and sour. i just wish they had brown crunchy noodles to go with it. i also like their appetizers and entrees and the service is first rate. they will happily special order, no prob.  since the remodel it is much easier to get seating for the evening service. no msg. if you understand going in that this is an asian fusion - pac rim joint, then you will be ok.

It's a long story of ups and downs, so brace yourself.I had the responsibility of ordering food for my company Christmas party, and P.F. Changs was the restaurant of choice. I called and spoke to their manager, Melisa, who was really nice and helpful. She sent me over a menu for large party ordering. Full trays serve 15 and Half trays serve 8.  Perfect. Melissa helped me decide how much food to order to feed 80 people. ""Wow, that was so easy"" I thought to myself. She told me that I should wait to order, since I was calling just over a week in advance, so I waited and ordered on Friday, the party was set for Wednesday.Tuesday morning, I'm told we will have 90 people at the party, so I called P.F. Changs to add some more food. Melisa wasn't there, so I spoke to Brian. Again, very nice and helpful, except Brian tells me that full trays only serve 10 people.  ""Well crap"", I say, "" I'll need to order more food"". So, Brian helps me decide how much food I need for 90 people. We come to a final order and he assures me that everything will go smoothly and he will be the opening manger Wednesday morning.Wednesday morning, the day of the party, I called at 9:00 AM to confirm my order and that it will be ready to pick-up at 11:30. Brian throws in this bomb, ""Oh, we actually changed our menu, and we might have a problem. You see, we no longer have full trays. We only have half trays. But, we decided to keep the price of the full tray and charge that for the half tray, which only serves 5 people. Yeah, so you only have enough food for 45 people. Oooopsie."" W.T.F""So, now I only have half the amount of food that I ordered with you YESTERDAY and you are going to charge me double??""""""Yeah, I'm really sorry about that""""Yeah, but the party is today""""I know, I'm sorry""""But.....""While Brian continued to fake apologize to me and act like this was no big deal, I panicked and dragged my boss into the whole mess. We yelled, he apologized, we yelled more and then he put us on hold. Waiting.Waiting.Waiting.Brian comes back on the line and finally admits his mistake and some other bull shit how they changed the menu two weeks ago and says that he will honor our original pricing and get us enough food for 90 people. We ended up getting juuuuuust enough food.",92618

1065,"514 Spectrum Center Dr Irvine, CA 92618",Jessica D.,"Costa Mesa, CA",1/23/2012,2,"Let me start off by saying I used to work for P.F. Changs (Newport Beach location) & understand how this company holds their employee standards VERY high & that the latest remodel of their Irvine location makes this place an absolutely GORGEOUS and fun environment to dine in!! The indoor/outdoor bar is a fresh idea and it seemed like there was something beautiful to look at everywhere I glanced. The slightly see-through back wall where you can see the kitchen preparing your food also adds to the sweet vibe. They certainly paid a pretty penny for whoever was the designer. NOW, a far as compliments go, that's about it (with the exception of the delicious wanton soup!!) Our first impression with the staff was AWFUL...there was NO wait, but were given EXTREME attitude by the hostesses. First we were told that our table was being cleaned & would be ready shortly...we waited 20 minutes while the 3 hostesses kept glancing our way (obvious they were speaking about us) & we watched the OVER ABUNDANCE of servers just standing around & joking with each other. One of the hostesses then proceeded to tell us that the table that we were to be sat at didn't have a server now?? (The table was in the middle of the floor & was surrounded by other full tables, I work in the food industry & understand a servers section PERFECTLY, this girl was clearly lying to me as the people sitting there had just left & obviously had a server) Then we were told after another 10 minutes of waiting that the table was STILL being cleaned. Obviously frustrated now at the 3 different stories I was just told (mind you, there was NO wait at this time!!!), I asked the rude hostess if there was a problem, she proceeded to gesture rudely in my face & refused to give a straight answer on why we haven't been sat yet.  I was so shocked, at the unprofessionalism at this girl & the words coming out of her mouth it crossed my mind on how the standards must have dropped SIGNIFICANTLY since I worked for the company. FINALLY seated!!!  :)   Yet,  we had 4 different servers throughout our meal...very confusing...again, OVER ABUNDANCE of servers & wait staff just standing around chatting in groups (even with managers) with not enough to do apparently. The chicken lo mein (my fav) was god awful!!! The noodles tasted like they had been frozen & refrozen then overcooked. They were ""slimy"" and left a disgusting aftertaste in my mouth. I know how P.F. Changs prepares & expects their food to taste & this was NOT it!! YUCK!!Ok, meal is over...just have to run to the restroom real quick before leaving...again, BEAUTIFULLY re-done, but the bathroom was NOT maintained!! Trash cans were overflowing & the stall I was in had toilet paper & shredded seat covers ALL over the floor. Something you'd expect more out of a gas station restroom, not a high end restaurant. Had to take a picture because it was so laughably bad!!All in all, NOT a good impression guys!!!  It will be a LONG time before I give this place a chance again. Next time, we'll go to the Fashion Island location. At least there, we'll get good food & treated with respect     ;)",92618

1070,"514 Spectrum Center Dr Irvine, CA 92618",Jeannie B.,"Cerritos, CA",7/27/2011,2,"So I came here to grab dinner and decided to go with the 3 course meal for 2 people for 39.99 since it seemed to be a better deal than ordering two separate entrees that would've probably added up to about $35+..Started off with the salt and pepper squid. If you've ever had authentic Chinese calamari then you're gonna HATE this appetizer from pf changs.The squid was lacking in flavor and looked like deep fried worms rather than pieces of squid. The salt and pepper were on the side along with a brown sauce and when the squid was dipped into both it was just too overpowering and salty, but without any sauces it was so bland!Our appetizer had come out quickly, but our entrees took about 20 minutes to come out. I ordered the crispy honey shrimp and they were far from crispy. In fact they were soggy, as if they had been sitting on the plate for a while. The flavor was A-OK, but not worth ordering again. And for Dessert i ordered the mini red velvet cheesecake and great wall of china...and they were SUPER mini. I finished the dessert in literally 3 bites..seriously? I paid 40 bucks plus tip for all this? On top of that the waiter we had was so busy with other customers he would forget to fill up our water even though we had asked a few times. Overall I feel l like this place is way too overrated. I would much rather go to panda express or get some authentic chinese food for WAY less and it would probably taste better than here.",92618

They just don't check in guests not in those areas.

We informed our server of the issue and he offered to bring us something else, so we opted for the honey chicken. They got it out to us in under five minutes and it was cooked and seasoned to perfection. It is a rare thing for us to ask for another meal but, if we had not, our experience would not have been as excellent. Their superb customer service and speed made it a great meal!",92618

You know there is no I in team so I got to play my part. Their food has very little to do with Chinese food but more on the Americanize side. The food is salty and greasy. The hot and sour soup which tasted like a soy sauce reduction. It was so thick and salty that I had to go through a whole glass of water trying to finish a bowl of soup. Since I can not sit there and stare at my coworkers while they eat, I would recommend the following AVERAGE dishes: Chicken Lettuce Wrap, Mongolian Beef, Chang's Spicy Chicken.

Changs, oh how we quarrel.  This love/hate, delicious/mediocre relationship we have is quite difficult to handle.  Yes, your duck makes me forgive you everytime, but your kung poa chicken makes me cheat on you.  I dont know if I can do this anymore.          Well, I was heading to the Verizon Wireless Ampitheatre, to see Dave Matthews Band (and yes, be jealous) and needed to stop for dinner beforehand.  My lovely date (again, be jealous) likes chinese and I thought of that duck, that delicous, tender, perfectly sauced, duck.  There was no turning back now.  We entered the beautiful establishment and immediately felt at least 2.7 times classier than before, they really do decorate beautifully.  We were seated quickly and our host even had a busser clean off a table so we could have a booth, which I greatly appreciated.  We had to wait a tad longer than we should have to for our server, but she had a busy section and I was quite distracted by the before-mentioned hottie next to me so I didnt care really.           We ordered our drinks, I got a bottle of Pelligrino, and yes I realize that is the #1 non-alcoholic drink for douche-bags, but it is delicious and I was riding this new found pseudo-classiness for as long as I could.  They now have this new 2 person four course meal for 39ish dollars, which is really a great deal for this place!  The options are slightly limited, but you will receive two soups, one app, two entrees, and two shot glass desserts.  The soup options are the Egg drop soup and the other is the Hot and Sour soup.  We just got one of each to try.  The Egg Drop was delicious, like a chinese version of chicken noodle soup.  The Hot and sour although, was quite salty which kind of killed any of the flavor.  Needless to say we ended up splitting the Egg Drop before the app came.             For the appetizer, they have more options and I can only remember the crab wontons and chicken lettuce wraps for right now.  Thats because I secretly wanted the Crab wontons, but to accomodate the less adventurous foxey-lady with me, I chose the lettuce wraps which are consistently good.  (Thats how you know you love someone by the way!)  They were good, lettuce cold and crisp with the warm chicken makes a wonderfully light and delicous app.           Entree decision time came and she chose the sweet and sour chicken (She has a thing for chicken, I know... I know....We'll talk.)  But this time, she outsmarted me, for I got the Kung Pao Chicken.  This is the equivalent of the Seattle Seahawks entire organization, forgettable at best.  The sweet and sour chicken on the other hand was as good as hearing Tom Brady's ACL snap, along with his career as a cheater.(Too harsh? Too soon?)  The Kung Pao was just eh, lots of spice without flavor and peanuts and other filler.  It kinda sat there while I stole her sweet and sour chicken (Dont forget, this is before I take her to see dave matthews, the best band ever, I could have gotten away with murder!).  Hers was sauced perfectly and still a little crispy with delicious vegetables and pinneaple.  So they broke even with one being good and the other being eh.          Then came dessert, where they bring a rack of little shot glass desserts and you choose one.  Be warned if you grab one, they are quite fake and you will look like a complete fool.  Almost as lame as someone drinking Pelligrino.  I was guilty of both so my classiness level was dropping faster than the Broncos hopes for playoffs last season.  Regardless, I got the cheesecake which was one of the top 5 cheesecakes I've had, while the much classier date got the double chocolate cake.  I wish so badly mine wasn't in a shot glass, but alas, they were a perfect size if you were full.  All in all, not a terrible experience, and not the best there is.  We made it out of there for around 60 dollars with tip and tax and drinks.  On to Dave.",92618

Forget chopsticks, I didn't even bother asking by the time we get our food. I recognize that she was being let down by other people on the staff (the hot and sour soup never came out and when she brought it it was so bad we had to send it back), and I appreciate that she took it off our bill on her own accord and offered to bring us the egg drop. The food itself was not up to par for the most part. The crab wontons and spicy eggplant were tasty, but the other dishes were either over-salted or over-sauced, or just lacked in some element.

So FInally our original server came back from break and he had the ice cream in a to go container for us- I guess there was a bit of miscommunication between the servers who took over during his break. Nonetheless we scored some extra ice cream.  :)  One more thing worth mentioning...Be careful on your way into the restroom.

Also, the waiter forgot to bring out one of our dish and the manager put it on his tab, they are very generous and lenient to customers complaints. The waiter was really friendly but to a point that it started wasting our time. He spent around 5min talking to the table next to us about his personal life while we were waiting for our to go boxes, he then realized and told the customers on the table next to us to wait and he'll be back after getting our to go boxes, but he did not bring enough... so he had to go back and get more AND get our check.

Very professional and approachable.The first time I came here was on a first date with my now-spouse. On our first date 3 years ago, I wanted to surprise her with flowers, and the manager made it a priority that he brought out the flowers at the right time, and that our date went well.We returned on our 1st anniversary of dating, and my digital camera died when I asked him to take our picture. I regretted having not charged the battery. He saw that I was trying to make it a good anniversary date, and I was trying not to show my embarrassment. 10 minutes later he came back with a disposable camera he had bought from a kiosk---no charge to us!. He apologized that it ""wasn't the best"", but my girl and I were so impressed by his thoughtfulness. We had wanted to tell the manager that we were so pleased and we asked our waiter ""Who is the guy in the suit who seats everyone?"" because we thought this nice guy was just a host. The waiter informed us he was the manager (we always saw him previous times and never knew it). A very memorable experience---- excellent customer service!

It's alright, not amazing, and way overpriced.Some sales representatives wanted to take my supervisor and our team out for lunch, and they picked this place. Free meal, why not? I got the sesame chicken lunch bowl. I thought it was okay. It tasted more like a sweet and sour chicken than sesame chicken, and had way more veggies than it did chicken. I actually really like the lettuce wraps here and the kung pao chicken. That's what I usually order, but I wanted to try something new that day. Should've just stuck to my usual! I wanted to get the lunch portion though because it comes with a bowl of soup and it's a smaller portion than the normal dinner portions.Try the plum wine! It's yummy!I generally avoid the Spectrum on weekends altogether because of how busy the whole place gets. PF Chang's is no exception. A 2 hour wait is pretty typical for a Friday night. Who would wait 2 hours for overpriced fake Chinese food? I don't know. Panda Express is another option if you like that!

We ordered about 10 different dishes so trust me we had a huge selection to taste and none of them were any good on a scale of 1-10 in taste they were all 1. I don't get it. I don't think any actual Chinese person would or should eat here. Not if you expect to eat anything close to good/authentic tasting chinese food. Everything was either too salty, too overly breaded, heavy on the sauces. I honestly thought I had just taken my family to a very expensive version of Panda Express.

Well.. We gave her our orders and we were ready for our full orders. I felt so terrible as when I was giving her the order she kept asking 'excuse me what do you mean? Although I speak a very good English and I have been teaching in English for 11 years back home, yet my accent was different! And she was doubting each order and saying 'oh we don't have that ' even for a simple word like (shrimp)!!! And when the drinks were served, the kids soda was full of ice and when we asked her to change it she replied next time tell me about it before and she was so angry! 2 orders were wrong and when we told the other waiter he told her and we could see her from the mirror waving her hands and pointing on us and it was clear that she was so pissed ! and in the end she charged us 42 dollars extra!

1127,"514 Spectrum Center Dr Irvine, CA 92618",HAnne D.,"Ladera Ranch, CA",8/5/2009,2,"We used to be regulars here. Back when the Spectrum was a quarter of the size it is today. We were thrilled to live down the street a Chang's, having fallen in love with the food and service at the Fashion Island location.But time's change, and we evolve, and hopefully for the better. Well, we did; Chang's, however, did not.Service was mediocre at best. We placed our drink orders, and waited and waited and waited... even as we saw our refreshing concoctions sitting on the edge of the bar waiting for us. That didn't set a good tone for service. Indeed, the service was fairly slow all evening, although our waitress was sweet and polite. Having said that, I'd give a thumb's up to the organic agave margaritas, which were pretty good, tasty, and refreshing. We ordered the lettuce wraps. It's one thing Chang's still *nails*. Crunchy, yummy, tasty flavors all meld in a leaf of iceberg lettuce. It's nothing fancy or gourmet, but it tastes pretty damn good. We asked for the sauce to be mixed spicy, but I wasn't impressed at all with the spice level.The table ordered Pepper Steak, Kung Po Chicken, Ma Po Tofu, Chang's Special Chicken and Pork Fried Rice. The rice was ok but not well seasoned; it was not especially flavorful unless you got a piece of pork in it. The tofu dish came with steamed (read: mushy) broccoli. It probably was overly reheated, as the veggie had retained its vibrant green color (in other words, they probably cooked a whole night's worth of broccoli, and then shocked the veggies to keep the color, but then reheated the portion to its mushy state). The spice level was pretty good, but the sauce was a bit too sweet for the dish for my liking, and the tofu appeared to have been deep fried. Not traditional.Chang's Special Chicken had an excellent heat-spice level, but it the sauce was a bit on the sweet side. The steak dish had nice flavor, though it seemed to be more onions and peppers than meat. And the sauce was overly gloppy and thick. The Kung Po was pretty good, especially since it was the only dish that wasn't swimming in a thick, overly sweet sauce. I'd say the heat level was only a medium, but it had big ol' chunks of chicken. I'll give 'em credit for that!Overall, the restaurant seems to have become a bit Americanized - or maybe I've been fortunate to find some awesomely authentic Asian food elsewhere in Irvine. The flavors and over-sauced dishes are very reminiscent of something you'd find in one of those chain fast-food Asian places (like Panda Express). I expected more than that from Chang's, and they let me down. It's been a long time since I've been to Chang's, and I was glad to go back - it brings back fond memories. But I think I can check it off my list for a long time. I'd definitely go back for my guilty pleasure of lettuce wraps, but if I want Chinese/Asian, there are way too many other, better choices around.",92618

We went for drinks, apps and possible entres with a group of about 20 so we sat in the bar. There are these really long tables that were perfect untill a coven of 4 yellow teethed aging divorcees flew in on sticks and took over half of the table and refused to let us sit in any of he emplty seats within spellcasting range. (Keep in mind It's an open seating bar area) so after words with Broom Hilda and her sisters the manager graciously allowed them to hold seats for imaginary people that never showed up and alowed us to split our party into two groups. Thanks for the Kiddie Table Mr Manager, I feel so much better now. Enough about the that.  The thing I look for most when going to a restaurant is the service. Considering what we just went through you would hope they would try to make it up to us some how, which they did by ignoring us for about an hour. I could have flaged down our waiteress but at this point I really wasn't in the mood for food anymore and was more entertained watching our waitress walk past our table and avoid eye contact about half a dozen times as she waited on all the tables around us. She even started bussing dishes instead of checking on us. We did order drinks and appetizers over the course of being there but like a previous review stated, the food is simply repackaged Panda Express. and really expensive at that. I had a drink called a Dark & Spicy that was good but $9 for a shot of rum and juice is ridiculous. I do get the fact that it is at the Spectrum so you can't expect much but if a group of 20 came into a retaurant I owned, my eyes would light up with Dollar Signs $$. They lost at least $300 on the tab on the Waitress lost probably $75 in tip just because they didn't service us well and we all lost our appetites dealing with everything.

He handed our table over to a girl that apparently forgot all about us. We had our soup and app going good with the original waiter but we had to get the new servers attention to ask her to bring us our main entree because we had waited forever for it. We ended up having to scarf it down and got the rest boxed to go. We had to ask our original server when he got back from break to refill our water, because the girl never came to check on us.

Chang's Mothership since it was my first experience w/ PF Chang's Asian Fusion style menu. I don't always stop when driving from LA to San Diego, but I have stopped enough times to have eaten here at least a dozen times over the years. Many years. I stopped this time on my way to LA. I wanted some vegetarian lettuce wraps, so I pulled off the 405/5 into the Irving Spectrum. Soon I was seated at the bar, greeted by the friendly bartender and an attractive waitress. P.F. Chang's really hires young and good looking waitresses. OK, what does this have to do with food? Nothing. I digress; it's just atmosphere. Anyway, I ordered white tea and the lettuce wraps, and looked at the menu and something else caught my eye: The Salmon steamed w/ginger, served over stir-fried shiitake mushrooms, tomatoes and asparagus, so I went for it. It was very good, but a little too salty for my taste. Since salt is my kryptonite, I couldn't eat the whole entree. I grabbed a doggie bag to take the leftovers, and polished it off later during the evening. It was a bit pricier than I expected, since I usually go for two orders of lettuce wraps, but not outrageous. I have had better experiences here when I was with a small group of friends, so I will not go down to 3 stars for the salt. BTW, they do have a good selection of Single Malts here, but this was a day time visit and I don't drink before 5PM.",92618

I asked the hostess for a table for 2 and she said just wait for a few minutes. So I sat down with my girl to one of those benches for waiting customers.  My girl complained to me that the hostess eye-balled her 2 times and this really irritated her. Five minutes passed and there was no update or anything. So I talked to hostess and said I spoke to her earlier regarding a table for 2. She asked for my name and I told her you did even earlier. This hostess seemed to be on lala land or did not want to be there. During this time, another customer spoke to hostess. The hostess almost gave our table to this customer. This customer told the hostess that I was ahead of her. Now comes the best part. So we got seated. Waitress comes over asked drinks. This waitress never made a single eye contact with me. Then my girl ordered an alcoholic drink. The waitress asked for her ID. My date said ""seriously?"". The waitress then said yes ""seriously"". Then I kinda played along and said ""seriously"". Next thing I know, this waitress says ""Yes seriously, and you need to be slapped for that"". Who talks that way to customers? This waitress was too fresh. I am a guy and don't easily offended, but if I were the waitress, I'd be really careful in what I say to customers, otherwise it can rub them the wrong way.  This waitress had a short hair, almost platinum blonde/blonde hair, tattoos on right arm, and looked like a lesbian. So with the hostess bad experience plus this incompetent waitress, that was enough for me and told my date we're leaving. Avoid this waitress and hostess if you can. What an unpleasant experience for a stupid ass Chinese restaurant.",92618

We used to go after the gym, to try & put on all the calories we'd just burned. Well the new layout & decor are great with an expanded & covered outdoor patio area, perfect for people watching. We had a great server who quickly to our drink order, which was for the new signauture Dragon Martini & a glass of Pinot Grigio all part of their new Triple happiness Happy Hour. Well 30 min later after numerous trips to the bar our server advised me that they can't make my martinin as they were out of stock of some of the ingredients. This then turned into 45 min for a replacement cocktail & the wine. I had to complain to the management, 45 min for a glass of wine & a few cocktails to arrive can kill a bar in this area, due to so much competition within a few yards of them. The Manager came over & did comp most of our bill as there were 5 of us there, that was the least he could do . He said he would look into the matter & make some changes to speed things up at the bar. Besides my wait for drinks everything else was great the new Happy Hour Food menu items were great & the ambience added to the experience.

The service can be sketchy at times in any given location but my visit here was pleasant.

Something was just ""off"" Our menus sat on our table while we ate our appetizers, we had no silverware and at the point we still had not ordered dinner. We got the Honey Shrimp & Mongolian Beef. Both great but not the best I've had. I also ordered a glass of wine and did not taste like what I ordered at all. . . disappointed but I grinned through it since the thought of something sweet and a little shopping after made me happy, excited and wanting to get out of there. My other little pet peeve is as we were leaving the little hostess cut me off instead of patiently waiting for us to leave. . .the best part is as we left and she cut me off I got the dirtiest look. . .I laughed.

We each ordered 1 drink and it took an additional 12 minutes for those. There were 3 other tables in the entire restaurant and the bartender was just chatting away with 2 servers that were off sitting at the bar. The server asked us 3 times what food we wanted and we told him 3 times that we were just having drinks and he rolled his eyes. We also over heard him talking about how annoying it was that we just ordered drinks in the lounge with no food with another server. Terrible experience!

Our server was Miranda, and she was great. So was the food. The apps were delicious and plentiful, and the kung pao shrimp was awesome. So why only 2 stars? Because the experience got worse with each subsequent visit. The second time we got an incredibly polite server who was as slow as molasses. They were busy that night, and he let us know that the fact we were seated in the bar area was making his job harder because we were so far from the kitchen. When we wanted to take home what was left of our meal, he brought us the containers and said, ""I normally don't ask my customers to box up their own food..."" then left us with the containers to do the work ourselves. So, we figured this was an anomalous situation, and returned last night to enjoy their great happy hour deal. We got there 10 min before it ended, and were told we couldn't be seated until after happy hour, but we could go to the bar, which we did. And our experience there is what prompted this review. As we sat, the male bartender--white, glasses, beard--completely ignored us. He continually passed us to cater to the person sitting right next to us. Didn't glance our way a single time. And the female bartender wasn't much better. She started going around telling everyone it was last call for happy hour, and she, too, ignored us. It was actually surreal to be treated as if we were invisible. When we complained, the very nice manager seated us at a table and offered us happy hour prices. But at no point after that did she check on us. And when I got my wine, I received less than half a glass, while folks at the bar and other tables got fuller pours. At that point, I pretty much wrote off PF Chang's as an option, which is such a shame because we really like the food and it is right across the street.",92618

We placed our ordered of strawberry lemonades, vegetarian lettuce wraps, Buddha's feast stir fried, vegetable fried rice without egg, and signature lo mein with vegetables.Before she left to place our food order, we informed Mao of hubby's severe nut alley to which Mao replied that she would make sure the chefs were aware of the tree nut allergy and that hubby's food would be cooked in a separate area.Our appetizer of vegetarian lettuce wraps arrived first and was a simple yet flavorful dish. The lettuce wrap filling was savory but light and the side sauce was the perfect addition to the appetizer.  Shortly thereafter, the rest of our food arrived and just as delicious as our appetizer. All of the food was fresh, well seasoned and perfectly cooked.

24,"1145 Newport Center Dr Newport Beach, CA 92660",Timmy S.,"Trabuco Canyon, CA",6/20/2019,4,"P.F. Chang's is admittedly one of my guilty pleasures. It's not Chinese but a very Americanized spin on Asian dishes. And for whatever reason I personally enjoy the flavors of their food...or at least the three dishes I never stray from ordering.I had made reservations on a Sunday afternoon for lunch. I was called the morning of the reservation for confirmation. Upon arrival I was seated immediately. I will say that our server, Laina, provided the best service I've ever had at any P.F. Chang's and was in the league of the best I've ever experienced. This definitely elevated the dining experience.We first ordered the lettuce wrap appetizer. I absolutely love the fresh, crisp lettuce and the mixture of ground chicken, onion, water chestnut and crispy rice noodles doused in their secret sauce which you fill the lettuce cups with. Along with a bowl of white rice we ordered the Mongolian beef and orange peel chicken. The beef was tender as was the chicken. Both are covered in sauces that my taste buds go crazy for. The thinly sliced beef has some sort of slightly spicy sweet-salty bbq sauce and the chicken in a citrusy-slightly spicy coating. Also enjoyed my ginger beer. Of all the P.F. Chang locations I've been to this one is undoubtedly the best (if you can get past the headache of Fashion Island's hellish weekend parking).",92660

I understand through the grapevine that in the next month (ish) that corporate has decided to take about 40 items off the menu! Many of the most popular items such as orange chicken, chicken soup, etc... I do not think this is in the best interest of your customers. The main reason we come here so often is 1) the great service 2) the great food choices, and 3) the fact that it might be a corporation, but it doesn't feel like it. Shame on the higher ups who are probably not ""foodies"", but penny pinchers. My guess is that this is probably the beginning of the end (just my hunch) for PF Changs. What a bummer :(",92660

51,"1145 Newport Center Dr Newport Beach, CA 92660",carrie r.,"Newport Beach, CA",6/12/2019,1,"BAIT AND SWITCH COUPON FRAUD!!!Tonight my Dad and I dined at the Newport Beach location intending to use the attached coupon. It specifically states the only parameters to its use is to purchase ""any dine in entree, limit one redemption per day per table"". We were careful to read all the details stated on the coupon and ordered the Wok Wednesday vegetable fried rice special which was supposed to be half price. The waitress was aware and mentioned what a great deal we were getting. Nowhere on the coupon does it state that the entree you purchase must be a full price entree, or that it couldn't be combined with another offer. We were then surprised when our bill came and we were charged full price for the vegetable fried rice entree. At first the waitress said they were having problems with the cash register applying the discounts to the daily specials (so be sure to check your receipts!!). However, the manager Stephanie then refused to give the discount on the fried rice. She agreed our coupon didn't say we had to purchase a full price entree, but said her separate company internal documents (that only management is privy to), said it has to be a full price entree. Stephanie obviously has no idea CA LAW states all details for a coupons use must be printed *on the coupon. A company cannot add additional conditions on its use on an ""internal document"". This is fraud and what is called a ""bait and switch"" tactic. Since PF Chang's has such little regard for the law, educating their management on the law, or any respect for customer retention, I will be contacting the State Attorney General's office to let them know about this flagrant violation of the law.

I wanted to get a drink, but..after not being able to eat yet, i didn't think that would be wise. Anyways, the service is always very friendly, very quick, and very attentive. I've never had an issue. I've never even had to wait a long time to be seated! I guess that's the bonus of coming during the weekdays. There is even a rewards program now..love those rewards programs. I felt so bad today, because I had to be on the phone to make some pretty important calls that i've been behind on due to lack time in my schedule right now..i don't usually like to be on the phone while at restaurants..i was on hold for 15 mins with one call..and they were still super nice. But still..so sorry for having to be on the phone. They even gave me a refill of my soda to go without me having to request one! They totally read my mind about me having a soda obsession..good thing i had just come from the dentist lol.

Was just informed by the manager of this location that on Saturdays after the hours of 4:00pm, the reservation policies on large parties suddenly changes (as does the size of the restaurant apparently).Any parties larger than 4 cannot make a reservation after 4:00pm or before 8:00pm due to the size of their establishment, BUT the restaurant is magically big enough to host a party of 7 (all adults over 27) any time before 4:00pm and after 8:00pm. She also informed us that if we showed up without a reservation between those hours that we would not be turned away, BUT we would be required to wait 2 to 3 hours before being seated. She also said this applied to any parties bigger than 4 people.Lucky for us though, she told us we could go to the Irvine location because the policy and size of the restaurant do not magically change on Saturdays between those hours.

To the credit of PF Chang's it was delivered by Door Dash, but the food was correct temperatures and everything seemed to be as it would have been should I have picked it up myself. First, I tried the wok vegetable sushi...HORRIBLE! The seaweed was chewy, but worst off, the ""vegetables"" were literally iceburg lettuce and roasted red bell peppers. Then there was the Mandarin Crunch Salad with they forgot to include the dressing. But, I don't even think that would have helped. The mango was really mushy and bad. The entire thing almost smelled fishy and some of the lettuce was translucent, like it had gone bad or been frozen at some point. The chicken lettuce cups and chow mein were fine, thank goodness because the other 2 dishes weren't even edible.Lastly, I was excited to get to the fortune cookies and even those were ruined by the establishment. Instead of anything fortuitous or silly, they were facts about PF Changs. I mean c'mon...cant a person even enjoy the free cookie without being harassed by an advertisement?

The ambiance, the view of the ocean, the prompt friendly service welcomed the diner. I'd gone there for many years but hadn't been back in maybe 2 years. I picked up a friend from the airport and suggested  we go there for lunch. Won Ton soup sounded so good to me. We were seated promptly but that was the last of the word prompt. The restaurant wasn't especially crowded.  There was only 1 woman sitting at the bar and the tables were less than half full. Our woman server came over for our drink order. I ordered water and my friend ordered a glass of wine. The water was served minus the wine and our server said it would be over shortly. About 15 mins later it arrived. We told our server we were hungry and would like to place our order. We did I ordered the soup that I came for and my friend ordered lo mein noodles and Kung Pao chicken. Pretty close to 30mins later our food arrived. Here is the biggest disappointment. To repeat I have only had delicious flavored food at this restaurant. The wonton soup had no flavor and it was sparse with broth that was warm but not hot. The chicken in the soup was not poached but dry as leather as if it had been boiled for hours. I ate some of my friends noodles. NO FLAVOR in the Kung Pao chicken dry dry like the chicken in my soup. All the years I'd gone to Chang's they had a trio of sauces on the table. A chili sauce, a hot mustard and another sauce similar to soy sauce. There was a soy sauce on the table. Our server was no where in sight nor returning to our table so I found her standing at the bar. I asked her for the sauces and she said she'd bring them. Went back to my table. She stayed standing at the bar and then went over to a table to take an order. I finally got up walked over to her again and said let me follow you to get the sauces you don't have to bring them to me. She hastily said I'll bring them and she did. At that point another man server came over and said he'd be our server. We only needed a check and we certainly weren't demanding in any way of the previous server. Here's the bottom line. We will never go back to this location. When a person likes a restaurant and perhaps the chef changes or new ownership takes over this can happen. I don't know the reason for all of the food to be tasteless but do not want to experience it again. The poor service can very occasionally happen but pair it with unappetizing food and not a good combination. I will make an effort to visit another P.F. Chang's at another location for comparison.",92660

Slight bummer for me, because I'm someone who can't eat a lot of carbs. Sashimi here was refreshing, delicious, and was great at any time of the day.I wish they'd reconsider their menu and revert back. Same old options for one flavor poke and simple sushi rolls...

There should be about $15 on the gift card.On my birthday visit, we asked the waitress to use the remaining balance and charge the leftover on a new card. He came back and said there is no balance on the old card (there should be $15). The same old story happened again, Fraud of gift card! But I did not expect it at a prestigious restaurant.Anyways, he said he needs to share with manager. Manager showed up (a lady) and asked us to give the receipt from last time that clearly showed that there must be some remaining $. She came back after a couple of minutes and said it takes time to check and if we want to wait. I agreed to wait. She came back again and said sorry I dropped your receipt from last time in trash and I cannot find it.!! so the only evidence that there was a fraud was destroyed. Then she said since you are waiting here for a while (almost 30 minutes by now) we pay you that amount that you think it was reduced from your card as if it was our fault and she was doing us a favor. She paid us and then I insisted that I wanted the receipt back. She brought a huge trash bag to the middle of restaurant. It was full and she made us look for the receipt in there. I stick my hand all the way to the elbow into it to find the receipt (evidence). All of the sudden all customers started to notice, and then she went to her office and came back immediately with receipt. She said sorry I was wrong.

I brought a group of seniors in for dinner (they can be a tough crowd to please). We called ahead and reserved a table. Best table in the place, IMO. The waiter couldn't have been nicer along with being very patient. The food was great. Truly a wonderful dinner outing with ""no"" complaints from the group. I can't remember the last time that happened (we go out twice a month). Thanks to the team for a great dining experience.",92660

I ordered the Mongolian beef and the chefs at this location ONLY have come up with a secret sauce blend if you're into spicy food. It was the BEST dish I have had. It was the perfect amount of kick to satisfy my taste buds. It is worthy of the drive just to eat this dish. We will be back!,92660

We went to this PFChang and was very disappointed at the change. They had remodeled the restaurant, it looked modern and cozy. I used to love their Mai tai served in a beautiful crystal bowl like glass, it was colorful and tasted heavenly at $5, it is now $6, yellow looking drink from some canned fruit juice mix? I could not drink it so i asked for some grenadine to make it drinkable. I then ordered a margarita as I was frustrated with the Mai Tai, the margarita came in a small glass and it was $7 instead of $5 when it was in a tall glass not that long ago.We ordered the happy hour menu items, the chicken lettuce wraps were just as delicious as we remembered it as a 5 stars item, the salt & pepper calamari was ok but it was not authentic, the chicken satay was nicely grilled but THE SAUCE WAS A JOKE! it was supposed to be peanuts but where were the nuts? I did not taste any, it was watery and tasteless.We ordered from the menu Singapore friend noodles, we just got back from Singapore and this was no Singapore noodles, it must have curry, a flaming taste from the wok, what came out was soggy vermicelli drenched in very sweet tomatoey sauce and at $12.50, it was pricey. I should have sent it back.What happened? did they have new owners, I like PF Chang and will try the one in LA and Vegas to see if I can have the same experience I had years ago.",92660

The P.F. in Mission Viejo is wayyyy better. The chefs obviously don't follow the same recipe. The hot and sour soup was neither hot nor sour. It was like bathwater flavor. The Sheshuan beef tastes gamey and dare I say peculiarly not at all like beef. Makes me wonder what the he'll animal I just consumed earlier tonight. The garlic noodles were dry. I asked for garlic noodle not crispy noodle. Seriously! And then there was the eggplant dish which by default was better than the rest which tastes like boiled gymsocks. And all of this was take out I picked up and my boyfriend ended up with diarrhea! I was happy today at work and then at a doctor's visit and thought I'd celebrate with P.F. Chang Newport - big mistake. Last time I visit that location.,92660

Last night was the first time I sat at the bar for dinner as the wait for a table was longer than we could wait to eat.  It is fairly typical for at least a 20 minute wait. They are pretty busy. My friend and I split the tofu lettuce wraps and the vegetable Lo Mein. Both were excellent. Service was really good and our orders came quickly.   My favorite dish is the garlic noodles and my friend's favorite is the pan-fried noodles, we agreed to share those next time. Restroom was clean when I went in to was my hands before eating. Again, sat at the bar. Tried something new: Coconut Curry Vegetables. It was excellent.

134,"1145 Newport Center Dr Newport Beach, CA 92660",Camber H.,"Long Beach, CA",7/5/2018,1,"I've never walked out of a restaurant before July 4, 2018! My boyfriend and I were heading home and decided to dine at P.F.Changs in Fashion Island because I had a hankering for the veggie wrap and spicy noodles. We landed in the tiny lobby (seats 4-6 tiny people if you don't breath) at 5:30 PM and were told there would be about a 5-minute wait. 10 minutes later the hostess apologized for the wait which we didn't even mind as she took us to a tiny corner table which my boyfriend thought was kind of claustrophobic, but nonetheless, it was a holiday and we were happy to get seated. We weren't able to sit right away because a waiter who was taken a family's order was blocking our one of two ways to squeeze into this corner so we waited...... and when he wasn't going to notice us three standing on his heels (me, my boyfriend and the hostess) we took option two and slid into our tiny V-shaped area facing the whole view of the restaurant. The hostess again apologized for the timing of delivering us to the table and we simply shook it off. Now it's 5:45. We knew before arriving what we wanted, including wines and were ready to order. The frazzled waiter finished taking the family's order and I expected him to turn to acknowledge us. He didn't. As we sat there my brilliant boyfriend noticed that all the items we both wanted were on the Happy-Hour-Menue which ended at 6:00 PM. It was now 6:49. Now another waiter entered our area and took a difficult gift card payment from our neighbors and I now expected him to acknowledge us, but he quickly walked off to handles closing out their bill. Now I wondered WHO WAS OUR WAITER? As the clock ticked my blood pressure began to rise. Now it was 6:01 and I was worried about getting our order in without being met by resistance due to the time. Every minute seemed like an eternity. I had it! I walked up to the hostess stand and explained we'd been waiting over 15 minutes to be acknowledged to no avail. She was very spry and quickly said ""I'll get the waiter and the manager right away"" We WAITED again. A few minutes later a disheveled waiter showed up and nervously said I'm sorry you waited what may I get you? Since we wanted to check the happy-hour conditions we asked about the differences. He didn't want any more of his time taken and said. Why don't I just get a drink order and then I'll come back. He said it like we were taking up his time and he wasn't going to take it. The mood of this restaurant was not over the top horrible. Note here: I started working in fine dining restaurants at 15 years old and worked my way into managing two downtown Los Angeles restaurant in the 1990s before making upward use of my experience. I'm a compassionate customer. but I'm not a doormat. P.F.Changs in Newport beach treated us with disregard. As we walked out after ordering our Pinot Grigio and my babe ordered a Sangria sort of wine I attempted to catch the nerve recked waiter to stop him from ordering our wines, but of course, he was nowhere in sight. When I told the hostess we were leaving and explained why she just stared at us without concern.  No manager ever tried to correct the situation. Side note. I DO NOT blame the waiter entirely. I think the management system this night was terribly flawed and no one cared enough to fix it at on the front lines or was trained who to properly deal with a BAD SITUATION. I've been a fan of P.F.Changs for about 20 years. Now I am less likely to return.",92660

136,"1145 Newport Center Dr Newport Beach, CA 92660",Deirdre L.,"Costa Mesa, CA",1/3/2017,1,"I ordered delivery from PF Changs tonight through DoorDash. First, let me say that the delivery person was amazing and my review in no way reflects on the great service I got from her or DoorDash tonight. This is a review about the restaurant specifically. I ordered the 'new' Brussels sprout appetizer. It was awful. It was mostly pineapple and sliced red chili peppers. I have attached a picture in which I separate the sprouts from the other ingredients to show you the ratio. Firstly, those two things don't go with Brussel sprouts at all! Secondly, even if they did, if the menu item is titled ""Brussel Sprouts"", that should be the main item in the dish. They weren't even remotely the main item. I also ordered an eggplant entree. You know what I love about eggplants? The actual eggplant! This entree was so smothered in a sweet sauce that I couldn't taste the eggplant at all plus, the eggplant was so over cooked, it was just a bunch of mushy blobs floating in the sauce. (Another picture attached.)I also ordered the chicken fried rice (see picture). There was barely any chicken in it at all!!! I think I counted at most 10 slivers of chicken. Finally, I ordered the Kung Pao Chicken. I have had that several times before. They have clearly changed their ratios. My entree was mostly red chilies (even though I specifically asked for them to limit the number of chilies) and celery. Celery! That's not even listed as an ingredient in the dish on the menu. So, I think that this location has benefited from being in FI and has gotten lazy in their quality control. I won't be ordering from them again. (I tried to add photos to this review, but couldn't for some reason. I'll add them in the photo section.)",92660

The woman on the phone said the rice doesn't come with those and I proceeded to tell her they had been in my order in the past so I just wanted to confirm. She told me everything that was supposed to come in it and I said okay that's fine just no snap peas please. When my boyfriend went to pick up the order they told him they removed all vegetables from my vegetable fried rice....he called me and told me the situation and I told him that was incorrect. When he brought this to the attention of the women working at the front they were extremely rude to him and told him that's what I asleep for over the phone...then he had to wait an additional 20 minutes for them to correct the order. We were both frustrated by this considering we had an issue with ordering online in the past so we decided to call in to avoid the same problem.

But after this experience today (06/01) I don't think I'll be back to this location again. My sister, my seven year old niece and I came for dinner around 7 o'clock and the food was amazing and our server was very involved with us and split time with other tables evenly so it wasn't like we were going unnoticed. But, towards the end of our meal a table of 4 people awere seated next to us, they were EXTREMELY intoxicated. Yelling at the top of their lungs at each other, laughing, and throwing f-bombs back and fourth. I, along with multiple other people in the restaurant were uncomfortable including my seven year old niece. After leaving the restaurant, we called the manager on duty (around 8 pm) and all she could say is ""Well, I didn't hear anything."" What kind of response is that? I don't care if you heard it or not. It still happened and your servers (WHO DID HEAR THEM) didn't do a single thing. The ONLY THING a manager did was tell the group that they could not place a table in the walk way because it was not clear and they continued to yell while that manager was around.

Timing was fine. Food delivery was excellent (thank you Jacqueline G.), but what I was VERY disappointed in was PF Chang's delivery portion sizes. I spent $69.41 (not including tip) for one small appetizer (4 pork dumplings), two teeny tiny entrees (Mongolian Beef and Kung Pao Shrimp), and one rather sad looking dessert (Banana Spring Rolls). While you expect delivery food to be lukewarm with a diminished presentation, I certainly did NOT anticipate the portion sizes to be so dramatically reduced from what you get at the restaurant. The Mongolian Beef had maybe nine small pieces of beef? At nearly $20.00, it was a truly a rip off. Let's just say, while I anticipated leftovers based on what I ordered (we weren't terribly hungry), I was happy that we BARELY enough food for the evening. Barely.",92660

Our server was awesome. He damn well made sure my water was ALWAYS full & he wasn't the obnoxious type that comes by every 3 minutes checking up on us. He was great. Also be sure to get a window seat - the view is lovely! The portions are HUGE. & for only $9 I got a lot of food!!! It was a bargain. Man was that rice great. So many flavors: onion, hints of egg, chicken, just yum.PS: Not sure why this restaurant is labeled as GF, as you have to ask the server which items contain Gluten, which is really annoying. They are NOT labeled so good luck with that.",92660

It was my Mom's 70th birthday and we decided to make the drive from Corona to Newport in order to accommodate my daughter who is going to UCI.  Unfortunately, we did not make reservations so we decided to call the restaurant while in route, which we were informed we could not do call ahead seating but there was not a wait for a party of 6.We arrived at the restaurant 10-15 minutes after the call only to be informed we would now have an 1 - 1 1/2 hour wait .... WHHAATTT???  As one of the hostess went for the manager the other tried to figure out a way we could be seated together. SIDE NOTE: we found out this PF Changs is one of the smallest and does not accommodate multiple larger parties.When James the manager came over I explained to him our dilemma, long drive and Mom Birthday.  He immediately jumped into action, walked me around and saw an opportunity to seat us at the table next to the kitchen after make a couple of re-arrangements. James was very apologetic and helpful.Our waiter Joe showed up and immediately greeted and welcomed us to the back by the kitchen, unaware of what it took just to get this table. Joe was just a friendly and attentive waiter who made our entire dining experience fun and full of laughter. By the end of the night, he was giving Birthday hugs to my Mom as we felt like he could have joined us at the table as one of the family. I am grateful for the little extra time James took to ensure we did not have to wait or leave to find somewhere else that could accommodate us. My Mom had a wonderful time and it really had nothing to do with the quality, quantity or taste of food.  Although, the food was great which made it that much better.

We had a party of 6. I went inside the lobby to get a table, behind an older gentleman who was probably in his late 60s who appeared to be a delivery guy from Door dash. He said his name was Clifford. He asked to pick up his order and the girl who helped him said he needed to leave. He said he had 2 orders he was picking up for door dash. We watched closer because he hadn't done anything wrong and the girl was really rude and started screaming at him. So then a short, stalky lady who said she was a general manager then added to the screaming and threatened to call the police. Everyone is watching them. Me and my sister said maybe we should eat somewhere else because this was really uncomfortable and we wanted to relax and eat at a nice restaurant. The 2 women who worked there kept insisting that he leave. And the manager was getting irate. We then decided we didn't want to eat at P.F. Chang's that night because although we have eaten there before and the food is good and the service is usually great, What we witnessed was not nice. Why should a manager treat a guy who's just trying to deliver food to people get screamed at, on a holiday? He eventually left and that's really sad. Maybe the 2 people who ordered their food never got their food because the delivery guy was told to leave. I order from Postmates and Door dash sometimes Uber eats and that service is really nice.",92660

I don't wanna go too much into a bad memory but the last PF Chang's I've been to 5 years ago was in Torrance when it first opened for a Holiday Dinner with friends. The service was horrible to the point where I boycott ALL PF Chang's for the past 5 years. I refused to go to ANY PF Chang's with any friends or family members so trust me when I say, I can hold a grudge. Anyway, came here for Happy Hour with my gf and I must say, it's pretty awesome here. Their happy hour is everywhere in the restaurant from 3-6pm, so you don't have to just sit at the bar. Our waitress was impeccable. She was sweet, attentive and funny. She recommended awesome drinks and appetizers! Fried green beans - 5 stars! Now this is what I'm talking about. Lightly battered and fried but green beans are still fresh and have a slight crunch. Spicy aioli dipping sauce was magical! Chicken lettuce wraps - 5 stars! Huge portion with good size lettuce cups. Good flavor to the chicken :)Chicken flatbread - 0 star. This dish was incredibly disappointing. It's PF Chang's take on a quesadilla I guess but it was so wrong. It was too dry and hard, with zero flavor. Asian pear mojito - 4 stars. I normally don't like mojitos (it's something about the mint leaves that bugs me) but this one is pretty good. It's more light and freshing and more sweet than most I've tried. Can't taste the pear but oh well. Maybe I'll start going to more PF Chang's...maybe. I still hate the location in Torrance though, hate hate hate!",92660

Maybe it's because I grew up with half of my family cooking authentic Chinese food that wasn't drowned in sodium and artificial flavors, but it blows my mind this food is actually appetizing to some people.Food: 1 star (maybe even 0)The food is so God-awful I can't even begin to describe it. If you have ever had legitimate Chinese food, it tastes nothing like this ""fusion"" crap they bring to you. Started with their edamame and that was over-salted. Had the hot and sour soup and tasted nothing like actual hot and sour soup. Just like a lot of beef bullion with some tofu in it. I had the Mongolian beef for lunch with fried rice and these were both pretty bad. It tasted like a lot of salty sauce with over cooked beef. Service: 4 starsGood service from Jackson, our waiter.

That's all PF Changs is. It's almost comical how overpriced it is for what you get.    A buddy, who is vegetarian, ordered the steamed vegetables w/ rice. We were almost laughing at what was brought to the table. It resembled the precut vegetables in a bag that you could find at your grocery store. No seasoning, salt, pepper, or even sauce. Just some frozen vegetables that were brought back to life by heating them.     I ordered the Mongolian Beef. I can't say it was bad, but I've had the same thing at Pei Wei and it was the same quality at half the price.      We already had our pre conceived notion at what we were getting into prior to going, but PF Changs just lived up to that.

Decided to stop by P.F. Chang's for their happy hour, mostly because I was lured in by their unusually extensive menu. Ordered: -Pork steamed dumpling: mediocre. For $3.25, you get 3 dumplings, which was NOT worth the price at all. You can go to a dimsum place with legit dimsum and you'll usually get 4 pieces for less than $3.25... The skin was rather thick and overly chewy (aka didn't taste fresh at all). -Shrimp steamed dumpling: Same conclusion as above, except it was $4 for 3 dumplings (... I'm at happy hour, right?!)-Flaming red wontons: Guessing this is a rather Americanized twist on Szechuan wontons. Obviously not as authentic, but the flavors were strong, which I enjoyed. Again, I had an issue with the pricing ($5 for 6 wontons). I can go to A&J's and get delicious ""red wontons"" at normal hours and get the same amount of wontons for the fraction of the price... -Chang's chicken lettuce wraps: This was probably one of very few items that seemed to be worth the money - decent sized portion at $6, and the waiter happily gave us more lettuce when we ran out. Chicken was a bit dry and over salty, but it was decent.-Dynamite shrimp: Disappointing. $7 for a few pieces of shrimp that was over-battered and pathetically small. Sauce was overbearingly creamy and didn't have the kick I expected from a dish called ""dynamite shrimp""-Ahi crisp: Didn't even try because didn't look appetizing.I normally never complain about prices. I've dished out ~$300 for one meal before, and spent about $70 for three at happy hour at another location. But if the quality is going to be this bad, the prices need to go way down. Also, food was overly salty. Blegh. Won't be back for happy hour.",92660

The wontons were crispy, not greasy, and the dipping sauce was just right to add a little sweet tang to the crab and cream cheese filling. They were light, delicious and would make a nice start to any meal.Now, I'm drooling thinking about the Tuna Tataki. They are small, delicate, just barely seared on the outside and sliced thin with a paper thin slice of toasted garlic and jalapeno on top. Wonderful. I love rare or raw tuna if it is of decent quality, which this was. The surprise on the plate was the chilled seaweed salad, with simple dressing, I ate it alone between bites or piled some on top of the tuna and ate is as a combo.Either way I'd order that every time I go.The chicken noodle soup was a surprise. It's made fresh to order but the surprise was that it came in a little white tureen!....I thought, ""This is enough soup for four people. What have I done?"" Luckily, the bartender offered to put any I couldn't finish into a container so I ate a couple of bowls and let him make the rest to go. I had the soup for dinner and I love the tender strips of chicken meat, the shitake mushrooms, the thick noodles (rice noodles, I believe) the broth was very mild and the grape tomatoes are a nice, sweet addition. I added more hot sauce to my liking, but it is good soup already for folks who are not into the heat like I am.",92660

Get the egg drop! 2) One appetizer- of course u need to order their famous chicken lettuce wraps3) 2 entreees: we had the Mongolian Beef  (very tender) & the crispy honey shrimp  (was ok)4) dessert we upgraded to a full size dessert for $4.25 more and got the Banana Spring rolls that came with coconut pineapple ice cream.

They remodeled their location in Newport Beach, located in Fashion Island about a year ago or so and it is very impressive. Beautiful layout, the staff is very accommodating, professional and pleasant. Honestly, any time somebody asks me where to go for lunch/dinner in Newport Beach, especially friends from out of town or friends that are visiting here from a different country, I always refer them to P.F. Chang's in Newport Beach, since I know that the food is going to be excellent as well as the service and not to mention the beautiful sunset views!! They have a fairly large bar area as well, which is great if you just want to stop by and have a quick lunch. Bartenders are always very friendly and efficient.Last time I went there, they had an extra summer menu, with some light and flavorful options. Even if you have a favorite dish that you like, I would try out one of the options on this menu. My friends that I had dinner with ordered from it and were very pleased they did!!You can order take out online via their website:  pfchangs.comI use it all the time for my ""To Go"" orders and it is very user friendly.

Wonton soup made from real boiled chicken bones--love this stuff especially when dealing with a cold. There is seafood in it, so those with allergies-- beware. Service for me always spot ON. Drinks perfectly chilled glasses and not too pricey for premiums. Wait time, not too bad on a Saturday 6 pm-- 1 H 30 min quote-- seated in 45 minutes for a party of 6. Amazing if you ask me.

The food has always been made consistently and pretty decent. The lunch specials are always such a good deal and perfect portions for me. Just enough for me to feel satisfied and be able to finish my food. You get rice, an entree & soup. My fave to get so far is their Crispy Honey Shrimp, & Kung Pao Chicken. The Crispy Green Beans starter is a must! Sometimes I come here just for this. The string beans are battered and deep fried and come with this dipping sauce that has a bit of a kick that is just amazing![-1 Star] I only wish that the kitchen sped up the delivery of the food.

All the dishes we had paralleled their traditional Chinese dish namesake but some with a slightly more fusion-take. Their lettuce wraps were a crowd favorite, but wish they provided more lettuce leafs. Their salt & pepper calamari was also crispy without being coated in thick batter.  The singapore noodles and kung pao chicken were standard.Overall, not a bad place to go if you are craving Chinese food while in the mall.",92660

During lunch time, we sat at a table and ordered Mushu Chicken which was on their lunch special for about $10, chicken lettuce wraps, and Shrimp in Lobster Sauce along with Fried banana spring rolls for dessert. At first I didn't think I'd like anything here because I know its not authentic chinese food, BUT I really did enjoy my experience here. I loved the service and the food as well. The chicken lettuce wraps had a smokey, BBQ taste to it and the Mushu chicken came with tortillas so you could make little burritos. Both were delicious. My shrimp in lobster sauce on the other hand was kind of gross... I should have known there weren't going to be any lobster sauce in it and I was really disappointed in the dish. I thought it was too goopy (kinda like they used too much corn starch) and it wasn't very flavorful. I had to force myself to eat half of that. We were super stuffed by the end of our meal, but really wanted dessert, plus we also had a 30% off coupon from their red envelope give away during Chinese New Years. We ordered the fried banana spring rolls which had coconut & pineapple ice cream with caramel drizzled on top and 3 fried bananas with some fresh strawberries, blueberries and raspberries. SOOOO GOOD. I keep dreaming about this dessert and came back the second time SPECIFICALLY just for it! love love love it!

Party of 6 and I alone stood in front of our table, in the middle of a very busy walkway next to the kitchen, for a good 5 minutes before a manager finally brought me a chair. Ordered our drinks, waited about 15 minutes for them. Ordered all our food, including apps, all at once. Apps were out within 5 minutes! Food started coming out for half our table right after. Still no kids juice though. Waited 35 minutes between the first orders coming out, and mine and the second kids meal being served. Half our table was done and ready to go by the time our food came. Problem was, we weren't getting our rice. We kept being told it was coming, but we asked 3 times and waited 15 more minutes for rice! Trying to get refills, have orders fixed, etc, was such a nightmare. Our table was in the worst possible spot and servers were constantly brushing past us left and right. It was just a terribly stressful experience. My food was good, but I was unhappy with the portion. It was the same size as the smaller lunch portion at the Long Beach location.

Despite the fact that Scott and I are totally on a dining out budget (because we're food addicts and our addiction can get quite expensive) we decided to go on a date night at P.F. Chang's (courtesy of Scott's awesome birthday gift card from his boss) last night!WE HAD A BLAST!!!Our reservation was for 7pm but since we arrived around 6, we were able to take advantage of the happy hour at the sushi bar. As soon as we were seated, we immediately noticed our sushi chef--chef Julio slicing sashimi and avocado in the most skilled way we've ever seen. Just based on watching chef Julio work, it made us feign for sushi (even though we went out for Chinese food). So amongst the chicken lettuce wraps and fried calamari, Scott and I also decided to order a few tuna nigiris from the sushi bar. Chef Julio introduced himself to us when he made our nigiris and suggested that we also try out the Salmon. The quality of the fish was superb but what was even better was learning about sushi with chef Julio. Because the company of chef Julio was so enjoyable, we actually ended up sitting at the sushi bar all night!Overall, we had a 5 star experience and can't wait to come back to P.F.

I can't tell you how many times I am left sitting waiting for a server to come by because something was incorrect on my order. Miranda kept our drinks filled (we drank a lot of water/tea!), she checked on our appetizer and meal immediately after they were brought out.This place was packed tonight, but the wait was maybe 10mins? All and all very pleased with the place, I will be back!",92660

The fact that this one has both is fantastic.  We go A Lot! The host went out of his way to get us seated at one of the high top tonight. People never realize these are first come seating. We rarely wait for a seat even when there's 4 of us. Service is always great. Noland took care of us tonight. Great service.  Highly recommended this PF Changs.",92660

This was pretty much the last straw. So insanely over salted beef and broccoli and extremely bland low mein and combo rice. I never thought I would say this but Panda Express is probably better at this point. This used to be one of our favorite places but we will not be back to this location.

Our server Bennet was very accommodating and was on point with recommendations. He was very personable, efficient, and went above and beyond to take care of us.

Great job outsourcing your online ordering system! I USED to order from Chang's at least once a week because it was close to my office (the Irvine Spectrum location), and I need gluten-free options. I say ""used to"" because repeatedly the online ordering system would say 50 minutes to get my order...no matter what time of day I ordered...1130am...1pm...even 2pm. Then I would go to the restaurant and sit and wait for 15 minutes AFTER the time my order was supposed to be ready...and the restaurant would be half empty! After speaking with the manager (and for the 2nd time having my food taste like soap...), he told me to call the restaurant directly because the call center they had outsourced to would always give lengthy order times. Tried the Fashion Island location this evening. Same issue. It's almost 8pm on a WEDNESDAY and online says 45 minutes. I call the website number for the restaurant and it transfers me to the call center. They say 45-50 minutes. Really? At 8pm on a Wednesday night??? So I ask to be transferred to the restaurant itself. 25 minutes. 25 MINUTES!! From 45-50!! Yep. That's consistency! How many people have said ""screw it"" when the online ordering system told them it would be almost an hour to get their food? No wonder the restaurants are half empty these days...You have lost what was probably your most loyal customer (because I used to order from you at least once a week when I lived in Phoenix as well since you are the only gluten-free Chinese food available, and I actually really enjoyed your food). I have 2 gift cards to use up and once those are gone will never frequent a Pf Chang's again until there is reassurance they have addressed their system...not that they really give a rat's butt, since I have tried contacting their corporate office twice and have yet to receive a response (despite the manager at Irvine Spectrum saying it is their biggest complaint and that he hears it all the time...).Good luck to you.",92660

Very smiley, attentive, fun and funny! All the staff was friendly and fun. We sat at the sushi bar and were spared a 45 minute Friday night wait! We ordered off the meals for two and it was delicious. We had sweet and sour soup, lettuce wraps, Mongolian beef, dandan noodles and the salted caramel cake. Sooooooo amazing.

I place an order of orange chicken, Changs spicy chicken, eggrolls with brown rice and white rice. Food got ready in a reasonable time, so I then want home. Once I got home I noticed that they had forgot the rice. I obviously wasn't too happy I wanted to enjoy a full meal, so I decided to call them and ask that they have some rice ready and I was going to swing by and pick it up because I live fairly close. On my drive over there my wife called and said that they had also forgotten the Egg-rolls. So they had literally forgot half my meal, I felt that this was reasonable enough to call the manager and voice my concern. Now that I had to drive back to the restaurant, my food was going to be cold and my whole meal just got ruined. I was able to speak to the manager for brief moments and he indicated that he would have the rice ready. When I got there I informed him that the eggrolls were missing as well. He then hurried back to the kitchen to get my Eggrolls. Then the server that originally helped me handed me a card for $15 credit mind you the whole meal cost about $45. I was severely disappointed because my meal got  ruined everything was cold by time I got home and nobody took the time to walk up to me and just say we apologize and we are correcting the issue. I feel like this issue could've been easily avoided if whoever was serving my food would've done a final check before presenting it to me.  I sincerely doubt that my wife and I were returning to this location, and I will be recommending to my office to consider other restaurants for catering services. Not because the food was bad but because I  did not feel like I was treated with respect.",92660

I indicated that I had not changed the res and they said sorry they had us confused with someone else (no mention of the birthday).  The four of us ordered two of the special dinners for two $39.  The chicken  wrap was good but that is where the good food stopped.  The chicken dishes we ordered were dry and not edible the pork was tough.  The shrimp was OK. We ate very little of the chicken dishes and mentioned the fact that the were so dry that they weren't edible but there was no attempt to adjust the bill.  The waiter was totally unaware that this was a birthday celebration (bad communication).  In his defense our waiter was very good.The best part is that the entire restaurant is under construction.  The floors are uneven and bare, the walls are bare and the best part is that the bathrooms were also under construction and the hostess had to make sure the bathroom was clear because they were using one bathroom for both men and women.

I wish I remembered my servers name because he was amazing! Super attentive and very friendly. Also he was very knowledgeable about the whole menu and had great suggestions for everything.

Sat down, no menus, had to go back to the hostess after a few minutes to request menus. Now it's about a few minutes after 5, no server to be found. The restaurant is about 40-50% full. It's pushing 10 after 5pm and no service has been offered yet. Miraculously at 5:15 a server has presented himself. Asked him about a few dishes and he was not too interested in promoting the dishes very well, let alone his description made me not want to try the dishes, ever. 5:25 - first course of orange ginger edamame arrive at the table. Flavor is meh and not ""wok"" prepared as described by the server. 5:45 - entrees were brought to the table. FOOD WAS AMAZING. Kung pao shrimp and Buddhas feast. All had wonderful flavor and cooked to perfection. By 6:15 we were all closed out and ready to leave. Good thing we weren't in a hurry after expecting to go to a quick dinner at a half empty restaurant on a Tuesday night.  We were not the only party in the restaurant that had issues with the service, or lack there of. Another disgruntled party of two (note: sitting at a real dining table not the ""bar table"")was flagging down a member of the wait staff as if he were signaling for SOS while stuck on a deserted island.

I've been to this PF Changs probably about 100 times as I work and live down the street. But tonight stands out above any other time by a long shot. We had no reservations and there was about an hour wait so we chose to sit at the sushi bar. What a treat if you get the chance. Nick (sushi ninja) stopped what he was doing to greet us and explain about the sushi and menu and made us feel welcome.Then Alex ( best server in the world) came and explained all about the menu, recommendations and went into explicit detail about the sushi menu. When we ordered I asked for my orange chicken in a specific way in which they don't offer on the menu. He took my order down to the last detail and said he would make it happen. ( back to this in a minute)We also ordered sushi. And we had the privilege of watching Nick the sushi ninja ( yes I made that up because he in an artist with fish) make our sushi while talking with us about his history with the company and his history with sushi. It's rare to find staff that will actually carry a conversation with you and not make you feel like they are just going along with it because it's their job. What a treat to be able to watch it in front of our eyes and the sushi was amazing. Best salmon I have ever had!Back to Alex.... I got my special order orange chicken..... And it was literally the BEST orange chicken I have had anywhere. Far better than any orange chicken I have had at PF Changs or anywhere for that matter. All because Alex took the time to make sure my order was perfect. And we aren't talking about a slow afternoon, we're talking about a packed house on a Saturday night with an hour wait time and this guy takes the time to make sure I got exactly what I ordered. Unbelievable. And on top of that he truly seemed genuine when he checked to see how I liked it. I thanked him for taking the time to make sure it was perfect and I believe his exact words were "" food is important and  is supposed to be a simple pleasure away from your busy life"" all I could think is wow, this guy actually cares. It is so rare to find a person who puts his whole heart into something and is so genuine, let alone to have the pleasure of having that person as a waiter at a chain restaurant like PFC. A pleasure it was sir. My hat is off to you. This was the best dining experience I have ever had. I wish I could open a restaurant and hire these guys because it would be a gold mine. Yes the food was great but it was the experience that Alex and Nick gave us that made the meal and set the great mood for my girlfriend and I to start our night out after a long work week.Thank you Alex for this great experience and your genuine caring personality, and thank you Nick for the incredible sushi and engaging conversation. I hope management reads this and realizes what they have with these two guys, Alex especially. This guy should be the GM. If you go to this restaurant, ask for Alex, he will make your night. And for the record I believe he said his days off are Sunday, Monday and tues afternoon, so avoid those times and save your money till he's there. You'll thank me, and him for it. If you made it this far into the novel, thank you one last time Alex and Nick. My girlfriend and I will be back to enjoy your company once again!",92660

The seating is great, especially if you can snag a table by the window, but it can be a little tight (they're guilty of the same thing many restaurants are -- cramming more tables in a space than they should).Food was always good, service was sometimes spotty, but being with friends and family in a nice place made it allll good.",92660

The views are GORGEOUS.  I wish I could have stayed to eat at the bar or something!  When we finally opened the food, it was fresh hot and delicious.  We had the spring rolls, almond & cashew chicken, veggie fried rice, & cocounut curry vegetables.  My favorite of everything we had was the coconut curry vegetables!!! The flavors were like a FLAVOR EXPLOSION!!!  Sweet, creamy, salty, savory... All around good stuff.  I think the way the fry the tofu first and then add to the curry really gives the dish a lot more in terms of depth of flavor.  The other dishes were excellent as well but I would probably not order the almond & cashew chicken again since it wasn't bad, but it wasn't great... All in all, the service is wonderful and they are definitely able to cater to large groups.Pros:-Fantastic Service-Great Views-If you pick the right dish, then welcome to flavor townCons:-Fashion Island parking is no joke-PriceyTips:-Try parking in the underground structure by Nordstrom as a last resort.",92660

He had expert knowledge of the food and was able to recommend a noodle dish that was amazing! Hands down probably the best experience I've ever had from a waiter/waitress.

329,"1145 Newport Center Dr Newport Beach, CA 92660",Jay S.,"Fountain Valley, CA",3/4/2013,2,"I would normally give PF in Newport a five star review. My family and I love the food and go here very often. The other night though, everyone of our opinions of this place changed. It started when we called and asked if we could come in a bit before our reservation and get in early. ""Sure, just come in."" Got there forty minutes before our reservation, or so we thought. When we checked in they said we made our reservation for a half hour later, which is ridiculous since they called and confirmed the time earlier in the day. Pretty sure it was busy and they just pushed it back, not ok. We had to wait til after our original reservation time and five minutes before ""their"" reservation time to then be seated at a table that was for six and not seven. So we all squeezed in, not wanting to wait any longer. Our server finally came over ten minutes later. We ordered drinks and our meal all at once. We asked him if he could put all three beefs together on a large plate to save space at the table, since they were the same dishes. He said no we don't do that. Really, because last time we were here our server suggested we do that and it worked out great.Then we had a coupon on our phone that we tried to show him, since last time we came they said they couldn't find it in the system or pull it up and next time to show it at the beginning of the meal. So we try. He wouldn't even look at it. Waved his hand and said, ""I can't do anything with it right now."" We said we understood but could he write down the number? ""No."" That was it, he was gone. Food was, of course, delicious - when it finally arrived. The server came back to inform us that the sea bass was out and to pick something out. Then he came back later to tell us they couldn't make two tofus, just one. Seriously? At least what did come to the table was amazing and delicious, the only reason they get two stars. We were hoping everything would go better from then on, but no way. We ordered dessert and waited forty minutes, 40 MINUTES!! The table right next to us ordered dessert after us, got it, ate it, paid the bill and left by the time we got ours. By this point in time we were so done. We asked for the bill and got it after about ten minutes, no discount from the coupon of course. Showed him the code and what not and he left, only to be gone another 20 minutes. We don't complain and just go with the flow but this was insane. We complained to the manager, who apologized and said he would help move things along - which he did. The server came back with our bill, telling us we can't use the coupon if we do the 2 for $40 meals, something I believe he could of told us in the beginning if he had just LISTENED to what we were saying. I will say that our server was a lot nicer towards the end, but this was the WORST experience we've ever had at a restaurant, especially this one. Every time we've come here before the waiters were SUPER nice and friendly. This guy was rude, unfriendly and unable to smile. We will have to rethink coming here again because when you go somewhere and spend over $200, you would think you could at least get a nice waiter and good customer service. You would think.",92660

332,"1145 Newport Center Dr Newport Beach, CA 92660",Caitlyn O.,"Huntington Beach, CA",5/24/2017,5,"Great Eats!  When you enter the large wooden doors at P.F. Chang's in Fashion Island, you instantly get a whiff of the sweet smell of something cooking. As you look around the vibe is calming, but dim. The soft lighting and the massive tinted windows makes everything seem a bit darker. The shadowy patterned booth cushions are extremely comfortable and match perfectly with the black tables that are sprinkled with opaque white flakes and cleaned so well you could see your reflection. Toward the middle of the restaurant are wooden tables and chairs that mostly seat couples, but there are some bigger tables for families too. As you walk through, in between four booths are three huge bonsai trees that are at least one hundred fifty years old! The whole place is Chinese themed and is casual, but upper scale. Some people are dressed fancier and others are in jeans and a t-shirt. It's a great place for people of all ages and an elegant place to take that certain someone. The service is exceptionally fast and they constantly come and check on their customers to make sure everything is spectacular!  P.F. Chang's started when a son, Philip Chiang, came home to visit his mother and she cooked him dinner. He thought the food was fabulous and wanted to make restaurant, so that is exactly what he did. His mother gave him all her recipes and the first P.F. Chang's was established in Scottsdale, Arizona in 1993. Philip's mother and the chef became good friends and together the two of them created lots of new recipes. The public loved P.F. Chang's a so the son continued to build more. He eventually died, but now the chain is a popular place with lots of locations. There are over two hundred locations in the United States and over fifty five international P.F. Chang's and more are regularly being built! One of their signature dishes is the crispy honey chicken. It is about one pound of cooked and sliced chicken breast, lightly battered in a tangy honey sauce. Finely minced fresh green onions are mixed in and it is all surrounded by delicious white spongy noodles with a hint of garlic on top. Then you have a choice of white or brown rice on the side to bring the dish all together.  Off the appetizers menu is one of my favorite things ever. The chicken lettuce wraps! The chicken is grounded and there's only about a pound, unfortunately. Diced onions, pepper, salt, drained and sliced water chestnuts, and soy sauce are all  mixed with the chicken to make a perfect and delicious combination. Then you take a piece of lettuce from the head they give you and scoop a spoonful of the mixed ingredients into the piece of lettuce. Next, you fold it like a taco and eat it! Suddenly, your mouth will start to melt because it will probably be one of the best things you will ever taste. Well, at least that happens to me. Last, but not least is the chocolate dome. Let's hope you still have room in your stomach because you definitely do not want to miss out in this. As soon as you see the waiter or waitress coming toward you with your dessert plate, your eyes will start to sparkle like a diamond. It is a little plate with one piece of warm rich chocolate cake with fresh strawberries and raspberries on the side. Then the cake is drizzled with a passion fruit caramel sauce that taste like heaven. The way it tastes in undeniable!",92660

Yeah, boring. My friend ordered garlic spinach which had lots of flavor. I felt bad when she said it's hard to get fresh veggies overseas.

341,"1145 Newport Center Dr Newport Beach, CA 92660",Kale R.,"Roseville, CA",4/14/2008,1,"PF Changs.Deep breath.I love Chinese food. Hole in the wall places, especially. But I can dig Panda Express too. So, when the wife said ""Hey, let's try PF Changs"" I was happy to give it a shot.To start with, I ordered an appetizer called ""Salt and Pepper Calamari."" I always order calamari when its available. It's one of my favorite edible creatures. When prepared right, it's tender, flavorful, with its own unique taste. When it's overcooked, it gets chewy. When it's way overcooked, it becomes rubbery and flavorless. That said, I can not begin to imagine what they do to the Calamari at PF Changs, but I wouldn't be surprised if it involved proximity to a nuclear reactor. If you had served to me the PF Changs calamari in a double blind taste test with deep fried rubber bands, I would pick the rubber bands as the fresher calamari every time. For dinner, I had the Mongolian Beef. I friggin love Mongolian Beef. I've never, ever ordered something called Mongolian Beef at a restaurant and disliked it. It's very different, restaurant to restaurant. Some make it sweet, some a little spicy. Some with white onions, some with green. So, let's get to PF Chang's recipe. If I had to guess, it involved brown sugar, green onions, sewer water and beef jerky. Now, it's not uncommon for beef in such a dish to be a little chewy... But this was beyond chewy. It was jaw-achingly leathery, with crunchy edges. That's right, crunchy.The wife had some sort of chicken dish. I'm not sure what, but I tried it. It had just slightly less flavor than white rice, but at least it wasn't nasty.In fact, my overall experience, is that PF Changs managed to provide for me some of the nastiest things I've ever put in my mouth. Slightly less bad than when I accidentally took a swig of brake fluid, while working on my car and reaching for a soda... But definitely worse than the time I got a mouthful of fresh grasshopper on a nature walk.All in all, if you are looking for a nasty sun-dried-tv-dinner style place to eat, PF Changs is perfect for you.The only bright side, is that I did get my money back. And within 30 minutes, my stomach rejected the foul detritus. Sorry for the visual.",92660

346,"1145 Newport Center Dr Newport Beach, CA 92660",Brad K.,"Irvine, CA",12/12/2006,4,"As far as Americanized-Chinese food chains go PF Chang's is woefully overrated.  It appears they've spent a lot of money and investing on locations and interior design, too bad they didn't spend as much money on hiring excellent chef's.  While PF Chang's in general has done well and much better in other areas of the nation, the two i've been at in the OC were pretty bad.  The food itself was quite pricey considering what I was ordering, and the taste was pretty bland as i found myself trying to add some sort of flavor by bombarding the dishes with chili oil, and red pepper.  I guess if you start turning your food red it will have some sort of taste.  If you're going to eat there I recommend ordering mainstream typically ordered dishes. The ambience of the place was well done.  There were a lot of nice private booths and tables where a date could be carefully performed, just don't take someone there that knows Chinese food or you might not get that call back.*Tip:  stick with mainstream dishes - that way they can't screw up too bad.  The Cheesecake Factory is right next door and they have some asian dishes that are superb - i'd recommend blowing your cash there instead.**EDITAfter a long time having not been there, I ended up going there again a bit later at night around 8:00 for some late night eating.  We ordered two dishes, the Shrimp with Lobster Sauce, and the Hot Fish.  The menu said that the Hot Fish was deep fried so i asked the waiter if they could sautee the fish as that would taste much better.  She said that they could ""starch"" (dusting the filet in flour and stir frying it) it slightly so i went with that.  When the food arrived (fairly quickly) i was pleasantly surprised!  Considering the last time i ate there, this was superb!  The Hot Fish melted in my mouth and was made in a garlic and black bean sauce with snow pods, sliced carrots and celery.  It tasted very similiar to the Fish Filet in Black Bean sauce that i get at Sam Woo's only it was made in primarily a red garlic sauce.  It was delicious!  The Shrimp in Lobster sauce was also very good.  They didn't skimp on the shrimp, and there was a good balance of garlic in there, not too overpowering, but just enough for the flavor to come through.  The waiter gave us plenty of refills on white rice (free) and the service was excellent.  I guess i will have to come back again and will most likely order my customized menu item - i need to see if this was just a fluke or if they have actually gotten better, way better.  For now, i'll upgrade this to 4 stars - the service was excellent, and the food while a bit overpriced - WELL worth it.*TIP!  Shrimp with Lobster Sauce, and Hot Fish (ask for the fish not deep fried) and you can't go wrong!",92660

Next we have the Orange Peel Beef and Szechuan (I know I spelled it wrong, but don't care) Beef. Both were very tasty and the latter was a great suggestion by the waitress. In the midst of this, my clumsy self knocks my amazing Manhattan over. Almost immediately the waitress had it cleaned up (discreetly so I didn't look too dumb) and had another drink in my hand.

The wait was 45 minutes on a Sat. night. We ordered the salt & pepper calamari which was very chewy. We then ordered the sweet & sour pork, Sichuan-style asparagus & Cantonese chow fun with chicken. My daughter had the kid's chicken fried rice. All of it must have been cooked in the same wok because it all tasted like soy sauce and not much else. The sweet & sour pork was overcooked into dry salty nuggets with salty sauce. Everything was salty with little flavor. The chow fun was the exception as it was overpowered by ginger as well. In fact, I ended up biting into a huge chunk of ginger which was very unpleasant. The asparagus was salty -- and yes, even my daughter's kid's fried rice was salty. I'm not super-sensitive to seasoning but this was beyond ridiculous. The server was very friendly and had no problem comping us for the bad food. In fact I would say he did it almost too easily as if he had heard the same complaint many times before.

It's really hard going out to eat, it's hard enough that my girlfriend has to suffer and not go the places she wants cause I can't eat there, but honestly, I am so thankful for P F Changs providing great options for people living on a gluten free diet. Our service was awesome. I don't remember the guys name but once I ordered Red Bridge(gluten free beer) he asked right away if I wanted everything gluten free. Atmosphere was great, somewhat romantic. Food was amazing. My girlfriend and I couldn't stop talking about it and wished we double ordered so we could have some for a midnight snack and breakfast.

I wanted to get a take out order last Sunday, which was Father's Day. I am driving in my car and the to go line just keeps ringing for about 5 minutes. Finally a man answers and is very nice but really laid back and slow talking. He might have been stoned? Anyway. Got there and paid for my order and time goes by. I was told 5:05 at the latest. Easy order for them. 2 Mongolian beef and fried rice. Well the restaurant is not very crowded, maybe a bit over half full. I have had the bad luck to get behind several other to go orders and it takes close to an hour before mine is handed to me. They gave me a pork dumpling appetiser as a sorry gift. All that is about par for many places these days but when I got home the actual beef was so tough, it was almost like a prank. They use cheap skirt steak and I assume they marinate it for some time to tenderize and flavor it. I have had tough meat before with this dish, but never like this. Neither me nor my wife could chew, or wanted to chew this rediculous entree. I am done with this store at Fashion Island. Maybe the kitchen ran out of the marinated beef and ran with whatever they could grab.Genral managers take note. You need to taste what you sell every once in a while to prevent loosing long time customers, like me and my wife. Pei-weis down the street is far better and has the same parent company.

(UGGH) I am a slower eater, and had no sign of being full, and she started to take stuff off the table, making me so upset I was completely insulted and just wanted to leave... Marissa, if you read this, please understand and take this as a learning tool.  If your a closer, you need to treat every table alike, and don't take other's food until everyone is done, it is a courtesy as others don't eat at the same pace, and psychologically is offensive.  I never understood my manager until tonight how irritating it really is.  I normally tip 25% or so, but i really felt between this, and the constant having to make someone aware we needed refills, and the fact that in mid-sentence, you and the previous server would just leave the table, I could not give you more.  Tip is something earned, and hopefully next time, if there is, you can work on these things... I know it was later in the shift, but the better you treat people, the better money you make!!  I shouldn't have to ask for refills, and you need to tell your hostesses to relay messages, because It was my birthday as well as my wife's friend.  That is why we went out and Other than the quality of food, tonight sucked as a birthday dinner.  The only reason we didn't bring it up is we were so irritated at being rushed out the door, you got your wish, we left.  You could have made almost 25 bucks instead of the 10 that you did.  Thats a lot of money in the scheme of things.  I am not mad, only disappointed and irritated I raved so much about it to be made a fool.  I really don't know whether or not I will go back, I might just stay local at Anaheim, but love Fashion Island, and thought it would be nicer...",92660

Bad sign.Our waiter was a Seacrest look-a-like who was just a bit too chirpy about working there. The table next to us was a group celebrating a birthday who acted like it was their first night out in 6 years. Bad signs...After we order some wine (in a chinese restaurant???) our waiter comes over and asks if we'd be interested in some special sauce (oh oh) he could make for us (oh oh). We cautiously say ok and goes on to mix the 3 sauces already on our table (soy, chili, and mustard). Wow, ingenious!The food comes and I think they forgot the add something... something called flavor. They did not forget the salt, that was for sure. Jeez. Nasty crap food, but the best is yet to come... On our way home I feel my stomach doing one of those dances where you start to look at the restaurants on the sides of the road wondering if their bathrooms are clean. I make it home but man oh man, worst stomach pain my life. I won't go into (too much) detail but it came out of both ends.

The manager did come over and handled it very poorly explaining that it wasn't their mistake, but a mistake of a mall security guard. My coworker and I discussed the right thing to do would be to provide any amount off the bill even 10% would show some level of understanding for the inconvenience.

Green beans were ok but not good enough to order next time around. But the star of my whole meal was the dynamite shrimp, it explodes in your mouth with tons of flavor. I could literally eat about a bucket full. What surprised me the most was the desert menu, I had a though time choosing.

I normally enjoy myself here but everything that could go wrong did. I wouldn't recommend this location ever. I called ahead for 2 people on a Friday night,quoted me 40-45 minutes, and we showed up maybe 5-10 minutes early. We checked in and the girl said it would be around our quote time so we waited...and waited...till we were finally 20 minutes over our quoted time. I asked what happened and a different girl said I was quoted an hour to and hour and fifteen minutes. I called her out and she asked the original girl I spoke to. They whispered amongst themselves for a while and said ""oh you're actually next"". Whatever.. So we're seated and our server takes her time to get to us. It took about 30 minutes to get our drinks. The lamb came out way over cooked. And to top it all off, I realized that I never got my credit card back. After searching my purse, pockets, and entire area surrounding the booth, I asked the waitress and she merely responded ""I always put the card in the front, sorry"". Seriously? I was a server for around 3 years so I know how it works. It takes a lot for me to complain but this was probably one of the worst experiences I have ever had. I was treated like I had no idea what I was doing or talking about. No one took the time to apologize for losing my card or our dry and overcooked food or for making us wait an exceedingly long period of time for everything.
