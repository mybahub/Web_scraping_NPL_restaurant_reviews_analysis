2,"7870 Monticello Ave Rancho Cucamonga, CA 91739",Brianne O.,"Upland, CA",8/2/2021,3,"We went here the other day for a birthday celebration...but we were a little bit disappointed with the menu options. They have changed since 3 years ago when we went. The main dish we got was the beef and broccoli but it wasn't that great. The Kung Pao Chicken was good though. The service wasn't really good either, our waiter never checked on us if we needed anything. Don't really think we will be coming back...",91739
3,"7870 Monticello Ave Rancho Cucamonga, CA 91739",Joe G.,"Chino Hills, CA",6/1/2021,3,So disappointed. The first time I've ever been disappointed at a PF Change. And I've been to many.So many things were wrong I'll just leave it at that! I won't be back to this one ever!,91739
4,"7870 Monticello Ave Rancho Cucamonga, CA 91739",Allyson Z.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",5/25/2021,1,"We ordered DoorDash Saturday and it was really awful and truly inedible. We had previously ordered from them, and although pricey, it seemed worth it because the food was excellent. But that wasn't the case this time! The Crispy Honey chicken (which we've ordered before) was so sickeningly sweet, I couldn't eat it this time. The rice had an odd after taste. Even my husband who isn't picky didn't like it! He tried something new, shrimp and lobster sauce which was also overly sweet. That was bizarre. I don't know if they have a new chef or something, but we won't be ordering from them again! I emailed their corporate office regarding this. DoorDash didn't refund the $58 we spent, so I feel like they should do something to make it right. I'll update if anything changes.Update:P.F. Chang's replied below but I already contacted you on your website? #confused ‍",91739

The Giant Horse outside and very nice Decor inside are a very nice touch to this Chinese/Japanese fusion restaurant. My favorite being the long picture of pretty woman Samurai with her Sword. Battered Prawns, Peking Duck and shrimp lo mein was delicious.",91739
6,"7870 Monticello Ave Rancho Cucamonga, CA 91739",Monica M.,"Eastvale, CA",7/5/2021,5,"My family and I had a great experience here for dinner while we were celebrating our little girls birthday.  The are it's located in has plenty of parking and outdoor shopping all around. I recommend calling ahead for reservations because the waiting area inside is small. The decor is beautiful and there is plenty of seating indoor and outdoor. Our server Mindy was absolutely amazing! I will ask for her everytime I go and I suggest you do too of you want excellent service.  She was very attentive, knowledgeable about the menu, and so sweet. We ordered fried rice, lo mein, orange chicken,  sesame chicken,  and honey crispy chicken. Everything tasted wonderful. I like that you have the option to use brown rice for the fried rice as a healthier option.  Mindy brought ice cream with deep fried banana eggroll for our little girls birthday. We had a wonderful time. This place is great for large parties and sharing dishes. They also have the QR scan for the menu and a QR scan to pay the bill at the end.",91739
7,"7870 Monticello Ave Rancho Cucamonga, CA 91739",Tk K.,"SoMa, San Francisco, CA",8/2/2021,5,"We had the delight of being waited on by Joy (male server at PF Chang's, Rancho Cucamonga). He radiated a kind of hospitality and welcome that put my whole group at ease. Throughout the meal, he seemed so connected to our dining needs that socializing, eating, drinking, and spending became effortless. You get the feeling that he's actually taking care of you, but so subtly and never intrusively. Friendly, yet refined. Ideal, astonishing, superb.     It's the kind of service you're willing to pay top$ for from the most upscale establishments, but rarely ever experience.(I'm not in the habit of writing reviews, but in commending Joy to his manager, the latter requested I express my wonderment in Yelp. Easily greater than 5 stars.)",91739

Spent the time to build an order online input six $50 gift cards that are all brand new unused and I continue to get it error message stating that one of the numbers is wrong.  So I re-input the card numbers, over and over again. I finally drive there and walk in the location to place my order and they the host tells me that I can't use gift cards online.  WTF! ....Then why in the world do you allow us to input gift cards on your website and then an error message that the card number is wrong when in fact you don't take your gift cards online! What a waste of my time!",91739

The food is always fresh and delicious. More importantly, the staff is extremely friendly and welcoming. The last three times we went, my mom and I had the same waitress, Marissa. She was friendly, attentive,  and did an excellent job making sure we had everything we needed to enjoy our lunch. I noticed that this PF Changs also remodeled the interior of the restaurant, and it looks even better than before! I highly recommend this place if you are going to Victoria Gardens.",91739
12,"7870 Monticello Ave Rancho Cucamonga, CA 91739",Brenda H.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",7/6/2021,1,"Be careful and order your chicken well done! Twice now I have ordered Kung Pao, my favorite dish, when it came to me it looked like normal but only cooked on the outside, but it was completely raw on the inside, I don't mean undercooked, I mean RAW when I cut it open. :( I'm sad cause I can't go back and have my favorite thing, the manager was nice and said she'd tell the chef and took the dish off, but if you've ever had to spit out raw chicken or chew until you figure out something isn't right, it's a game changer not to mention the danger to ones health. Should have comped the whole bill after knowing I ate 2 pieces of raw meat. Just order your meat well done and you should be ok.",91739
13,"7870 Monticello Ave Rancho Cucamonga, CA 91739",LaReina C.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",7/5/2021,3,There was an ex employee sitting at the bar with us bad mouthing the restaurant. It was kind of entertaining at first but she kept calling over people she used to work with to gossip. Made me not want to eat there anymore. Oh.. And the abundance of gnats or fruit flies or whatever they were flying all over the bar. It should have been closed there were so many. I was so annoyed that I couldn't even eat. Drank my pretty drink and left.,91739
14,"7870 Monticello Ave Rancho Cucamonga, CA 91739",Jackie W.,"Apple Valley, CA",3/10/2021,4,"Absolutely amazing From the service, to the prices, bathrooms were clean. Only comment is the crab Rangoons are very dry inside when I prefer more of a cream cheese and crab. but they do come with a ginger-type sauce to dip them in.",91739

16,"7870 Monticello Ave Rancho Cucamonga, CA 91739",Jerry C.,"Upland, CA",7/11/2021,2,"PF Chang's use to be one of my FAVORITE places.  I have been craving it for awhile and finally had a chance to go.  I placed an order for my favorites, the Orange Chicken and fried rice.  And when it came out, I was shocked to see they came out with a ""new recipe"" and I have to admit it is horrible and the fried rice lacked any flavor.  It is sad to see this once a favorite place change for the worse, and yet they found it fit, to raise their prices and give you less food.  If you are looking for Chinese food, check out Panda Inn located not far in Ontario.",91739

Let me first say it's not easy accommodating all those orders and special requests without a great waiter. Especially in a filled restaurant. Edward and his team have earned these kudos for playing such a role to make it all happen!  Anyone who can get 13 orders right with all the drinks and great appetizers making there way first, allowing us plenty of time to enjoy them- before wonderful entrees- should be applauded!  Clap clap clap. Great job people, PF Changs service did not disappoint! Thank you Edward and the team!!!",91739

We were so lucky to get Andrew as our server, he was AMAZING! Our food was good, blah blah blah, but Andrew was seriously the best. So kind and on top of everything. Thank you Andrew, we haven't been out to a real nice dinner in months and you made tonight great! And you can't go wrong with the Mongolian beef and Kung pao shrimp, YUM!",91739

We ordered a variety of plates, the service was great, I don't think there up to speed yet, but there getting there, there food is good, but before covid, it was amazing, duck plate a little dry, beef and broccoli ok, calamari was great, lo mean noodles were good but added chicken dry.

20,"7870 Monticello Ave Rancho Cucamonga, CA 91739",Melad G.,"La Verne, CA",5/23/2021,1,"Worst service ever. First we went in because all other descent restaurants had at least 1hr wait and we were surprised to be given a table (8 people) at this restaurant immediately with no wait..Waiter brought all drinks except mine and he finally got it after more than five minutes.We finished our appetizers then they started serving main course without removing all the empty plates of the appetizers. Waiter then came laughing and saying they would normally put the main course dishes in the middle for all to sharr. I told him we would like them in the middle but they first should remove those empty dishes. He looked at me and said ""My man i am working on it""!!!!We were all served our main course except for my son.. we waited for another 5 minutes with no delivery... waiter was going to other tables. I then asked the waiter if there was a problem with my son's dish? He said without even appologizing that he simply needs to grab it from the kitchen .. and then asked me if i need to talk to his manager!!!! I was really surprised at his impolitness and attitude and told him yes get me your manager..After another 5 min another wierd guy and even more impolite came in with my son's plate and left it on the table without saying a word.. i asked if he was the manager and he said yes.. i told him is this a way of providing service and he immediately turned rude and told me not to yell at him (which at this stage i never did and was still trying to get only a proper appology and acknowledgment that they will take care of their service)... at this point, i realized why this place was empty and why we got a table immediately.. looked at this guy and told him to stop talking and to get me the restaurant manager.. and obviously this was another waste of time. A lady came and was useless and not even understanding the basis of customer management !!!! No wonder all her staff are having this attitude...We then decided to leave in the middle of our main course and the manager came and said that we are not welcomed and we will not be asked to pay the bill !!!!!!!!!!!!!!Pathetic staff and managers .. food was normal but with this service ... hahahaha .. they should all get fired. Owner, if you care about your franchise, monitor your staff and choose them carefully.",91739
21,"7870 Monticello Ave Rancho Cucamonga, CA 91739",joelle m.,"Colton, CA",3/19/2021,3,"I never get to eat P.F. Chang's because I am rarely in the area. Today I decided to treat myself and get my favorite- Dynamite Shrimp. I ordered curbside pickup because of Covid-19. I have to say, though the flavors were there, I was let down with how much they gave me. Unless it suddenly started coming with 5 shrimp? It also wasn't crunchy like it usually is. :( feeling like maybe I should have gotten something else. I understand the pandemic has made things harder but I still feel strongly that that should not affect the quality of how the food is cooked and prepared. I'll definitely go again because I have more things I want to try but today, I am disappointed.",91739

Chang's Xian warrior statue in the main dining room was bedecked with a Santa's cap on his head.We began with delicious and mild pan-fried Handmade Shrimp Dumplings and a bowl of Wonton Soup filled with six nude but crunchy shrimp hiding within each assembled wonton.  Then it was specially prepared Miso-marinated Chilean Sea Bass for Diane, and Mongolian Beef with sweet Soy Sauce, Flank Steak, Garlic, Green Peppers, and Onion for me, since my favorite of Wok-Fired Filet & Potatoes has now been replaced on the dinner menu by a Korean Bulgogi Steak that features a New York Strip Steak covered with a Mongolian glaze.  The Mongolian Beef was very tasty, and not too tough.  It was accompanied by cooked spinach bathed in a Soy Ginger Sauce.  Everything was washed down nicely with Oolong Dragon Eye Tea and Citrus Tea.Service by Tayler was very fine, except during the dinner I received only one water refill when I needed two.  Booth seating was comfortable.  An excellent meal, and XXXX-1/2 stars overall!",91739

Turned out to be a good choice. You can order from their Happy Hour menu for 1 hour longer and you can order from the whole menu while sitting in the bar. Win! To start we had Sake and an Asian Pear Mojito. Great choices. The mojo to was the right combination of sweet and mint. We ordered vegetarian lettuce wraps, fried green beans and veggie sushi. All were very good. For entrees we had the Hokkien Street Noodles with no meat and subbed in tofu. And no oyster sauce. Delicious.  I had the Buddha's Feast with tofu and white rice. Also delicious. Since we had so many appetizers between 2 people we had food left to take home. All in all a pleasant dining experience. Our waitress/bartender was excellent. I think I'll dine in the bar every time!",91739

I made a reservation for the both of us (Highly Recommended) for dinner. This P.F. Chang's is located at Victoria's Garden. In my personal opinion, parking could be an issue, depending on the time of day, so plan ahead. When we arrived, we were welcomed and had to wait for a table to be ready. When our table was ready, we were anxious and wanted to see the menu. For the menu, you can ask for a paper menu or if you have a QR Reader app, you can scan the barcode to see the menu. Our server arrived (Wesley) and he greeted us and was very hospitable; made the night very pleasant. We went ahead and ordered: Chang's Lettuce Wrap (Chicken), Mongolian Beef, Combination Fried Rice, Combination Lo Mein & Crispy Honey Chicken. We waited for our order for a bit and Wesley was always checking up on us. Our order arrived and we could smell that it was prepared fresh. All of our dishes that we placed, had plenty of flavor and we both were totally satisfied with our meal. My overall experience was excellent and the customer service we received from Wesley, was outstanding. He went above and beyond and checked up on us, asked if we wanted refills and chatted a bit with us. In my personal opinion, I would definitely recommend P.F. Chang's at the Rancho Cucamonga location. Next time we come, we would like to try their other items on their menu.",91739

I am just very grateful they offer gluten free options, due to my gluten intolerance. I believe the biggest reason why I continue to visit this location is because of the exceptional service.

37,"7870 Monticello Ave Rancho Cucamonga, CA 91739",Heidi J.,"Azusa, CA",10/18/2020,4,"Today I wanted to write this review based on the customer service alone. Pfchangs is known for its fresh food and drink menu. But the other day, Judy and Christian L. Really made our experience special. At the Victoria Gardens location, they had three different patio locations. Judy took me all over to see which area might be to my liking, as my father is diabetic and really couldn't be in the Sun at all. I thought I found the right spot under a tree where it was shady, our server Christian came over to deliver the drinks and wouldn't you know it, there was a bee that would just not leave us alone. Poor Christian over here doing the most trying to protect us to make sure we didn't get stung. Unfortunately the little rascal wouldn't go away and we had to switch to a different location. I apologized that it seemed as though we were being a bother but both Christian and Judy we're so kind and friendly, assuring us that the bee would not get in the way of providing great customer care. The food is always really good here, we ordered the veggie spring rolls which I really enjoyed great crunch fresh veggies. My dad really liked the dynamite shrimp which had a spicy orange sauce on top of it. As far as entrees we ordered the orange chicken pepper steak and shrimp fried rice along with shrimp pad thai noodles. All of which were really good. The food never disappoints here but I must say I haven't had wonderful customer service like that in a very long time. Honestly, I thought Judy was the manager the way that she carried herself and just had the best personality. And our server, Christian L., he was amazing! Can't wait to come back!",91739

Service: The food was serviced quickly and still really hot. The waiter was very friendly & patient at explaining the menu items. Food: the food was absolutely delicious. The way the food is serviced is in a large bowl and everyone has an individual plate so they can serve themselves as much/ little as they want.

The same thing happened the last time we ordered and we thought it was because of covid. There is nothing more heartbreaking than spending money on food that is inedible. The kung poa was burnt!

There was some things I liked, like the waiter mostly , he made the lunch worth it . The food is unimpressive to be honest but I give them an extra star for having a gluten free menu and for the wonderful waiter . If it wasn't for those 2 things I probably would have given 3 stars . Am I the only one who hates the table set up in the middle ? I mean it was busy on a Sunday for lunch but I feel like my back was against someone else's back next to us. Super claustrophobic and uncomfortable. I won't be back , and that sucks because I really wanted to love it .",91739

Chang's, first i would like to start off when I arrived inside the restaurant I was greeted immediately by a hostess Maddie I believe. Then i was sat in a span to 20-30 min which was perfect. Although my waiter did take a while to bring me my refreshments, ( I mean comon how long does a dirty martini take to make LOL) all okay tho as I was still being served my food fast. I got my pork dumplings pan fried , they were impeccable. But I can't say the same for the chang's chicken, already having too much sauce and garnish on it , I can just taste the reused soy sauce that they used to whip it up I can not say i'm a fan of one of there signature dishes. The fried rice tasted like it was from panda express to be honest and that's not too much of a down side. But to top things off my noodles where amazing just enough soy sauce to make me happy. I finished my evening off with a super sized pice of there chocolate cake it was amazing with each individual layer. I can't say that I would come back for that chang's chicken, but with the hospitality that I received here I think I'll give it another shot.",91739

He was very professional and patient with us. We ordered Signature Lo Mein, Buddha's feast, Thai Harvest Curry, Crispy honey chicken and Banana spring roll dessert. They give you white or brown rice complimentary such was good. Everything was delicious and we finished everything. Our waiter Christian was really attentive to us therefore making the experience better. Great job!!The restaurant was very elegant and clean when I checked it out.Restaurant has a very nice painting in the middle that made you feel you are in China. Parking is busy be a you are in Victoria Gardens on a weekend .  More parking available if you just park a little farther we found space for like 10 -15 cars.I definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone whom has not been here before.",91739

I order catering frequently from other restaurants at VG (including PF Chang's) and was never asked to wait no more than 20-30 mins. I get it, places get busy. Today I was asked to wait 1 hour and 30 minutes after my pick up time by the hostess. It wasn't until another hostess clocked in (by this time my fourth attempt at getting my food) and I asked for her help, that things started moving. The other people that walked in and ordered at the front table, while I was waiting, got their orders before I did (all of course were your token Rancho citizen). If you must order from here, do car pick up, that way they don't discriminate. A joke.",91739

Very fresh tasting and the quality of the ingredients are very noticeable. All our dishes were fresh and tasted very good. The only complaint was that the beef in the Beef A La Sichuan was mostly vegetables. Besides that we will return for the tasty fresh food.,91739

It takes a few minutes and you'll save yourself the hour wait times.The service was extremely prompt from start to finish, and all of the waiters here are very friendly, attentive and caring.Ordered quite a bit here the other night - chicken lettuce wraps, white rice, lo-mein noodles, asian ceasar salad, edamame, kung pao chicken, honey shrimp, hot & sour soup, & wonton soup, as well as a few drinks.Everything was absolutely delicious with the exception of the Hot & Sour soup which tasted plain, and not what I would expect from a Hot & Sour Soup. The waiter also agreed was not one of their best-tasting soups. That said if you are looking for a soup from here I would recommend trying out the Wonton Soup.",91739

I'm used to low and slow American BBQ so these were disappointing, except for the sauce which was good. (11.50)Sesame Chicken was just ok. (15.95)Mongolian Beef is always a solid choice here. It was good. (19.95) Crispy Honey Shrimp were delicious (18.50)Beef Sichuan was standard, slightly spicy.

The egg rolls were so tiny. The chicken was sparse in the Kung Pao Chicken and dry, much like the rubber sole of a slipper. Singapore noodles were terrible with very little shrimp or chicken. The vegetable fried rice barely had no veggies. As the food was heavily cooked in oil and had no spice or taste, it all tasted the same. We had made a birthday reservation. It was the worst experience I have ever had. Sadly the food is terrible but two years ago their food was the best. Today it's worst than Frozen Chinese food. The customer service was a huge disappointment as well beginning from the ladies at the check in desk by the door. The waiters are awkward and lack customer service skills. The whole experience is lackluster. And what's with the tiny plates for the entrees? They are the size of of an appetizer plate. A four star place gone to zero stars. Whatever happened to the ghost peppers?! No flavor. Nasty food. Normally in the past the host would pack the left overs but not this time. These people do not seem happy to have customers' business or even be working. Totally bad vibes over all. The food is not the waiters fault though.

Chang's is for people who really don't like Chinese food. Both are deeply Americanized to make them 'friendly' to the inexperienced palette. I truly believe that places like this thrive only due to inexperience with authentic, ethnic cuisines, largely due to inaccessibility.In major metros, almost anything is well represented but in small towns and rural areas, it's almost exclusively chains like these so the food need not compete with 'the real thing' or even just something better. This is garbage, plain & simple. In NYC or Chicago, this wouldn't last a week (except in tourist areas-the old adage about NYC is ""it's impossible to get a bad meal with such massive competition""-but go to Times Square, Rock and other tourist traps and bad food exists even in NYC itself). Treat yourself to Chinese in SGV like the spectacular Chengdu Taste or Red Chilies in RC, you'll never eat this dreck again.",91739

The settings were ready and clean. They helped sit our infant daughter quickly. The waitress Rey was amazing! We told her that our daughter had a life threatening peanut allergy and a mild egg allergy and she made amazing things happen. Not only did she get us a matrix of the foods our daughter could eat, she asked the chefs the be hyper aware of cross contamination, and even had the chicken that was dredged in egg taken out and everything recooked. That woman is amazing! I left a great compliment with the manager in duty and our family gave her a good tip. She elevated our dining experience and she would be a reason we came back! As our usual, we got chicken lettuce wraps, beef Sichuan, Chang's spicy chicken, and orange peel chicken, and kids chicken fried rice and our white rice. The food was delicious and spicy.

We ordered the pork pan friend dumplings appetizer- just ok. You could taste the pork like it was not fresh. Also ordered 2 rolls- both of which tasted fishy.For veggies- we had the brussel sprouts which was mixed with pineapple- not a favorite at all and they should consider excluding the pineapple. Just an odd pairing. Finally we had their walnut shrimp with melon which was good.I get this is Asian fusion but food should be good especially for the amount you are paying.

Of course we ended up cancelling the order because at this point everyone is starving and frustrated. Thank you PF Changs for being inconsiderate.

Our wait turned out to be an hour and 15 minutes which we didn't mind. However when an hour had hit we noticed the hostess was saying that walk ins wouldn't be able to sit inside but were available to sit outside and they immediately were seated. I understand the inside was full but she could've offered the outside area for the people who have been waiting for an hour or more. At this point an hour 15 had passed and the hostess had told our party we were third on the list and another party they were sixth. A high table had opened up in the bar area and she offered it to the party of 3 that was sixth on the list instead of our party of 4 that had gotten there before and we were waiting longer. This really upset us and we continued to wait maybe ten more minutes. Eventually we were seated and the service and food really made us feel better. Super grateful for our waitress she was very attentive and helpful! She definitely made the experience far better than how it started. The food was so good as well.

The mu shu is so scrumptious and it's entertaining to watch how the table server delicately assembles the wraps while using hoisin sauce to stick it to itself. That way it won't open up and cascade all over your plate on the first bite. PF Changs is kinda mainstream but they have put their own twist on several classic Chinese dishes. Their dark paneled and dimly lit restaurant sets a unique and cozy environment. And they provide a classy presentation of all their dishes offered.,91739

Each of the three of us ordered and appetizer and an entree each for a group share.  We were all so terribly disappointed.  One dish out of the 6 (should be 5 since soup never was delivered) was a 3.5-4 stars.  One was cold and sent back; one was severely overcooked and lacked flavor, and on and on.  I don't know if there was a chef in the kitchen or just someone trying to cook something for what was ordered.  Needless to say, it was a very disappointing experience and I would encourage you to first order one or two items for take out before going to do Al Fresco dining for an event.",91739

But I guess to the general public all Asian food is the same. I tried it and it was really good so I would definitely recommend it, but for most people that's not why they would come. They also have a running special that I think is great. It's like $60 for two people and you get essentially 4 courses.

Christian L was like don't worry if you change your mind just let me know. To our surprise when he brought out our soup and egg rolls and drinks he had chicken lettuce wraps and I asked him to show my boyfriend how delicious they look and he said ""Oh these are for you guys""!

FYI even if you do put your name on the list they are supposed to text you sayin your table is ready... we got no text! So don't wait in your car or do any shopping when your name is on the list might as well just sit there and wait. We missed our call and had to wait a little longer for a table.

I called back and spoke to Edward who handled the whole thing . He reversed my bill and sent me 50.00 gift card . Thank you Edward for getting back with me and handling everything to your best capacity. I spoke to corporate and spoke to Amy and A Jessica .

Spoke back to Amy and I told her that's what I get for getting sick on my birthday and missing a day of work ???!!! I told her I work for customer service for more than 20 years and 25.00 extra gift card is unacceptable. Amy was very rude and insulting when she said to me .. OH YOU WORK FOR CUSTOMER SERVICE AND YOU GET PAID  MORE THAN 100 A DAY ??? Well ofcourse I do !!!! I'm not gonna let this slide by ...

None of it compares to the cheap Chinese food on the corner. Several choices, there's got to be something everyone would like.  Each entree comes with white or brown rice. Cons: holy crap it's expensive. $16 a plate and it only comes with the side of Rice. $11 for Lo mein. It's meant to be ""family style"" where you order to share. I don't want to share my plate because I could eat the whole thing by myself. That's right. Because the portions are not big. I get it, hubby and I each got one and split it, which was great, except I liked the one I ordered better and I didn't want to share anymore. So next time I won't. I'll be getting my own plate and I won't feel guilty about not sharing. Bottom line: Food was amazing. If I have $55 to drop on dinner for 2 people ( my 3 children weren't even involved for that) just because I feel like it, than you bet your butt I'll be back.

Kind of disappointed that they didn't have Tokyo Udon noodles available on the weekends, it's only available during the week before 4pm.

I ordered a meal online and it stated it would be ready at 6:08. Upon arrival I called to let them know where I was parked and it took them forever to bring my food out. Almost 40mins later the guy comes with my receipt only to tell me that he'll be right back with my food!!! Are you kidding me!?!? I waited another 10 mins for him to bring my food only for me to make it back home and it's wrong!!! I asked for no mushrooms and I have them in my Lo mein chicken (yuck). I also ordered fried rice and it is so mushy I can't even believe they're serving this. It took almost an hour for me to get my damn food.

I ordered Singapore Street Noodles and she went with Crispy Honey Shrimp. We also had Appetizers and beverage.  I asked the waiter (not) to put shrimp in the Noodles, just add extra chicken. (Usually comes with both), but I am allergic to shrimp. So he goes on about that is how they usually do it when they hold the shrimp etc. That was fine. I also noticed he wrote nothing down. Now the food comes and my (wife) has a plate full of chicken. So the server takes it away to correct the dish with Shrimp. Now, I stir my Noodles and (Shrimp) are in the dish. So I am sitting here waiting for the waiter to return or server or someone to tell them my order is wrong. I had to flag down the person seating people and she said she would tell my waiter. He still didn't come, a lady came and said she was in charge of the kitchen, I think, and asked me if I was allergic to Oysters because they use Oyster Sauce in the dish. In the mean time I am still waiting for food. If the waiter had came back to check on his customer, I could have sent my dish back and maybe both dishes could have been delivered at the same time so we could enjoy our meal together. I have been coming here for years. This is the first time I have been here during the Covid-19 situation. This was the WORST service and experience that I have had at a so called decent restaurant in years. Not one offer of anything to try to make up for ruining a beautiful afternoon. I was at Flemings Restaurant for our anniversary dinner a few years ago and they compted a $200 dinner because the cook didn't cook the meat correctly. Our waiter sent his manager to our table and (she) out of the blue took care of it because she said she wanted us to have a great experience. This mgr, waiter, or whoever should understand it is not the customers fault when they screw up the order. So I paid $80 bucks to be extremely disappointed on such a beautiful day.

149,"7870 Monticello Ave Rancho Cucamonga, CA 91739",Joshua T.,"Upland, CA",1/13/2018,3,"So my wife and I have been here before and it wasn't too bad. This time around there was a longer wait which was expected for a Saturday evening. After waiting our time, about 45 minutes we were seated out on the patio. Unfortunately it seems that we were forgotten because no one came out to take our order let alone our drink order for nearly 10 more minutes after being seated. A bus boy came outside and was clearing tables and stared right at me as I watched, and he shook his head because the table wasn't being clean. He then walked inside and back out with more cleaning supplies. A server then came outside and gave another couple food and then walked back inside without even looking our way. Finally our server came out and took our drink, appetizer, and main course order all at the same time because we waited for so long, we knew what we were going to eat before he even came out once for our drinks.I understand it being slow because it's busy, but if people are sitting outside there should be a dedicated server for the patios only so no one is forgotten. A completely different server came out within 3 minutes after the table beside ours was sat down and they were seated nearly 20 minutes after we were. The table beside ours also had beer, water, and their appetizer plates before we got our water. Further they received their appetizer itself and their main course prior to us receiving our food. Their server even came over and asked if our server had even taken our main course order yet. They were halfway done with their dinner before ours was even delivered. I will say though, the only reason this is 3 stars is because the food we ordered was superb so compliments to the chef, otherwise this would have been 1.",91739

I went in with no to low expectations and left with a new go-to restaurant. The food was excellent, the variety of dishes were great, they pride themselves on making things fresh and in-house and the price was great for the amount of food we got and the quality. Only complaint was the cucumber limeade was too tangy, but other than that everything tastes great! My favorites were the curry, citrus or orange chicken and dumplings. Tried the pad-Thai and it was good but not my favorite. The real winner was the house noodles which were delicious and so tasty! I'd definitely recommend if you're looking to try something different.

I was told oh sure, just do it when you come in to pick up your order. I explained to the gentlemen that I was told I could order a drink to go when I called on the phone.

Needless to say he was very rude and it was apparent he did not want to service me. My husband paid and asked for sauce for the food, and was told we only have a select few sauces to choose from. My husband says ok I would like soy sauce and hit mustard please. We get the food and we ask is all our food in here? He says yes it is and pushes the food at us.

At 5:30pm we still hadn't received our order and noticed that other people had received theirs. I had to ask the hostess about our order again.

166,"7870 Monticello Ave Rancho Cucamonga, CA 91739",Alysha S.,"Ontario, CA",5/14/2020,1,"Ordered online on Friday for the Mother's Day special on Sunday for delivery at 1pm.  At 1pm we get an alert that the door dash driver is there waiting for our food. Later we get a text that the order is so delayed they will go back later. It's now 2pm, we call the restaurant who puts us on hold for 20 minutes and then they say they are working on our order. Then we get a text from door dash that our order has been canceled. We call again. We have to explain the whole thing again. They put us on hold then after 10 minutes we get disconnected. Call back. Explain again. They say we have to call door dash to redo our order. Let me be clear we did not order through door dash we ordered on Friday through PF Chang's. They are the ones who worked with door dash why do we have to call door dash now? They say they'll call us back. 25 minutes later no call. It's after 3pm now. We call back. Explain again. This person says oh your food has been ready since 2pm just no one has come to pick it up. We should call door dash to come pick it up or pick it up ourselves. Uh-uh. No way. And now our food is old. Oh but it's fine they say it's on a warmer. Finally since this door dash thing will never be resolved they send one of their employees to deliver the food. The food doesn't arrive until 4pm. We ordered it for 1pm. It's luke warm. And of course, cherry on top, they put brown rice instead of steamed rice. Should have order from Panda Inn food is better and cheaper and their fortune cookies have white chocolate on them. And the one time they forgot the won-ton soup they drove back immediately. I will never order from here again. What a waste of my happy Mother's Day.",91739

172,"7870 Monticello Ave Rancho Cucamonga, CA 91739",Ana C.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",5/11/2020,2,"My family and I were extremely disappointed on PF Chang Mothers Day service. My husband ordered our meal 7 days in advance and was told his pick up time was Sunday at 1:30 pm. He got there at 1:00 pm just to check in and be there when it was ready and was told his meal would be delayed 1 1/2 hours. So basically his order wouldn't be ready till 3 pm. That is bad enough but PF Chang was still taking walk up orders when they were so behind the established and paid orders. When a few customers complained they were told that the way their system works, their computers make the latest order appear first. The people that wanted to cancel their orders would not get a cash refund just a gift card. Which was no use in getting a meal to the mothers and families that were waiting at home.  So even though my husband ordered 5 days before, the people that order that day or day before would come up before his order. He did not get his order till 3:40 pm. 2 hours and 10 minute after it was scheduled for pickup. He had to sit all those hours in a car and it was a hot day. Then he gets home and the order is partially wrong and cheated. There were no condiments in the bag. The bowls of orders of edamame, fried rice and chow Mein/noodles were less than  half full. That  is wrong and your charged us for full orders and cheated us. Plus we ordered half white rice and half brown. There was 0 white rice in the order. You need to work on your system.  What we did eat minus the people who hate brown rice, got extremely small portions of the cheated dishes and missed the condiments said it was good but the wait and cheated portions were not worth it.",91739

We placed a online order DAYS in advance and paid almost $200 for a curbside pick up. We get to the restaurant and park in the curbside and notice SO MANY people waiting outside. We call the number for the store to tell them we have arrived and no one answers for about 5 mins. So here I am pregnant and trying to stay away from people but have no choice to get off with my sisters to get our food picked up. They have a guy standing outside who is doing nothing but informing people that they are behind and that it is a 3 hour delay to get your food. Wtf?!? 3 HOURS?! And they don't have the  Decency or Courtesy to give us a call or email letting us know that we will not have a Mother's Day dinner! They knew since early on that they were having trouble fulfilling orders but had NO ONE let us know before having us waste our time driving all the way down there for NOTHING. They had people outside who were waiting for almost 4 hours! They let us know if we wanted to wait or cancel and of course we were NOT going to wait any longer. We had to wait in a long line with a lot of other people who were trying to cancel as well and had to give them our name and order number for our order to be canceled in the next couple of days. My family and I had no choice but to go to the store to try and buy something to make at home last minute and also not to mention that we are in a meat shortage so there was only so much that we could buy! I don't think we've ever been so furious before. Next time P.F. Chang's please don't advertise for something you guys cannot fulfill and put a LIMIT on what you CAN handle!

Chang's.  Only reason we went because we had a gift card and we need to use it.Came here Sunday during lunch and waited 5 mins to be seated.  Hostess was very friendly and nice!First, we started off with: Crispy Green Beans-(Tempura-battered and served with our signature spicy dipping sauce)Huge appetizer portion! Dipping sauce taste mayo mixed in some kind of spicy sauce and goes well with the crispy green beans.  (Must get!)Chili-Garlic Green Beans- (Spicy fiery red chili sauce, fresh garlic and Sichuan preserves) This would have to be my favorite plus the Wok-Seared Spinach with Garlic- (Spinach with garlic fresh spinach leaves with chopped garlic)But if your not a into garlic, then stay away from these appetizer.  I love anything that is spicy and tons of garlic!  Then came the lunch entrée:Chang's Spicy Chicken-(Signature sweet-spicy chili sauce and green onion)I loved this too!  Chicken was crispy and reminds me of eating Orange Chicken.  Sweet and Spicy altogether.Beef with Broccoli-(Flank steak, ginger-garlic aromatics, green onion, steamed broccoli) Beef was good. Sweet taste to it.  Overall, I had a great experience here at this location.It actually changed my mind on eating at any P.F. location now.Definitely a fan and would recommend ordering all of above.",91739

200,"7870 Monticello Ave Rancho Cucamonga, CA 91739",David G.,"Fontana, CA",2/8/2018,5,"So I see everyone doesnt enjoy this place like I do. What?!? I really love this place. I love everything about this place except for the wait cause of all those who feel like me about this place. The ambiance, food, drinks, service, price all great! THE FOOD- I really have not had a dish I did not like. I have probably tried 75% of the menu items. Like to start with lettuce wraps and sometimes have this only. They don't make the sauce at the table anymore unless you request for them too. Also, like the crispy green beans with the dipping sauce. They are constantly coming out with new dishes & if you sign up for their club they send offers to try new, sometimes not on the menu items. The veggies in all dishes are always fresh and have great flavor. I like most chicken & beef dishes I can really just blindly choose from the menu and trust that I will enjoy! I can't even tell you what my favorite dish is cause it really depends on what I'm feelin'. I think this is the only place that I love and don't have 1 favorite, stand-alone, gotta have each time dish. I love that there are so many flavors & trying new dishes I have uncovered new gems! DRINKS- so I do have a favorite here & that's the Asian Pear Mojito. They do have a great full bar that when the restaurant if full this is a great option & you can order from the menu so that 1-hour wait can be avoided. They make a great old fashion and they have a bunch of signature drinks but I usually stick to my mojito.SERVICE is usually really good but just like anywhere its only as good as the mood of your server that night. We have never had any problems.Now that I live close to one I go pretty often. Ill keep you all posted!",91739

The avocado Lobster rolls and California rolls make great starter's. However, you can't go wrong with the lettuce wraps!! We were a bit sad when they remove the lemon chicken from the menu. The orange chicken, Kung pow chicken, honey chicken and broccoli beef are fantastic. Don't forget to add a chicken Fried rice to the order. Service is always excellent. However, sometimes kitchen times or how long it takes to deliver the food can get a bit long. They always keep my tea filled and often ask if I would like a Togo cup!!",91739

It also didn't smell very fresh. My nieces noodles were really greasy as well. She was super hungry so she just ate it. The only semi ok thing we're the dumplings.

As we entered we received phenomenal service right off the bat. Once we were seated at our table Daniel introduced himself right away and had very high great energy. He kept a conversation with us and kept our drink filled always. We never had to ask for items as he noticed we ran out of certain things he had it there immediately.

I will say I was surprised by how many people were having heavy duty drinks during the day. I ordered a passion fruit ice tea and had the spring rolls appetizers. I haven't been to this restaurant in a while, but remembered I liked the honey melon walnut shrimp dish which wasn't as great as I remembered it, but holy smokes, I decided to get dessert and ordered the banana caramel egg rolls with pineapple coconut ice cream and I just about fell out of my chair-Insanely Delicious!  I'm glad I stopped here.",91739

Almost a week ago, she placed an online order for Mothers Day and scheduled a 430 pick-up. With family at home waiting for me to pick up Mothers Day dinner, I arrived at 425 and walked up to the PF Changs representative that was standing outside. I gave him my order number ( (589248954) and he told me to check back in 1.5-2 hours! So the 430 pick up time for our food was BS. I had to break the news to my wife that her Mothers Day dinner that she had been looking forward to for almost a week wasnt going to haapppen.

When we informed the waiter that our meal included a dessert he said he would talk to the manager. The manager who didn't even come out sent the message that there was nothing he could do about it. So I asked for the managers name and corporate number, to which another manager came out and said she has reversed the transaction.By far one of the worst experiences, hopefully they get it together because for a manager to say nothing can be done is unacceptable.",91739

We ordered dinner - I had asked for the gluten free menu allergy not preference and when I placed the order server did not ask any questions. After tasting the soup and could not handle the vomit like texture I placed the big bowl and small bowls at the end of the table.

258,"7870 Monticello Ave Rancho Cucamonga, CA 91739",Ed E.,"Victorville, CA",9/15/2018,2,"A couple of weeks ago my wife and I went to P.F. Chang's in Rancho Cucamonga. I've been to multiple P.F. Chang's over the years but they definitely are NOT my favorite Chinese restaurant. I've almost never seen an actual Chinese waiter or waitress at any of the locations, which is what I expect when I visit a Chinese Restaurant. In the past, we almost always ordered their lettuce wraps, which I like very much. For this latest visit, though, all we ordered was Orange Peel Chicken and Kung Pao Chicken.My wife and I both liked the Orange Peel Chicken very much. It had much more sauce than I see in the picture shown on the P.F. Chang's website. The sauce flavor was absolutely delicious. The chicken was very tender and juicy. However, I really do not think it is worth the $14.95 price.The Kung Pao Chicken, on the other hand, was among the worst I've ever eaten (and I've eaten Kung Pao Chicken at dozens of Chinese restaurants). Unlike the picture on their website, which shows a full bowl of chicken, peanuts, and green onion covered in sauce, we got nowhere near that amount of food and, more importantly, there was very little sauce covering the chicken. In other words, the dish was very dry. Perhaps I should have questioned the waiter about this, but I would have hoped that since the waiter probably knows what the dish should look like, he would not have brought it to us if the dish was not up-to-par. The dish we were served was maybe worth $6.95, not the $16.95 we were charged.Sad to say, I was very disappointed in this visit. The week before we had eaten at Panda Inn. Their food was way better.It will be a long time, if ever, before I visit P.F. Chang's again.Disclaimer: This is an honest review of my visit. I have no relationship to any other restaurant, Chinese or other, that would cause me to give a biased review. Thank you for reading my review.",91739

First off let me start by saying I used to serve at restaurants and I understand how busy it can get and how rude other guests can be. I started an online order from their website due to it be free delivery. I was at the last section of checking out and it wasn't allowing me to give me an option of a gift card my husband received for his birthday. I looked throughout the website before I called to ask the reasoning for this. I went directly to take out and asked one lying lady didn't know and asked politely to put me on hold well she gets a manager. It took her a few minutes before another woman came on the phone and was very short and wasn't even the manager and went to get he manager. A few minutes later I spoke to a woman named Joann she wasn't rude but lacked hospitality. I explained my situation and wasn't sure why my card wasn't working online and asked for the card number to check the balance. She asked to put me on hold again. I was on hold for 25 minutes before they hung up on me. I called back and was again transfers to 4 other people before I finally spoke to Joann again. She explained there was nothing on my card when I called before hand and verified there was $50. She also said she still didn't know why online wouldn't accept it and I could pick it up. I have a four year old and an infant and my main reason was DELIVERY! She tried my card again and this time her computer wouldn't allow her to input all the digits. She said she needed to call IT then give me a call back. At this point I was feed up I have a 4 year old who is hungry, I'm hungry and my husband. I have been on the phone trying to order for now over 40 minutes. She said she would call me back and was about to hang up without getting my name or number it took my husband to say, "" well don't you want our number and name""?!!! She said oh yes. She called back in about 15-20 minutes saying PF. Chang's doesn't accept gift cards anymore she said so I think I have solved the problem is there anything else. I said no and hung up. My husband had already orders it without using the gift card and when the food arrived it was dry, cold, tasteless. It lacked flavor it lacked color it lacked being food. I ended up making my family spaghetti which I should've done in the first place. The only nice thing about this order was the delivery driver who was working with door dash. A sweet older man who was friendly. I will NEVER order from this restaurant or any PF Chang's again. The food is awful the customer service is worse. Do not waste your time or money.Updates review: PF Chang's reached out to me about sending my review to their company through yelp never got a response. Worst customer services  and an worse company.

Chang's tonight from Door Dash. (I get it, lazy, don't judge). I was very apprehensive about ordering PF Changs, because I like the food to be a certain way (nothing too crazy), and every time, in the past, they've either completely missed the mark, or the sauce recipe changed and was horrible. I decided to give it a go.  I was very specific about how i wanted the minimal items prepared. I love to put the honey sauce on the fried rice, and my son loves the children's crispy honey chicken dish. Ordered those. Wrote in two separate places that i wanted extra honey sauce. Waited on the food, food arrives, I ask the kid if the sauce is in the bag, before he leaves. ""uh yeah, its all there."" he says, and leaves. I check the bag. Of course... it's not there. I'm just picky enough to not like the rice without the sauce, so this is an issue. Also, the children's chicken is dry, no sauce, no seasoning... nothing. Bland and dry. No bueno. I tried to call door dash, and they conveniently don't have an easy way of contacting them. I reach out to P.F. Chang's. Request to speak to a manager. Edward gets on the phone and proceeds to have to listen to me rant and scream for 10min about how they always mess up the order, and how I'm so mad etc. etc.... I realize about half way into my rant how ridiculous i must appear, screaming because of honey sauce, but at this point, the food will go uneaten by the child and I, wasting money, and this ISN'T the first time this has happened. I'm mad. He sat patiently waiting until I finished and then asks how he can fix it. He's genuine. He WANTS to make it better. I sarcastically say ""unless you plan on bringing the sauce here, i don't see a way to make this better."" He decides hes going to do just that. (Um, WHAT? this is unheard of) He hangs up, after telling me he's going to make another kids meal and sauce, and says he will call when he's on his way. He calls, tells me he found a driver and that hes on his way. While we are on the phone, driver knocks on the door. Never. Never, ever. Never, ever, ever had customer service quite this incredible and accommodating in my life. If you go, and you should, tell Edward he's amazing.

276,"7870 Monticello Ave Rancho Cucamonga, CA 91739",Chris S.,"Beaumont, CA",7/29/2016,1,"Overpriced, small portions and overall a pretty bad experience. Came here with a party of 6 during lunch time and walked in with high hopes. Nice decor, very modern and upbeat feel, hostess and servers were nice... Ordered our drinks and food from one server who we never saw again after getting our drinks and waited about 15 minutes until our ""official"" server came by and introduced himself. Our appetizers come out and  close to 30 more minutes go by and we flag our server down and ask him if he forgot about us.This is where it gets interesting... His response: ""Well I noticed you guys hardly touched your appetizers so I figured you were waiting on someone else to arrive."" Whoa, dude are you serious!? Unless the restaurant has some sort of high tech x Ray vision you're using in the back of the house we're not aware of (since you've been gone for 30 minutes unseen) how can you even make that assumption?  In 33 years it's one of the dumbest things I've ever heard a server say after a customer asks for their food. We all pretty much give him the same look and someone says politely, ""We haven't even received our soup yet;  can we at least get our soups please?"" Shortly after that our meals come out. Small portions, looks almost identical to their frozen T.V dinners in supermarkets on a fancy plate and taste like something you'd call bad Chinese food if you actually enjoy anything close in resemblance to authentic style Chinese. We ordered a chocolate cake which is the only star worth receiving in this review. Needless to say the server took his sweet time bringing that out and someone in our party finally had enough and made a complaint. Luckily they gave us a percentage off of our bill but what a terrible experience. After complaining and being there for a total of over 2 hours we even had to ask the server for our bill twice.

The noodles were cooked in a nice, light sauce and the dish would have been much better with ""nude"" prawns cooked the same way.I have always been a fan of PFs, but lately I feel they are missing the boat with their new dishes being not as healthy nor full of flavor and portions seem to be decreasing as the price is going up.  Not a good combination.",91739

My girlfriend and I met her friend and husband for happy hour at Pf Chang's. I was impressed immediately by the prices. There were about six dishes which were appetizer items that were beyond delicious. I ordered Dim Sum pork and shrimp which was awesome. Similarly priced was the spicy tuna roll and chicken wrap dishes. I had chicken with the wraps and topped it off with a few Agave margaritas. There were four of us and the price was more than fair.  The regular price for a meal like this for four would have easily been double the bill. The waiter was great. All in all happy hour at Pf Chang's was a treat. The happy hour treat extends to any area of the restaurant that a patron wishes to sit. This will by my favorite place to go. I honestly hate the fact that nine times out of ten I feel restaurants disappoint in regard to quality of food.

294,"7870 Monticello Ave Rancho Cucamonga, CA 91739",Priscilla C.,"Fontana, CA",3/25/2016,1,"What a disappointment. But I should have known better, I am Asian after all. My husband and I were curious to know what an Americanized franchise like PF Changs had to offer. The answer is, not much. You can get the same food at a hole in the wall restaurant in Monterey Park or your local China Town for half the price. We spent a total of $89 for standard dumplings, wontons, chow mein, Mongolian beef, lemon pepper shrimp and fried banana egg rolls with ice cream. The only difference I noticed between the food here and your local Panda Express is the amount of oil used; the food here isn't greasy which is something we can all appreciate but also expect from a restaurant. What upset me about my experience here was the service. Granted we came at 9pm on a Thursday (a slow day for restaurants) I did not expect to be rushed through my dinner. The server explained to us that our dessert may come in the middle of our meal because the kitchen is closing soon; she thought this was being courteous.However, from my own experience working at a fine dining facility, the kitchen and the server would stay well beyond closing hours to ensure that the guest who is paying good money would receive the same standard of food that one would recieve during regular business hours. Indeed, the dessert came to our table before the end of our meal and our server who was nice, told us we should ""hurry up and eat it before the ice cream melts."" Well, given the amount of time we let it sit there plus the plate being noticeably warm (freshly washed) it didn't take too long for the ice cream to melt. Needless to say, the mediocre food topped by the rush to eat it ensures that we won't be coming back for this bullshit. I don't know how this chain survives...have you people ever tried real Chinese/Asian food?  I guess we can say we ate at PF Changs now...but we're definitely not coming back.",91739

Mindy was our server and she did an awesome job, I cannot describe how accommodating she was, being that it was practically closing and she still had a smile on her face, I mean if it were me and I had to help people after closing I would not have been as friendly as she was.

296,"7870 Monticello Ave Rancho Cucamonga, CA 91739",Zerlina K.,"Covina, CA",6/24/2014,4,"So here the story about PF Chang. I'm simply not a fan in sense that I think this place is way overpriced Americanized Chinese food (fusion). But I had to give it another try since my fiance has never had it and we didn't know what we wanted for dinner. I had PF Chang in NC for a company event and it wasn't bad and paid for then.Despite I still think it ridiculous expensive for chinese fusion food and that it isn't fine dining the food isn't bad. If your OK acknowledging that this is expensive and not really authentic chinese food that it actually good. Plus, chinese food is mainly oil anyways...xPSo the food:You must try to lettuce wrap (veg style or meat). It is popular and it is good. It taste even better with the sauce that they mix for you. I think the sauce is just a good old mustard and soy sauce mixture. It was either really good or just the thought that your paying for it make your taste bud want to accept it is just that good. Anyways, a must get.We had the sea bass. All I can say is if you like sea bass then you will like it. But, it not cooked in any special sauce that you would expect for ""fusion"". Just the regular soy sauce pork chop taste if you know what I mean. The sea bass being one of my favorite fish was good. The spinach was OILY. I didn't eat it.Lastly, I had the banana coconut dessert. It was eh... after it came out I wished I had order something else. The fried banana was literally just banana fried so no technical good stuff there. If you like fried banana and ice cream then that is exactly what it is.",91739

I got to the restaurant in 20 minutes, gave them my name, and let them know I was early to pick up a call in order.   ""I don't see you in the system"", ""Could it be under a different name?"" , ""Did you call or use the internet"" , ""Could it be under a different name?"" (again).  When my order was finally located it had not even been started and needed a manager  to release it to the kitchen early (""future order""?).   I waited an additional 20 minutes, drive home and ate a tasty meal, but not worth the process it took to wrestle from the restaurant.",91739

My boyfriend and I were in the area and saw they had pretty good reviews as well as an assortment of Chinese food and Sushi rolls. We ordered 2 limeade refreshers, 4 vegetable spring rolls, a side dish of Brussel Sprouts, a side order of Long Life Noodles and 2 orders of avocado rolls. With tip our bill came out to $70! We did not leave feeling satisfied at all. If we spend that much money on that limited amount of food you'd expect it to be superb, not mediocre. The avocado rolls were basically missing avocado and were drenched in vinegar (came out to $22 alone). My favorite part of the meal was the limeade before dinner was served. If you want good rolls, go to kabuki, where you leave feeling full and half the price of this place. If you want great Chinese food, go to Panda Inn located in Pasadena.

He said he will be serving us. That part was fine. The meal we ordered was Surf Turf and Mongolian beef. Beef was overcooked and mushrooms were burnt. Surf Turf.. there was a bone in there and I bit it so hard that I thought my gum filling came off. I rather eat at fast food than paying $70 for 2 meals that wasn't even cooked right and those weren't supposed to be that hard to cook to star with.

He is very arrogant. He was very short with us. I already knew what I wanted but my friend wasn't too familiar with the menu so she had asked for a couple of recommendations. First of all he sighed out loud in front of us and began to tell her with a short tempered attitude and rushing like we were supposed to quickly order. My friend also wanted to ask about a soup but she felt burdened to even do so. Second we chose a couple that he recommended BUT it was nasty. I didn't even want to eat it. We asked for some sauce and it took a long time. My friend saw him standing with the sauce in his hand but laughing and talking to someone. When he came back, he only brought one sauce and the plate was dirty. He also never checked on us not once. The only time he came to our table was at the end of the meal to take out the plates and give us our check (didn't even bother to ask if we wanted it split). Our server had attitude, was very arrogant, anxious, and rude. Overall I give this a one star review. I used to love eating here but the quality and service went down.

So they ended up just eating the meat we ordered with the white rice . Then to top it off at the end before we payed I let him know I was apart of the rewards and write him my ID # he was still being rude about that I then payed but waited for my receipt with my change so I could update my rewards but he never came back until he seen I was still there an asked me if I wanted my change at this point I was very shocked because I never said for him to keep my change!

Chang's and will probably be my last unless someone else is picking up the tab.,91739
342,"7870 Monticello Ave Rancho Cucamonga, CA 91739",Arlene C.,"Corona, CA",5/2/2017,1,"Went here on Sunday at 12:30pm with my husband my 2 babies and a girl friend with her husband. I was greeted my the hostess, Marissa, very rude and short with her attitude. I had a double stroller, the Britax agile, fits through a single door. We asked for our table. She could not sit us any where in the dining room because of my stroller. She went as far as to tell me to leave my stroller with my 2 kids in the reception area. I said no way! So then I said, what about the patio, she said your stroller won't fit. I said yes it will, it fits through 1 door. She kept saying no, that it would block the path way. So my husband's​ friend suggested to lift it over the patio door she said no. I kept telling her, my stroller fits. So then she said fine, you wanna try. I said yes. It fit perfectly! She was so rude when talking to me, she told me, you need to be on this side, where she was standing, I told her, I understand but I'm waiting for you to move so I can move my stroller to your side. She was blocking me because she had to door open. My husband told her, you don't have kids, do you, she says, no! I'm only 22. I was like are you kidding me! How dare you, discriminate me for having my kids with me and being a young mom! My kids were both asleep sweating in the stroller because we were in the outside patio and it was midday and pretty hot. We asked our waitress the name of the hostess, she came back and gave us the name. We ordered. My friend ordered a sushi roll, it comes with shaved ginger, well, it was practically non existent. She ordered additional ginger, the server brings her like literally a shaving of it. Then my husband asked the waitress for a side of ginger. I mean c'mon, if you need to charge additional, just say it, we can pay it. I ordered food for my older son, just in case he would wake up. We cut the whole lunch short because it was hot out and I was bothered by the way I was treated, denied seating in the main dining room and actually pretty much every where. I asked the waitress to boxed my son's food. It was  chicken fried rice with a side of fresh fruit. We left through the side gate. As I was pushing my stroller with my 2 kids still in it, it kept bugging so I asked my Husband to take the kids and I was go back inside and speak to the manager. I asked the rude hostess to please call her manager. She did and disappeared after that. I pulled the manager aside because I did not want to make a sense but I explained the whole situation. How humiliated and embarrassed I was and that I had never been discriminated against for being a mom with my two kids let alone being young. I told him my stroller was ADA compliant and it fit every where a wheelchair would. That I wanted to see the hostess refuse to serve a disabled person in a wheelchair because it would block the pathway. Or treat another young mom with her children the way she treated me. He apologized for her and offered to refund my bill but instead only gave me 2 $50 that was not even the price of my bill. I came home, my son asked for his food, I pull it out of the box to find out the waitress boxed the fruit directly on top of the chicken Fried rice. I paid for garbage on top of it all! I was even more mad at that point. So I decided to contact corporate and explain to them what happened and that I wanted them to rectify my experience. I am sure pf Chang's doesn't train their employees to discriminate nor to ruin their leftovers, mind you,y son had not even touched it. I am waiting for corporate to contact me before I seek a lawyers advice. HORRIBLE experience.",91739
343,"7870 Monticello Ave Rancho Cucamonga, CA 91739",Linda M.,"Hesperia, CA",11/21/2017,5,"I've been to several PF Chang's restaurants over the years and although it's never a disappointment, not all PF Chang's have the same quality in their food. The 1st one I went to is the one in Las Vegas on Paradise Rd. All of the menu items at this location were so good that it set the bar for all the subsequent locations thereafter (Planet Hollywood location, Rampart Rd. location, San Diego). I'm happy to say that this R.C. location was on par with our 1st experience at the L.V restaurant! I truly think the star of their menu has always & will always be their Chicken Lettuce Wraps, which is a ""go-to"" menu item that never fails to deliver on taste & value. Next time you're visiting this place, say Hey! to their fabulous hostess Judy, who's a little ray of sunshine welcoming you into this fine establishment.",91739
344,"7870 Monticello Ave Rancho Cucamonga, CA 91739",Xavier C. C.,"Los Angeles, CA",6/23/2014,4,"YUM!  We are regulars at PF Chang's because it never disappoints. My wife and kids took me for a Father's Day celebration last Sunday. As usual, we made reservations, but on this particular evening it didn't seem like they were needed. It wasn't slammed--although I would still encourage them. This location seems to always be busy.Sean was our server, and while initially his service was off a few beats, he caught up. We always start off with the Vegetarian Lettuce Wraps and tried the Handmade Dumplings for the first time. They  were tasty with drizzled with as avory  light chili sauce. If you are dining with a few people, I highly recommend the FOUR-COURSE PRIX-FIXE MENU for  $39.95; the two entrées basically make up the cost, but you get three additional courses. The dessert is perhaps the only very small portion of this selection, but the price is till reasonable.On this visit, I had the Kung Pao Mussels, which were very tasty, but then again, I like very spicy. I had Japanese beer with my meal and my wife had her usual Asian Pear Mojito (which she loves). The only request that I always have to make is regarding the timing of the food. We prefer not to have our courses paced, so that the following course doesn't come out while still enjoying previous one. It could be a product of wanting to turn tables, but other than that, PF Chang's gets it right. Sweet, salty and savory.",91739
345,"7870 Monticello Ave Rancho Cucamonga, CA 91739",Chris L.,"Sparks, NV",5/24/2019,1,"Service was bad. I needed some boxes the waiter passed by a couple times walked right past my wave. I had to call the front desk for some boxes. I think overall their quality has gone down. Both time I went bc someone else wanted to come. Chicken lettuce wrap was good. Better than the one in Anaheim. Pad Thai salty and noddle dry and hard. My friend had curry, not good either. Another friend had the tofu vegetarian dish which was ok. next time someone wants to go, I would put my foot down and say NO.",91739

No offer of drinks or anything until we asked for a manager. Then when the food came out it was not as good as usual.  Steak was very chewy and the honey crispy shrimp was all breading. Haven't been there in awhile. Hopefully this was a one time deal for them. At their prices they need to maintain better service and quality.,91739

I went with a party of 12 and they have all proclaimed that the mongolian beef was WAY TOO salty. Padtai was bland. Calamari had salt&pepper as the side dipping.. ""sauce""? (..Why would they do that..) & the fried rice just tastes like the cook accidently spilled too much soysauce in it.. Everything was just so mediocre or outright not worth the time & money. Let's be real people. I would most likely enjoy Panda Express more for a fraction of the price..The service wasn't so bad though and our waiter was quite friendly, but I'm sorry because that's just not enough to bring me back..",91739

We started out with the shrimp, that was wonderful; not too spicy but full of flavor. Then we got our soup. There was a bit of a snag with our soup since it was brought out cold and the wonton was hard. Our server quickly took care of our problem and gave us a new dish within minutes. The manager was informed and was wondering if we were okay with everything, which we were, and told us if we need anything, do not hesitate to inform any of the staff.

354,"7870 Monticello Ave Rancho Cucamonga, CA 91739",Jade W.,"Las Vegas, NV",1/30/2015,3,"My parents like to eat at chains unlike me, but I indulge them when I'm visiting them. We started with the chicken lettuce cups. It was decent, but pretty standard. One of my annoyances with lettuce cups is when they give you lettuce leaves that are drenched in water. I asked for some paper napkins to pat them dry. Crispy Honey chicken was my favorite as a kid and is still my guilty pleasure with a lot of hot mustard. Beef chef special tossed with some potato, asparagus, etc tossed in a citrusy sauce. It was slightly over salted, but the idea was good.spicy green beans side was pretty decent. Lots of garlic and chili sauce tossed onto them.Chow mein noodles were super standard fare. My problem isn't that it's not ""authentic"" cuisine as there is a time and place for the Americanized stuff and at times, fried stuff tossed in a sweet sauce of some sort actually hits a comfort spot. My issue that like with all chains, the food never seems to be a good deal for what you're getting. The beef dish was $18 a dish and that's the type of prices I can expect where I'm from, Las Vegas, in our tourist area. The food does taste better than some other chains that just taste microwaved, but it's not at the caliber of what they charge. However, you know what to expect and it generally never differentiates which seems to be why people love this place. For me, I'll only go when my parents want to, otherwise I live fine without it in Vegas even though there are several in town.",91739

He put us on the cold ahead list so you wouldn't have long to wait once we got there. They were very busy and had a lot of people waiting to be seated. Our server was Nicole. We could not have asked for a better server. We asked about appetizers and was told what the most popular items were an answered all our questions. She had a lot of people she was taking care of but if you didn't look to see who all she was helping you would've never known because she was always coming to check to see if everything was OK or if we needed anything else. She kept our ice teas full and had a wonderful personality.  N Nicole was very personable and you're great at what she does. I have stomach problems and it's very hard for me to find a place that I can eat and not cause problems for me. I was very happy that everything we had was extremely tasty.

It's much more worth your price to order separately.   The ""appetizer"" was one egg roll each, although they did cut it in half to fill up the plate.   The soup was good (hot and sour, and wonton).  Both the appetizer and the soup were served promptly and were hot.   Unfortunately, it then took over a half an hour to get our entrees.  We sat and watched several people who ordered after us get their food delivered until finally our waiter came and claimed ""the kitchen got backed up"" and our food was on its way out.   Strange how the kitchen was backed up on our order, but people who arrived and ordered after us were getting their food without delay.   It took another five minutes for the food that was ""on its way out"" to actually arrive, and it had obviously been sitting under heat lamps for quite some time.   It was most certainly NOT fresh.  My husband ordered Chang's Spicy Chicken.   It isn't remotely spicy.   It was cut into cubes and had the oddest texture while remaining totally flavorless.  I kept sniffing at it to see if it was fish, because it did not have a chicken texture at all.   The sauce was good, but no one would ever categorize it as spicy.   I ordered Sweet and Sour Chicken.   It was decent, but they used a LOT of veggies and pineapple as filler, with very little chicken (in fact, three pieces of ""chicken"" were nothing more than fried breading with no chicken inside).   I'm assuming the portions were scaled down because we ordered the four course meal, because I can't imagine anyone really pays $13 for the portion sizes we received.   We were then informed that the dessert normally included wasn't available (shouldn't that have been brought up when we ordered?) and offered another dessert.  It was a berry ginger spongecake.   Again, very small portion, particularly for one that's meant to be shared.   Very bland, with the only real flavor being in the berries themselves.     Looking at the menu and the example of the dessert that we were supposed to get (banana spring rolls), the replacement dessert appears to be less than half the size, and we were totally ripped off.We originally planned to eat dinner and walk around the mall before seeing a movie.  Thanks to how long it took for both our entrees to arrive and the check to be delivered and processed, we ended up having to rush over to our movie.   We have no plans to ever try PF Chang's again.

We usually eat here because other people want to so it's not something we seek out. The food is good quality so you feel better about going off on Orange Chicken, Honey Shrimp, and everything else because you know it's actually chicken and such. Look, I make no accusations but I've eaten at my share of hole in the wall Chinese joints where I'm questioning the ""chicken"". If it's not chicken, just keep it real and tell me I'm eating Kung Pao Possum. We ordered the chicken fried rice and quite honestly, the version I make is better. This tasted like regular steamed rice that they added soy sauce and chicken to. It didn't have that great fried flavor. We also ordered the salt and pepper calamari, which was pretty good. I, however, was slightly disappointed in their version of Sriracha. Not really hot and kinda sweet.The service was ok. Someone in our party told the server it was his wife's birthday and the server must have thought that was just trivia because he promptly brought the check and that was all she wrote.",91739

We ordered the Ahi Tartar, which was so delicious that we actually ordered two! So fresh and we loved the shape of the wontons! The Spicy Shrimp with sriracha aioli was so flavorful and spicy ! The batter wasn't at all greasy. We cleaned the plate and we were going to order a second one ( i know, I know, we LOVE to eat!) The Northern style short ribs were very tender and the spice rub was delicious! It went really well with the three sauces that the server mixes for you at your table! My boyfriend loved his Moscow Mule. It didn't come in the traditional cup but was still tasty.  My Margarita on the other hand tasted like it had way way too much sweet and sour mix in it! It was not fresh and I stuck with water after my first one. Ooops! almost forgot! the Sweet Treats section of the dessert menu is awesome!! Perfect size little cakes! The tiramisu was perfect !

412,"7870 Monticello Ave Rancho Cucamonga, CA 91739",Eric O.,"Laguna Beach, CA",10/15/2014,5,"I had a really bad experience at a previous P.F. Chang's a few weeks ago, but I had a gift card, and decided to take my parents out for dinner. We chose to go to this location to avoid going back to the location where I had such a bad experience.My father had called ahead of time and made a reservation, so we had less than a 5 minute wait once we arrived. We were sat by a friendly hostess, and offered chopsticks. My parents declined, but I took a pair. When in Rome, right?Our server was Salvadore (Sal) and he was spot on wonderful. Service was excellent, his demeanor was very friendly, and though we waited a bit long for dinner, he apologized profusely for it, and always made sure we had plenty of rice (both brown and white), and our drinks were refilled. To start the night off, I asked for a glass of Ty Ku Coconut Sake (chilled). This has become my new go-to for sake, and it is so crisp and refreshing. My dad tried a sip, and even he liked it. For appetizers, we had the Spicy Tuna Roll (for me), Pork Gyoza (dumplings) - for my father and I to share, and Vegetable Spring Rolls (for my Mom). All of them were delicious - my Mom even let me have half a Spring Roll. I was happy my father was willing to try a piece of the tuna roll - he is not a big seafood fan. Both my mother and I had one of their new seasonal entrees, while my father had one of their classic menu items.My mother had the Cantonese Lemon Chicken with brown rice, and while it looked delicious (according to her it was), she did comment the chicken breast seemed a bit small. That said, presentation was excellent.My father had the Sweet and Sour pork with brown rice. I tried a piece, and really liked it. The sauce was not overly sweet, which is one of my pet peeves. I settled on the Korean BBQ chicken with white rice, and it was wonderful: sweet & spicy red chili sauce with fresh red peppers, onions and green beans, topped with a cool, refreshing kimchi slaw.First thing I noticed was just how VIBRANT the food looked. I know that may sound weird, but seriously, it just LOOKED fantastic. The red of the peppers, and the orange of the chicken, the yellow of the onions, and the green of the green beans just popped out from the plate. (ProTip: restaurants use bright white plates to make the colors of their food 'pop'). Everything was glazed with a sauce, which only added to the aesthetics giving everything a glossy finish.The chicken is wok-friend in oil giving each piece a crunchy exterior, despite being coated in sauce. While each bite starts sweet, there is enough heat to leave the back of your throat burning relatively quickly. A perfect combination of sweet and heat! As I mentioned earlier, dinner took a bit to come out, HOWEVER, my parents and I all agreed we didn't mind. It was nice to have a slower-paced dinner, and to allow us to talk, and enjoy our appetizers without feeling rushed. In no way am I faulting the restaurant for this in my review. When Sal came out with our food, he indicated the cooks had made the wrong dish for me, and that is why it was taking so long, as they were making my dinner. A few moments later, a manager brought my dish to the table.The ONLY negative thing is the brown rice seemed lukewarm when brought to the table. However, once we mixed it with our entree, the heat from our entree seemed to warm up the rice. Of course, I'm sure it isn't supposed to work like that. After a bit, I asked for fresh brown rice, which Sal immediately brought out to us. That rice was warm, to his credit.Understandably, we were quite full from our dinner, but no good dinner is complete without dessert. All of the desserts on the menu looked amazing, but we settled on the Salted Caramel Cake and the Chocolate Peanut Butter Crunch. Each dessert was $2.95. The desserts were not large, but they were not two-bite tiny desserts either. They were ample enough to allow the three of us to share them having multiple bites each. While I thought the Salted Caramel Cake would be the hit (my mother is a huge fan of salted caramel), the Chocolate Peanut Butter Crunch cake was the favorite. One word: decadent. Oh. My. Goodness. I would go back JUST for the dessert, and it would be worth it.The entire evening was a success, and a far cry from what I experienced on my previous encounter (albeit a different PF Changs). Service was wonderful, staff was friendly, and the food was delicious.Do yourself a favor, and head over to P.F. Chang's today for some great food!",91739

I am on a GF diet and they have a whole GF menu. This is why I continue to come. They even label the food Gluten Free so you can't screw up and eat the wrong thing. - Nice atmosphere if you dine in- At times the food is amazingly good (except the times that it isn't)- Dining there is actually decent service most of the time. Cons:-  Sometimes the food is not very good. They definitely have some good chefs and some bad chefs. I usually order the GF Chang's spicy chicken and sometimes it is amazingly good, sometimes it is mushy and gross, and last time they forgot to put any red pepper in it, which was gross. If it hadn't been take out I would've gone back and demanded my money back. -Take out experience is ALWAYS bad. They always forget something or screw something up and it takes SO LONG to get your food even if you come in after the time that tell you your food will be ready over the phone.

Chang's food has been beaten to the ground, so let me just touch on some of my other observations about this place.  Yes, it's located in Victoria Gardens, which means if you are trying to eat here after 5 p.m. on either a Friday or Saturday night, you will be waiting a while, just like at every other restaurant here.I came here on a Saturday night at 6 p.m., and surprisingly, the wait was only 45 minutes, which was surprising.  Even more surprising was the fact that our table was indeed ready in 45 minutes.  In terms of ambiance, I wasn't sure what to make of the whole black and red motif.  I guess it was kind of cool, on the other hand, if you threw in some brimstone and some open flames, it would feel like dining in Dante's Inferno.  The place was rather noisy, so it didn't lend itself well to having intimate or non-shouting dinner conversation.Our food was served a lot more quickly that I was expecting, which was nice.  The food was better than I was expecting, but the portions were small relative the price being charged, at an average of $12 per entree.  For $12, it better be curl-my-toes good, but it wasn't.  Anyways, at least I can now say I've eaten at P.F.

The table was dirty and sticky with rice on it. Wiped it with a napkin and let it go.  The kung pao chicken had absolutely no flavor, chicken fried rice was slightly better but not much. Service was mediocre, I don't normally complain about service but our server Jacob would just disappear for ten minutes at a time, leaving my boyfriends drink empty for lengthy amounts of time.  He didn't seem too happy to get ""kids"" but what server ever does, we still left him over 20% but that's just because I was raised to leave at least a 20% tip.  As we're walking out the door the hostesses standing there ignored us, yet again.

The spicy chicken was good but not really spicy. The beef was tender but slightly too sweet. The green beans are fantastic and I highly recommend. The dipping sauce is amazing.

Beef and shrimp were the best out of the four...the orange chicken was dry and the almond/cashew chicken had no flavor.Chicken lettuce wraps and drinks came out fast, as well as our dinner.  But, while we were in the middle of eating the main meal, we realized we never got the dumplings, so we reminded our waitress (after we flagged her down) and they were brought out. They were not good as they were doughy and could tell they were under the heat lamp for a while. And now thinking about it, we never got our soup!  The waitress did take the dumplings off our bill.Desserts were good (tiramisu, chocolate torte, and blueberry cheesecake).I don't think I'll be coming back to PF Chang's for a while...not a great experience and food was eh...",91739

Her name was Melanie, she was very sweet and pleasant from the time she first approached our table. Through out our meal she checked on us and attended to all of our needs. As a group we eat out often and we all agreed that she definitely provided us with the best service which was an asset to our dining experience.

We have never been to this location, even though we live so close, because of the crowds, and lackluster experiences at other locations. This visit was about on-par or below our previous not so great experiences. The first thing is: this location gets packed! We always see crowds around the front doors on the weekend, but we met earlier at 5 pm with a party of 6 and still waited an hour! Going to eat early apparently doesn't help with the wait! The service was somewhat slow, but we were also enjoying each other's company so we didn't rush either; by the time we left it was 8 pm and the lobby was so packed that you had to push through to get out the front door. The food was ok, but not great. Each couple did the $40 dinner for two and my wife and I had the crispy honey chicken and the Mongolian beef. Our salt and pepper calamari appetizer was good, nice and crispy and not chewy. The honey chicken was very good, but the Mongolian beef was so dry and overcooked. It was like beef jerky pieces, the meat was so tough. I definitely would not recommend it or order it again.I think I remember why we don't care too much for P.F. Chang's now. It was a good atmosphere to sit and catch up with friends, but food wise and with the wait, we won't be coming back for dinner anytime soon.",91739

My server/the bartender Ryan brought out all of my food in a timely manner and even brought out some extra cherries for my shirley temple. We got the Mongolian beef and the ginger chicken, both excellent! I ordered the chocolate dome at the end for the first time, it wasn't my cup of tea, and they took it off my bill no problem. I didn't enjoy it (not that anything was wrong, I just couldnt handle the decadence) so they didn't make me pay.

I've eaten here a few times now and the service in the dining room isn't all that great, it has an unfounded stuck up, snobbish atmosphere. The food usually takes forever to come out, and by the time you get it, it's cold. Friends of mine invited me to the happy hour here one night, and I was apprehensive because of my early experiences, so glad I went. The bar area was a complete 180 from what was going on in the dining room. The service was great; the food came out in a timely manner and was nice and hot. If you like spicy, I recommend the Flaming Red Wontons, they have a great burn. The drink menu is very well priced and they have a great selection of beer, wine and hard alcohol. The only problem with the bar is it isn't designed for a lot of people; I would only come here with a party of four at the most.  So if you're in the mood for a sit down Chinese dinner, then I would pass this place by, but if you want to sit and hang out for a happy hour and snack on food, then I would recommend the bar area.",91739

She told me it would be a half hour wait for a booth! I looked at 5 empty booths around us and asked, ""Really?"" She smiled and nodded yes so, my daughter and I sat at a table. Not only was the table greasy, it was wet. Pretty gross. I wiped everything down with my napkin. The server took her time getting our drink order so by the time she got to us, we were ready to order. The wait time for our food was decent, we ordered 3 sushi rolls and lettuce wraps. The food was okay, not bad but not phenomenal either.

Grown in Ca. 2) killed,Frozen, shipped to some third world country. 4)Thawed 5) Re-frozen, and re-shipped back to beautiful So Cal. Hastily prepared and tossed on to a plate. It tasted 4 months old.

Good lean meats, fresh veggies and seafood.

I've never been to a PF's before so yes, I was a virgin per se.  I was a virgin mainly due to preconceived notions I built up mainly due to other's experiences. These preconceived notions were that PF's food was just over-Americanized, over-priced, and overrated. I was invited here and I wasn't going to say no, that'd be rude! Plus, I saw this as an opportunity to prove those notions wrong. In our modern society, aren't we supposed be more open minded and get over our preconceived notions? So I gave this place the benefit of the doubt.The interior of the restaurant was nice but noise level was high which made conversation a bit difficult to maintain. Service was prompt and friendly though the food was a bit of a wait.  We ordered three dishes: Shrimp fried rice, chicken lo mein, and pepper steak. One thing you notice immediately are the smallish portions. The shrimp fried rice was alright but I've definitely had better. The chicken lo mein (along with the oolong tea) I felt was the highlight of the meal. The pepper steak I could've skipped, the thick sauce lacked pepper flavor and mostly tasted like thick soy sauce. Let's go over my checklist again.Americanized? A bit obvious if you're here right?... Overpriced? Hell Yes! Entrees can range $9-$20 which isn't worth the portions they give you. Overrated? ""F"" expletive yes! For Americanized Chinese food, I'd hit up the Panda Inn a couple miles down the fwy off the 10. Better food, a bit more in portions, and prices are a tad cheaper.",91739

Sadly, those are now flavorless and instead of yummy butter lettuce, it was served with a nasty wedge of iceberg lettuce, which was wet. They no longer have crab fried rice or Shanghai cucumber and the waiter said, ""The cucumbers have been replaced with Tempura cauliflower."" Uh, those aren't even remotely the same thing. We ended up ordering the street noodles and some hot crispy beef dish. The beef was like jerky and not spicy let alone hot and the veggies were warm but not cooked. The noodles we're supposed to have curry and roasted veggies with chicken and shrimp. Lots of shrimp but the chicken was WAY over cooked, I could not taste curry AT ALL, and the roasted veggies, which consisted of a few green onion stalks, a ton of cherry tomatoes, and celery were also barely warm and not roasted by any stretch of the imagination. This could have something to do with the fact that while it took 45 minutes to get seated, it only took 20 minutes for us to finish our entire meal as food was out to us within minutes of ordering. Portions are not what they used to be either, there is no way their new portions are family style portions and I'm not a big eater. The service was ok but hurried and one hostess (not the sweetheart that sat us) was straight up rude and needs to keep her nasty attitude in check before someone hits her. I'll miss the old P.F.

When our food was delivered I asked for the 3 sauces that normally come with food at PF changs, instead of just bringing them to me the bartender decided to tell me they don't do the ""presentation"" at the bar, and asked which exact sauce I wanted. I told him all three and he did not need to ""present"" them to just out them on an appetizer plate. He again said we don't ""present"" them at the bar. I finally just said forget it, and he finally walked three steps over to the squeeze bottles with sauce put them on a appetizer plate and ""presented"" them.

Man he personally made sure I was taken care of. He and the staff did a great job! Let me explain. I called and made reservations for 3 at 6:30pm the day before I arrived (mind you that's when a dinner rush would start). I requested I bring in presents, a cake, and flowers 2 hours before we'd come in to eat, they happily accommodated. It was for my Girlfriends birthday. So the day of around 2:00pm I called and wanted to add one more person and requested that it was in a booth seating area , they happily accommodated. Then I called in at 5:00pm and requested that we push the time to come in to 7:30pm and I wanted to add 2 more people so a total of 6, and still wanted a booth. Once again they happily accommodated. I came in at 7:00pm (late) to help set up for the Birthday Girl, and there was a party of 20 already finished with there food but dragging on the night at our reserved seating. So the the manager Karim Gonzalez quickly took action, and found us another table. I understand that I've been difficult to deal with at this point, but I still went on to say that I was unhappy with our new seating arrangement. He then told me that as soon as the people eating there left he would make sure that I have the seating arrangement that I requested earlier. Then my girlfriend pulled up, with all of the people that were coming to her birthday dinner. So I kind of started panicking I went outside to greet them and by the time I came back, not only were the group of 20 people gone from the table, but the table was already clean the flowers are on the table and the presents were displayed as well. I couldn't have been happier and neither could my girlfriend so thank you very much. BTW the food is great too!!!!",91739

We ordered chicken fried rice, shrimp fried rice, and garlic noodles with shrimp. I have had great fried rice at Thai restaurants but P.F. Changs fried rice was AMAZING!  They used jasmine rice (I believe) instead of regular rice, it was very flavorful, and the portion size was enough for two people. The appetizer we ordered was a lot like spinach dip, but it was kale,  nonfat yogurt, and quinoa served with wonton chips. I could have ate the wonton chips by themselves because they were so good. The kale and non-fat yogurt mixture was different; but I have to say it was very very healthy. The one reason why we decided to eat here was because we are trying to eat healthier. So if you want good healthy food this is the place for you. I also noticed that they had different types of sushi. I for one, like California rolls and they had them. So now I have to go back because I want to try their California rolls. With everything we ordered and drinks our bill came up to $44 so I think we made out pretty good.",91739

There has not been one time where I had a negative dining experience there! My favorite Server  is Fernando! He is super awesome and always has a smile on! He never makes us feel like we're a burden for him! always has a smile on and carries on a good conversation. Although he is super busy, he never let's us feel like our table is not important. Fernando ALWAYS checks on us and he is just a fabulous server over all! If you want delicious food and excellent service, P.F. Chang's in Rancho Cucamonga is the place to go.

Years ago, I had been to this and other PF Chang's locations and thought the food was good but it was never enough to keep me coming back. Recently, my husband suggested we try it again for a weekday lunch date and I'm so glad he did. I don't know if the menu has changed that much in the years but the quality of the food seemed significantly better. The lunch menu pricing is pretty good and you get plenty of food and it's delicious (I even ended up taking some home). The service was noticeably superior to most competitors in the area with everyone, from the manager to our waiter to the busser, brought their ""A"" game. They were friendly, efficient, and accurate. They also seem to be extremely concerned with food allergies and sensitivities, far more than any other restaurant I've ever been to. Today, we went there for lunch again (this time with the kids, no date) and the food and service were equally stellar and it only cost $38 (before tip) for our two lunch entrees, two kids entrees, and drinks. Not bad at all. I definitely look forward to going back.",91739

So we walked in, but were a little dismayed about the long waiting time since it was a sunday night around 6 pm. However, we decided to stay since there had to be a reason why people are sticking around to wait. After about a 40 minute wait, we were seated and after ordering, it was another 30 minute wait. They are slow.I got the honey crispy chicken which was okay at best and my chinese friend said the kung pao chicken was mediocre. Overall, we thought this restaurant was overhyped and expensive. The amount of food you got for around 15 bucks was not impressive. The only reason why I was full at the end was because of the brown rice, which wasn't that appetizing either. We had better chinese food at other smaller restaurants. We might've been too harsh since we're both Asian (and the only ones at the restaurant), but if you want real Chinese go somewhere else. Like other the posted reviews, I agree it's another mainstream Americanized Chinese restaurant. A lot of people like it no doubt since they're willing to wait for it, but realize that the taste here is suited for Americans not for Asians or people who like authentic Chinese food.",91739

After what really didn't seem to be that long of a wait for our entrees, the owner of the establishment (sorry, I forgot his name) personally came up to us to explain the first try at our sea bass got scorched and the cooks were starting a new one. He graciously offered to get us a little bite while we waited and apologized for the delay. A little while longer passes and the owner comes over with our entrees, explains the sea bass we were receiving was actually the third (and successful) try, and that for the wait and trouble, he was comping our entrees. (Totally unnecessary because I don't feel we waited that long, but absolutely welcome!) My husband and I have waited extra long for our food at another popular establishment close by to this P.F. Chang's and had no such treatment. The owner here kept us informed all the way about what was going on with our order, made sure our entree was perfect, and ultimately comped the dishes to ensure we were happy customers. Pretty much the best customer service you could ask for. And the sea bass was delicious!!! Happy patrons here and we will definitely be returning.",91739

We ordered from the lunch specials they had since it was pretty budget friendly. Anyhoots, I ordered the glazed walnut & shrimp, and my friends got the mango chicken-or-whatever, and the chicken lettuce wraps. My glazed walnut & shrimp was pretty good, except for the melon pieces that were part of it. It seemed pretty random cause it didn't really seem to enhance the flavors or anything. :/ and don't EVEN get me started on their steamed white rice. It was dry and tasted old. I should've just brought my own rice from home! The other two dishes were also enjoyable, but same issue with the rice for the mango chicken. Overall though, for me the food failed to live up to the hype. The taste was pretty mediocre, nothing mind-boggling.

Why is VG so freaking crowded?!?!?! It's not Christmas... Oh gosh.....Anyways, we had to wait like an hour lol. My friend and I got the four course meal for $39.99, which came with your choice of soup (egg drop or sweet and sour), an appetizer, 2 entrees, choice of brown or white rice, and 2 mini desserts. The appetizer we got was the Dynamite Shrimp. Perfectly battered shrimp with a creamy and spicy sauce. It is topped on a bed of crispy vermicelli. I love getting Dynamite Shrimp... it is also offered in the Happy Hour menu (M-F 4 to something I believe).We got the crispy honey chicken and the mongolian beef. The honey chicken was okay... it was like sweet and sour chicken. The mongolian beef however was freaking delicious. That was probably the best mongolian beef I ever had. What I liked about it was that it was a little charred up, and the sweetness and saltiness was just right. I preferred the brown rice and it was very very good (first time too).My friend got the carrot cake and I got the tiramisu.

Started in the bar for a cocktail I did not catch the name of the bartender, but very attractive and a good listener. Smooth transition to the table we had reservations so wait was minimal. Our server was Michael he was respectful and attentive. We had several starters with the lettuce wraps, wonton soup , edamame, and  spicy shrimp the breading was crisp with a shirracha aioli on bed of crunchy red cabbage very nice. Dad ordered the Heirloom tomato salad, had avocado with a Thai Basil Ponzu dressing he didn't care for the dressing. I finished it off for him I think I'd back off a bit on the Thai Basil it was over powering the dish a bit. Basil can be that way some stronger than others. Chef,taste taste taste before you send it out. I ordered the Seared Ahi with wasabi guacamole. I couldn't taste much wasabi in the guacamole. It came with arugula and some nice green beans. There was some kind of sauce drizzled on the Ahi I couldn't make it out, it was slightly sweet, but irrelevant to the dish. Perhaps if the wasabi had been more prevalent in the dish the contrast of sweet and spice would have been there. I would prefer they omit the guacamole and maybe dress the arugula with something instead. The dish presents as a salad so dress the greens maybe try the avocado and wasabi combo as a dressing? Some of the other dishes we shared were the shaking beef, sweet and sour chicken, orange chicken, spicy stir fried asparagus. All very tasty and well prepared. All hot to the table and timed nicely between appetizer to entree. We had two deserts to share the vanilla wontons and banana spring rolls. Both were very good banana spring rolls think bananas foster only they serve it with a coconut pineapple ice cream. All in all a very pleasant experience.",91739

It has a great flavor, the shrimp is fresh, and it has a slight crispiness on the outside that gives it some kick. I make orgasm face when I eat this.

I was very upset that his meal was not complimentary we expected nothing more than just that one meal to be complementary due to the fact he stopped eating his meal once the bug was found the explanation that was given for not comping the meal was that the manager wasn't sure if the meal came with the bug in it or the bug flew into the food what difference should that make and why should we be at fault for the restaurant having bugs we will not return nor will our guest and we will make sure we tell everyone that we know what a shame for you PF Chang Rancho Cucamonga,91739

Sometimes, during busy service, it's hard to find your server, but you can always flag down another, although they might seem a little perturbed that you're keeping them from their own tables. The price of the food isn't bad, as long as you're with a group of people and you can share the bill.

One of them turned and asked if she can help me in such a rude way and I said table for 4 she took my info down and we waited outside. Came back to check in since are table was ready and same thing no interaction towards me until a few seconds after her conversation and asked if she can help. I told her I'm here to check in, now this next part is what really ticked me off, they all looked among each other and nobody was willing to walk me to my table, this girl (wish I got her name) had her purse like she was about to leave and they ask her if she can take me which she did.

PF Chang's why not we love their food so we parked and walked inside where the hostess sat us in their patio under one of their permanent heat lamps above! It was nice and warm! We ordered a few items and they came to us quickly! The lettuce wraps are always crisp and refreshing with just a little sauce on it! The rest of the dishes were also fresh and good but we just had to take same home. The servers were all friendly and attentive to anyone in the patio.,91709

722,"3445 Grand Ave Chino Hills, CA 91709",Paul M.,"Ontario, CA",10/29/2020,3,"We were in the mood for P.F. Chang's, so we decided to go to the Chino Hills location to check it out. It's located at a shopping center and in my opinion, parking should not be an issue. We arrived and was welcomed by the host. We waited for a few minutes for our table to be ready. Arriving there, we wanted to take advantage of the Happy Hour special they have. Our server, Ally,  approached us and took our order. We ordered: Chang's Chicken Lettuce Wraps, Crispy Honey Chicken (with additional Fried Rice on the side for $3.00) & combination Signature Lo Mein. Waited for a bit and the appetizer arrived. The Chicken Lettuce Wrap was very delicious, fresh & had flavor. Then the Honey Crispy Chicken arrived with the Side order of Fried Rice. The Honey Crispy Chicken was good and the Fried Rice complimented the dish well. As we were eating, we waiting for our final dish, Combination Signature Lo Mein to come. After15-20mins, we still didn't get our final plate. We asked Ally what was the status of our Combination Signature Lo Mein. She completely forgot to include the dish in our order. So we had to wait another couple of minutes until we received it. Please Note: the restaurant was not packed and there was plenty of time to check the status of our order. Also, our server did not ask for refills for our drinks, while we were dining; we had to ask for them. I'm a huge believer in providing great customer service, especially in a restaurant setting. My overall experience was disappointing. The food, we don't have any complaints; in fact it was delicious and prepared fresh. It's the customer service we received that made our experience disappointing. The fact that after we received our last dish, the final bill in my opinion should have been adjusted for the Combination Signature Lo Mein to be comped. As well as the drinks, we had to ask for them. In my personal opinion, I'm not sure I would recommend this P.F. Chang's location, but maybe for take out. Maybe if there was some conscience effort from the manager to approach us and ask how was our experience and would have adjusted the bill, I would feel differently.",91709
723,"3445 Grand Ave Chino Hills, CA 91709",Mary H.,"San Dimas, CA",5/14/2021,3,"We placed an online order to go at the Chino Hills location for 4 people. The order said it would be ready in 18 mins, so we arrived about 20 minutes after placing it. The host said they were running behind and told me it would be about 5-10 more minutes which was no big deal, so I checked back in 10 minutes later. They then told me it would be ANOTHER 10 minutes. Long story short, I ended up waiting over 30 extra minutes for our to-go order. By that time the hunger was really setting in for sure, not to mention my poor brother who was starved after his first flag football game. Word to the wise: don't order the chicken lettuce wraps because apparently they take an hour to make.I ended up asking to speak to the manager. When he came out, he had my order of food and took care of the cost for an entree. He was really nice about it, apologized, and explained that the kitchen couldn't keep up with all of the orders. When we finally got home to eat, the food was delicious and we were all happy. The to-go packing was also pretty good, minus the fact that they put my cold cocktail in a bag of ice on top of the hot food. However, I loved the fact that they actually put the pre-made cocktail in a bag of ice!I took one star off for the fact that they kept lying to me about the amount of time it would take, and another for the actual wait time.",91709

I placed an order for pick-up of 3 items and everything went very smoothly with that portion. I wasn't disappointed until I asked for some of the crispy chow mein noodles (garnish snack) and was told I needed to pay $6.49 for them if I wanted them that I got irritated and disappointed. Since when do you pay for something like that, that's not on the menu and is used as a garnish. Before I would pick up my order and they would give me some in  a little bag, now you want me to pay for them. I will pass. Never mind the fact that I order from them often for my office (large $500+ order) and they NEVER send the sauces that I add to the order. But not once have I said anything. Well I'm not being silent any longer. Get it together P.F. Chang's stop trying to charge for the garnish and when I place my company order and add the trio sauces to my order, make sure they are in the bag.",91709

A lot of the items are gone, no garlic noodles. Ok maybe I went back after a year, maybe that's why. The biggest disappointment was the lettuce wraps- there signature dish. It use to almost half a crispy lettuce with big bowl shaped leaves that you could make a wrap with. Instead we got barely 1/4 cut of a tiny iceberg lettuce...I was totally lost as to how do you make a wrap from that? I wish I had taken a picture. Ordered soup never got it. Told them to get a to go box for the extra lettuce wrap chicken ... never got it. Staff didn't even come to ask for second rounds of drink. So disappointed. This is not the old P F Chang's at all !",91709

We haven't been in a few years because we had service issues with this location in the past. They redeemed themselves with this visit. It was a Tuesday around 5pm and it was pretty empty and service was fabulous! Plus it was happy hour!We decided on the spring roll appetizer (happy hour special), Chang's spicy shrimp (off menu), Lo mein with chicken and Sesame chicken.  The spring rolls were good but lighter on the filling then we prefer. The shrimp is lightly fried with a spicy sweet sauce that is sooooo good. I loved all the veggies in the sesame chicken and the lo mein was very flavorful. Overall it was a good visit and we enjoyed our food. My husband is happy that we can put PF Chang's back in the dinning rotation.",91709

I took the plunge,  which prompted me to finally write a review.  Another IMPORTANT reason for this review is they are having a CONTEST with several new Lettuce Wrap flavors right NOW through August 19th.  YOU CAN VOTE AND HELP INFLUENCE a new item on the menu.  The contest is in three phases. The first phase was to submit new flavors/recipes (July).  The second phase is for the public to vote (through Aug 19).  Then the top three Finalists will compete in a cook-off in Las Vegas.   Here is the link:  pfchangs.promo.eprize.co…",91709

I have been here for both table service and curb side parking.  The shrimp dishes I fancy the most have been the shrimp with lobster sauce and the crispy honey shrimp.I usually just order curb side as of late, but they are usually on time and I would agree with some of the other reviewers that PF Chang's is a bit on the pricey side, but I still like the food enough to pay the extra bucks :)",91709

Chang's is one of our favorite restaurants, that is what we chose.  The food was supposed to arrive about 7:15 and when almost  1/2 hour had passed, I called my friend and she checked with the restaurant and was told it should be here shortly.  It was almost 9 p.m. when  it finally arrived.  The manager did refund part of the cost for my friend, which was nice.  Now, fast forward to last week.  We've had a death in the family, and the same friend wanted to order dinner for us to ease the pressure.  We thought last year's problem was probably a fluke, so we again chose P.F. Chang's.  Again, it was supposed to be here about 7:15 and again after waiting  1/2 hour, my friend called the restaurant and this time just cancelled the order and got credited.  The manager told her that the order got misplaced.  Although we are looking forward to dining there again as things are opening up, we will never again order delivery.",91709

My girlfriend had a P.F Chang's  gift card for the longest time and we decided to use it. When I first walked into the restaurant the setting possessed similar qualities to a murky movie theater. It put my girlfriend and I too sleep. I'm wondering if the employees there take vitamin D3 supplements. The setting is suboptimal for a romantic night, but not suitable for birthdays or parties in my opinion. I could hear yawns across each tables like we all took melatonin. I looked at the menu and I was surprised that this place had Asian fusion cuisine. I came here blind and immediately got excited to see what they had to offer. I checked if they served any curry or maybe some ramen. Sadly, they had none! I know I am greenhorn to asian fusion cuisine, so I don't know what is good or what to get. Luckily, my girlfriend is really experienced to P.F. Chang's and ordered for me. I do not recall all of them, but the lettuce wraps was only the memorable dish worth mentioning. Our waiter Chris aided in some of the dishes. His recommendations of some of the dishes were not really appealing. The spicy dragon sushi was pretty bland and the schezuapn  chicken was really dry. The best dish was the one my girlfriend picked. She only came here twice in her life and the waiter worked here for two years.  He also assumed that I was Chinese, but I did not take any offense. I said it's all good Asians look alike haha. After he said that, I looked around the place to see the audience. The place was filled for lunch which was surprising, but the most surprising part was that I could not see any other Asians than us  eating here. My girlfriend and I were the only Asians eating here. Before I told myself ""no wonder the food is not even that asian or good"" I asked my girlfriend if this was surprising to her as well and she told me that ""real"" Asians do not come here to dine because it's not ""really asian food"".  It was a decent experience, but I would not come back. I would not recommend this place to yelpers that live in the distance. This restaurant is just another pricey front thinking that they know how to cook asian food. I saw no fusion. I'm sorry for the people who actually think the food here is good too, but everyone is entitled to their opinions!",91709

I really believe this inferior food was prepared early and microwaved prior to pickup to try and make it appear fresh. (I placed my order 2 days prior).  The only dish that was worth eating was the side of ribs.  The Wonton soup was so overcooked that the wontons were pasty and lost all their texture..  The banana desert was a complete joke and the Asian donuts were, welll....a Duncan Donut would of been better.  Oh.....They totally forgot my daughters desert order of cheesecake.  In finale.... the food was well below standard.  I realize that due to the pandemic the same standard of food served might not be as good as take out... but the takeout I picked up and took home, on new years eve,  from this place was horrible. As you can see, My opinion on taste was not even the utmost concern, since that can be very subjective.  But, the quality, detail and preparation was SO below standard it ruined our family meal.  I spent almost 300$ and my order can be easily tracked.  We will see if management will follow up on this order and try to make things right!",91709

Mind you the guests sitting at the table next to us had gotten seated after we did and they got their drinks and their meal before we even got offered water. I hate to make this a racial thing but it almost felt that way. After we finally got someone to come serve us they brought out the drinks and the food quickly. The food was good.

An order of beef, orange chicken, soup, and chowmein. Close your eyes and imagine how much that would cost, at any Chinese restaurant. Did you imagine $63?  No?

The meat is slightly more tender and... well that's it. So if you're good with spending 4 times as much as your local Chinese food spots, go for it. But I still scratch my head over the $63.",91709

I Had the strongest craving for it last night so I decided to place a carry out order for after I picked up my groceries. Ordered at 5:30 and got the email that it was ready at 6 actually got the food at 6:15 got home and it was everything I ordered hot and fresh. Portions are huge and I love the carry out packaging as it allowed me to store my leftovers for a nice lunch later this week. It was a little stressful finding parking to just run in due to the busy mall and I ended up parking a nice walk away from the restaurant. But later saw that the curb in front is not red I probably could have parked right out front haha. All in all great experience and It did not disappoint!,91709

I recently went to this restaurant with my family and after we ordered, we had to wait over an hour to get our first dish and it was a long wait to get a table to begin with. The dishes I've tried are too salty, oily, and overpriced. There are so many good Chinese restaurants nearby that are affordable that actually taste good. But if you do eat here, then I recommend the Orange Chicken, but that's really it. I wouldn't really recommend eating here if you want your money's worth.",91709

To start they forgot a cheesecake and ice cream for 3 of our deserts. The food SUCKEDDD. All of the meat dishes were mushy and tasted like shit.  We're talking about $20+ plates. The lava cake looked like a medium sized brownie and yea overall just really disappointing. Spend your money elsewhere.,91709

Esperto Pinot Grigio a dry but great wineSpicy Green Beans - very tastySichuan Asparagus - very tastyChang's chicken  - was battered. We prefer something that is isn't.

It was Labor Day, slow day for the lunch crew some of whom probably didn't want to be at work. We came in a bit later for lunch and while the food was good (as usual) service was very slow. This is the only reason I'm giving less than 5 stars for today's visit.There were four of us and we got a bunch of items to share ""family style"" and the appetizers took a little longer than other Chang's we've eaten at. The main entrees took quite a bit longer than usual. Another thing that I noticed after we had paid and left is that our server never asked my for my phone number for the loyalty program.

Chang's again because the one in Pasadena had such crappy service, but our experience here was great.First of all: 5+ stars for service. We had two servers since one was a server in training, but both were really helpful and accommodating. They gave us lettuce refills for the chicken lettuce wraps, even if they forgot about our water.In general, I found the food kind of tasteless. My personal favorite dish is the chicken lettuce wraps. Their chicken filling for the wrap is pretty darn good. To be fair, I have also tried making my own using copycat recipes found online and they come pretty close, so it's not like P.F. Chang's taste is anything special.I found the honey walnut shrimp overly sweet, but my friend was a big fan.The Mongolian beef had a texture that was more like chicken and it was also tasteless so I personally wouldn't recommend it, but my friend who loves Mongolian beef said it was his favorite.Their special P.F. Chang's chicken was also pretty tasteless. It's said to be spicy on the menu, but it's more like sweet/sour with a very light kick (and this is coming from a person who finds Hot Cheetos too spicy).",91709

The food is about average for P.F. Chang's which I like well enough. But my 5 stars are for the bartender(s) on 03/06 and 03/08! Wednesday: Two idiots sat down at the end of the bar and began ordering appetizer after appetizer. My gut immediately told me they were gonna be pains in the ass. Of course they order a bunch of stuff then complained to the manager that things weren't cooked right, for some free stuff of course. The food was apparently SO bad that they ordered MORE food, then some to go! Even though they got lots of discounts for their whining, they gave the bartender like $2 for putting up with their sh*t all night. He and I both knew what was coming, yet he still served them WITH A SMILE and respect until the end!  I would have thrown them out.  I actually tipped for those losers because they made my blood boil. Tonight, people were being idiots, shouting orders and getting in the way even though it was busy as hell, and this team is taking it super professional! I would have told everyone to kiss my booty these last couple days but they did great. Kudos to the bar staff for consistent professionalism and smiling faces!",91709
775,"3445 Grand Ave Chino Hills, CA 91709",RIta C.,"Diamond Bar, CA",3/15/2019,5,"This comment is specifically to recommend the absolute professionalism and care of the manager-Daniel and our waiter-Johnny. Johnny was friendly and thorough with our order. He took our son's egg allergy very seriously. He checked every single dish, asked the kitchen, rechecked again with manager. We were already thankful for Johnny's due diligence, and we were completely impressed when the manager- Daniel came out with a full print out of specialized menu with egg allergy friendly meals.  In our dining experience from Michelin's star restaurants to fast food restaurants all over the world, this is the first time ever that a manager and waiter treated the issue of egg allergy with such care. Their sincere manner far exceeds the general standard of care. We are sure to become long time diners of this establishment from here on. Excellent job!Ps. From the conversation with Jonny and Daniel, we learned that simple ""edamame"" beans has one similar protein as egg, therefore, it is not listed as egg allergy friendly item. This potentially saves our son's life, as he had edamame in the past, which he should not have. Anyways, we appreciate them both. This further illustrates on how well educated this P.F.

Ordered lettuce wraps and those came out good. The hot and sour soup was super salty. The service was sub par. Our waitress came to ask us how everything was when we were done with our meal. She was very attentive to all of her other tables. Just because we have two young children doesn't mean I can't have a nice Father's Day meal with good service.,91709

The wait wasn't too bad and the service was great thanks to our server Arturo! He really made us feel special and important. He was really attentive and kept the refills coming. Our food tasted great. Before they updated their menu, we were on the brink of not really going anymore because the food was too salty and not enough veggie/vegan options. Now the food taste flavorful and they've added a small vegan/ veggie section. This visit we had crab wontons,  chicken lettuce wraps,  sangria,  sauteed eggplant, brown rice, salt n pepper prawns, surf n turf, molten chocolate cake,   lo mein, and kung pow chicken.

783,"3445 Grand Ave Chino Hills, CA 91709",Matthew J.,"La Habra, CA",6/23/2019,4,"Overall, I'm pretty satisfied. This restaurant usually has my favorite Chinese food. I recently came with my sister and father. We were feeling extra hungry and decided to splurge.For those who haven't been before, this location is large and well decorated. The lights are slightly dimmed to create a more professional ambiance. My favorite thing about the decor is the large horse outside reminiscent of their authentic roots. When you enter, there is a big space for people to wait, so nobody has to sit if it's crowd. Since I came for lunch, we didn't even have to wait. The hostess greeted us promptly and took us to our table.When we started looking at their menu, I was a little bit disappointed that the lunch menu was only available on weekdays. Nonetheless, the food looked good and the menu was well made. They added a new item called ""Mongolian potstickers"". As a Mongolian beef and potsticker lover, I was super excited to try them. I also ordered the lobster avocado roll, the black pepper chicken, the vegetable lo mein, and beef a la sichuan. The first thing that came out was the potstickers. I was very disappointed. They were over-fried and crispy. The sauce wasn't sweet. The beef on the inside was flavored weird. I thought they tasted cheesy (even though there was no cheese) but my sister just thought they weren't good. My dad was hungry, so he ended up just eating them.After that, the lobster avocado roll came out. Just as a tip, avoid getting the sushi at P.F. Chang's. It's small, not well flavored, and not that good. This particular one had an ""aioli"" sauce that tasted like mustard on top of it. None of us liked it. However, when I told the waitress about it, she was very nice and offered to replace it. I swapped it out with the chicken lettuce wraps, which are delicious.All of the entrees I ordered were terrific. The beef wasn't as spicy as I thought but the flavor was still sweet and enjoyable. The chicken was really well cooked, and the noodles had a great sauce. Somehow, we ate all of it. The portions could definitely be a lot bigger for the price we payed, but I thought it was worth it.I would definitely come back. Although I would avoid the potstickers and sushi, everything else from here is really good. Thanks for a good lunch!",91709
784,"3445 Grand Ave Chino Hills, CA 91709",Ben R.,"Southern California, CA",4/6/2018,4,"I usually avoid corporate restaurants and prefer to support only independent restaurants but I make an exception for P.F. Changs because I really like the food here. Been to this P.F. Changs quite a few times. Usually for lunch. Came again today.  I'm very disappointed to learn they took orange peel chicken off their weekday lunch specials menu (that is/was my favorite and the reason why we usually come here!).So today, I tried Chang's Spicy Chicken Bowl with brown rice (lunch special). Actually it was great. I would order it again. The three of us all got a different bowl. Mongolian Beef Bowl and a Crispy Honey Chicken Bowl. Photos below. Everyone enjoyed their food but we usually do here. We also got a side dish of spicy green beans which we all love and 3 house salads which we also love.We sometimes go to the P.F. Changs in Rancho Cucamonga (Victoria Gardens) but I don't like the parking situation (more hassle and much too congested mall traffic). Parking is much better here at the P.F. Chang's in Chino Hills!Either way, this isn't Panda Express quick food. This is quality Chinese food or to be politically correct I guess I should call it, ""Asian inspired cuisine"" although I'm sure most Asians would think this is very ""Americanized"" food. No matter what, it's still delicious.",91709

We usually come to this location for different occasions. This is the first time I had a problem. So we got seated outside which was fine. The waiter came over we ordered our drinks an appetizer and the Wonton soup to start off. The first thing we told the waiter was that my son had a shellfish food allergy. So when he comes back to the table he brings us our soup n left to go get the rest of our stuff. I began to pour some soup for my son and realized there was shrimp in the soup. Then I see the waiter running to our table   and he says I'm so sorry I just realized I grabbed the wrong soup. Wow!!!! Having a food allergy is a big deal people!!!! If your gonna work in this Industry you got to be on top of it especially when your dealing with people's lives. So he comped us for the soup. But that didn't make things ok. Anyways he brought us our meals. He took forever to get back to us to see if we needed anything else. The manager never came out to our table to apologize or see if everything was ok. But he did acknowledge the couple that was sitting next to us. He made sure they were doing good. Unbelievable!!!! Wont be going back to this PF.  Changs. Service is everything!!!!,91709

The lettuce wrap was whatever, but the chicken wings were ta-die for, it was a bit pricy at $8.00 for 5 or 6 wings, but for tasty, crispy chicken, I'll pay that!:( :( So, when my son graduated from Cal Poly, June 11th, and the chicken wings fresh on my mind, we decided to have a celebratory dinner at PF Chang's. We made reservations for 7:15, we didn't get our table until about 30 minutes later and come to find out that they don't make chicken wings anymore!! We should have walked out right then and there but...we were hungry and just gotten our seats and had a large party. Disappointed, but ordered our meal, our appetizers took another 30 mins to come out and then another 30 mins for our entrées to start showing up. We ordered the spicy chicken, Thai salad, Chinese night noodles, the lettuce wrap, chicken pad Thai, the asparagus and sautéed green beans, and a couple of other dishes, dinner and tip was around $170.

After that, the entire experience went down hill. The food:We ordered: egg drop soup, Oolang Chilean sea bass, and chicken lettuce wraps. Everything was pretty salty. In fact, I'm still thirsty as I sit here writing this review. For dessert we got the small order of the banana spring roll and Vietnamese chocolate lava cake. We also got  two decaf coffees. From one sip the coffee was extremely grainy. There were grounds of coffee in my teeth and mouth I spit it out in the napkin. We told the server and she said she would get us fresh coffee. After ten minutes she came to tell us she was making fresh coffee for us and said she knew ""it sucks, I know you ordered coffee for your desserts"" Another ten minutes later, the coffee finally arrives and our cake is now frigid cold!!! We were pretty neglected after ordering considering the three large parties nearby. We had to flag down a different server to ask the gal quasi-serving us to ask for our check. Such a shame too because it wasn't even that crowded. I don't like asking a different server for assistance, but in this case it was a must. We also felt she should've at least comped the coffees or cake since it was an overall miss. Our dissatisfaction was reflected in the less than great tip we left for the server. Overall, this was one of the WORST dining experiences we have ever had. Epic fail, PF Changs, and way to misrepresent a corporate chain. I sure hope not all PF Changs are like this. Needless to say, we won't be back. You're better off going to Pick of Stix.",91709

We ordered 2 entrees and both the entrees had the same gravy, which tasted nothing but Soy Sauce. I had ordered Garlic noodles which is not on the menu, but they still make it when we dine in.I had ordered with no veggie's on it , but they had put veggies on it. When I called them to let them know that they had messed up on it , the person I spoke to said, Lo Mein is made the same way as garlic noodles. On top of it I was overcharged. Garlic noodles are $9.00, but they charged me the price of Lo mein. It was a horrible carry out experience with PF Changs .We are regular customers, and I am not sure if we will ever go there.",91709

803,"3445 Grand Ave Chino Hills, CA 91709",Melissa M.,"Los Angeles, CA",1/29/2018,4,"Quality of food is great. Nice, clean, and modern design inside. Service is friendly and prompt. It's not authentic, but I'm pretty sure you weren't expecting that from a PF Chang's were you? LolHowever like most, the value is what I'm having a problem with. We had the steamed pork dumplings, crab wontons, beef lo mein, chicken fried rice, and honey chicken. The pork dumplings were not bad. They were juicy and steamed correctly. The crab wontons were good, with real crab meat and not overly stuffed with cream cheese as a lot of Chinese restaurants may do it. I loved the fried rice and loved loved loved the lo mein. However the price you pay for fried rice was not worth it. I would pay the price for the lo mein because  I like the sauce, and the ratio of veggies, meat, and noodles. I did not like the honey chicken. The deep fry reminded me of the sweet and sour pork/chicken without the sweet and sour sauce. Ewe.  All in all, good quality food. Authentic Chinese , no....but we are here in America where everything kinda gets intermingled with the American culture. For those who want more authentic, travel a little further up Peyton and try one of those smaller Chinese restaurants.",91709

We waited 20 minutes for a table only to be seated in a half empty restaurant. We sat there for over 10 minutes and never had a server come over. A waitress walk past us two different times and never acknowledged us. People who were seated after us were served. We tried to get the wait staffs attention but we were ignored. We finally left and said something to the hostess, she just looked at us.I wrote to P.F. Chang's and their response was we should have asked to speak to a manager.

My first time trying this place i was looking forward to but i was disappointed to have waited more than 40 minutes for our food! We had a party of 10 and our waiter was not considerate about our time. We came to enjoy lunch and left disappointed. The food was good but not as hot as i expected it to be since we waited so long.

Never againOrdered their kung pao chicken, Mongolian beef and spicy green beans.If the food takes that long I thought oh it must be good... Was I wrong! The food was warm and you can tell it's been sitting out for a while because the green beans got overcook, salty and soggy. The chicken was not covered in sauce and was dry. I think they cooked the chicken and the vegetable with the sauce separately and not cook everything altogether.The Mongolian beef was the best out of the three.Overall, not the best Chinese food I've had but what can you say it's Americanized Chinese food",91709

813,"3445 Grand Ave Chino Hills, CA 91709",Tila T.,"Sacramento, CA",2/9/2016,4,"You know what to expect when dining at PFC: expensive non-authentic chinese food. Once you're ok with that, it's actually pretty great.You can get a meal for two (appetizer, 2 entrees, and dessert) for $40-ish before tax/tip. We had a gift card for $50. Perfection!Our waiter, Gabe, was really friendly and his menu knowledge and services were on point! He quickly took our orders of chicken lettuce wraps, mongolian beef, pad thai, and banana egg roll with ice cream dessert. We decided to splurge and get an extra appetizer of the calamari.The lettuce wraps were a little too salty, but still really tasty - I really enjoyed the chopped water chestnut in there. The calamari was bo-ring - just strips of plain battered squid. It could have used a lot more seasoning, or even the fun tentacle pieces of the squid. I regret this splurge. The pad thai was flavorful, but oddly watery. The mongolian beef was meaty, but had a funny taste I cannot point at. And lastly, the fried banana egg roll was fun and went well with the ice cream. However, i recommend PFC battering the banana in panko or tempura instead because the egg roll wrapper is too thick and hard to cut through.Decor is reminiscent of cheesecake factory - high ceilings, lush furniture, fancy looking art. I'd come back here again if I had a gift card.",91709

The Front desk who took the seat took us to the table of 4 people in the middle. We wanted to sit at the table of 2 people sitting near the wall. She didn't  Agree, she said to be a Reserved for 30 people.  OK。 I asked her can we have another seat for 4 people near the wall ？She also said that it is reserved.  At this time her tone and expression have been obviously impatient. 3 times let us go to the front desk to waiting，etc. Finally, she  guide us to the middle of the table of 4 people, well, we sit here because we are very hunger.！The table is greasy and sticky, very  dirty.  After about 10-15 minutes, There are 2 people and 3 people sitting at the 2 tables..  I went to and ask the 2 tables of guests, they all said that there is no appointment, just walk in!  I asked the manager why they can and we can't sit?  I want to know what happened?  The manager explained the priority of the reservation, and if the scheduled guest canceled, it can be given to the guest who walked in.  I told the manager: I have already asked the guests, they have not booked!  The manager also found a reason to say what the scheduled guest canceled, I said: You know that this is a lie!  The female manager said she would ask the front desk what happened and will come back ..  I haven't seen the female manager back after I paid the bill and the tip.  I had to ask the Delivery waiter to told the manager again ：I am still waiting for her reply.  After a few minutes a male manager came out and repeated the same reason as the before manager , and then asked me what I needed to help?  I need to know what reason we can't sit in those seats?  Or just say ""sorry ""to us because you whole servicer have been lying.  The manager said very sorryly that he was not sincere.  He did not think that their behavior was wrong.  I will keep my dissatisfaction with them because they are not worthy of what I say.  When we left, there were still customers in the waiting area, and there were already a lot of Empty seat in the restaurant inside！which meant that they deliberately created a lot of illusions for the guests!  !  !  No special food plus bad service, will you come back next time?我们在周六晚餐时间到这家餐厅，人很多，我们只有2人，领坐的女服务员带我们去中间4人位的桌子，我们想做坐在靠近墙边的2人的桌子，她不同意，说是留给30人的聚会。我问她另外一边4人的座位可以吗？她也说是预留的位置。这时她语气和表情已经明显很不耐烦.3次让我们去服务台等.最后还是带我们去中间的那个4人桌，好吧，我们已经很饿了，只好坐这里.桌子上油腻腻的粘手，很脏。大概过了10-15分钟，那2个位置上有人坐下。我去问了那2桌的客人，他们都说没有预约，跟我们一样没有预约. 我问经理为什么他们可以而我们不可以坐在那边的座位？发生了什么？经理解释说预定的优先，如果预定的客人取消了那么才可以给没有预约的客人。我告诉经理：我已经问过了那些客人，他们都没有预约. 你也知道没有人预约那些桌子。女经理又找理由说什么预定的客人取消了，我说：你明明知道这是谎言！女经理说她去问一下前台再来告诉我，然后就消失了。我结账并支付小费之后还没有见到那位女经理回来。只好再次请送菜员帮忙告诉经理我还在等她答复。这时出来的是一位男经理，跟前面那个经理一样的理由又重复了一遍，然后问我有什么需要帮忙的？我告诉他我需要知道什么理由我们不可以坐在那些座位？或者就跟我道歉吧，因为你们一直在撒谎。经理很不诚心的说了对不起。看的出来他不认为他们的行为有错误。我就保留对他们的不满吧，因为他们不值得我再说什么了。当我们离开的时候，等待区依然有顾客，而此时餐厅里面已经有很多空位，也就是说他们故意营造一种客人很多的假象！！！想吃中国菜还是另选其他吧没有什么特色的食物加上很差的服务，下次还会再光临吗？",91709

Whenever I am working in our Chino Hills office, my coworkers and I come here for happy hour which ends up turning it into a dinner usually. It is extremely easy to locate and it has ample amount of parking available. It has indoor and outdoor seating with a bar seating separate. The service here is really great, quick and attentive. It can be bit pricey but their food proportions make up for it. I always have leftovers for lunch next day. Few of my go-to dishes here [I switch it up depending on the mood of my taste buds]:-- Vegetable Lo Mein-- Chili Garlic Green Beans [MY FAVORITE!]: I have tried making it few times on my own but obliviously it has not eve come close to theirs.-- Vegetable Fried Rice-- Pad Thai: can never go wrong with the pad thai.-- Vegetarian Lettuce Wraps: I had one of my coworker try them and since then he started eating the vegetarian lettuce wraps rather than the regular ones.Last time I came here for happy hour, our bartender [really nice lady] was friendly and was chatting with us. She offered for us to try the citrus - light green colored shot, I forgot the name of the drink but she said that it's her favorite and she would like to get our opinion on it. It was by far the most subtle and yet refreshing shot I have ever had.  It was nice of her to offer those shots on the house.One of my coworker loves coming here because they have gluten free options!

In regards to the wait staff, they were excellent.  The wait staff stopped by frequently, ensured our drinks were full, and they were professional.  If not for the great service, this would be a two star review.",91709

I always get their dynamite shrimp (tdf!!), dan dan noodles, and hot and sour soup. Every dish was perfect! I kept going back and the quality of the food was consistent. So when I moved here, I was so excited to eat at PF and expected the food to be better since the chain originated in this country. Imagine my surprise when my whole experience turned out to be a letdown. The hot and sour soup was not only NOT hot, but the texture was so thick and the color looked so dark! The bamboo shoot and soy sauce overpowered the flavor. I asked our server to have the kitchen heat up our soup and it came back more or less the same temperature. Room temp. We decided to send it back and cancel our order. Which they obliged. They gave us complimentary bowls of freshly cooked soup, it was warm but the flavor and texture was still off. Their dan dan noodles were alright. Noodles were slightly over cooked, a bit too saucy than the usual, which made the dish a tad mushy feel in the mouth. Good thing the dynamite shrimp was delicious as always! 2 stars for the shrimp! I love how it's crisp and creamy and spicy at the same time, and the shredded lettuce underneath compliments the flavor of the sauce. Omg. I would still come back but only for the dynamite shrimp and nothing else. I will never make the mistake of ordering any other dish from there ever again.",91709

Of all the years it's been in the shoppes I've never eaten here until tonight-and now I know why. I am by no means an expert on Asian food and I came in knowing that this is inauthentic ""asian"" fusion but still ended up disappointed. Two stars for the ambience; the decor is like something you'd see in Yardhouse or something. It's modern and dimly lit and seems like a good place for large groups to gather. The service was inattentive and rushed even though we came in on a slow week night. The food was just gross. Everything was saucy and flavorless and the meat was tough and fibrous. I took a bite of everything we ordered and the only thing edible was the beef with broccoli. This place is really expensive for what it is.

828,"3445 Grand Ave Chino Hills, CA 91709",Grace T.,"Rowland Heights, CA",3/16/2018,2,So far it's not going well my mom and I finally got around to visit this place. We are extremely skeptical of chinese restaurants run by American ppl as are most Asians. But I wanted to broaden my horizon so I dragged my mom here. The service takes a while for they try to deliver all the food at once along with the drinks so u have to wait as a collective. As for an appetizer we order the Sweet and sour soup. BOY IS THERE A FAR DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AUTHENTIC ACTUAL CHINESE FOOD AND THIS. disappointment filling.  Is waiting for main course. Got the main course. There was sand in bok choy for it wasn't washed clean enough. We would know we often cooked this food often enough to know that there is sometimes sand. And it's difficult to wash it off. When confronted the waitress offered another plate of the same veggies. We accepted and this time no sand. The miso salmon was quite good. I got to admit it was nice with the veggies and had a nice miso sauce with mushrooms too. The dragon New roll was disappointing the sushi level was about the same as a regular California roll with Soracha sauce on it. How do I explain this to ppl who doesn't have access to authentic Chinese food; it's like Denny's of the Chinese food. This is the basic standard of Chinese food. Nothing special doesn't taste amazing but it's ok. Not the soup though as some items in Denny's aren't meant to be enjoyed.,91709

I suspect this because some portion were warm and other were cold. I gave them the benefit of the doubt and tried my wife's dumplings but unfortunately that was just as cold. My wife loves this place and disagrees. The flavor was good but just too cold especially for the price you pay.

Changs, and felt secure that this one would be consistent with all the others we've been to.I won't bore you with a lengthy text of how poor the service was. The best I can say about the staff was that they were all very friendly. Unfortunately, they are very young and unprofessional. The entire crew spends more time socializing amongst themselves than they do taking care of customers. They don't know any better because management apparently doesn't provide the guidance and training necessary to provide good service.Fortunately the food was the usual fare, and the lettuce wraps were awesome, as usual.Sorry, we won't be going back anytime soon.",91709

I like to just disregard what other people say and appreciate it for what it is. We had a great dinner here the other night and received amazing service from our server David who greeted us with a huge smile and was delightful. Heres what we ordered:Hot and Sour Sour (5/5): Delish! My very soup here. Not too sour nor salty perfectly executed. Chicken Lettuce Wraps (4/5): The perfect way to start your meal. Very light with the lettuce wraps and a great filling Orange Chicken (4/5): A classic orange chicken that doesnt taste too greasy or oily. It has a ton of flavor for white chicken. Its a little addicting.Cashew and Almond Chicken (4/5): Another stellar choice. You can't go wrong with it. Not too salty and perfect with white or brown rice.Mongolian Beef (3/5): Good but not great. Its been really great in the past, but this time around it was a bit crunchy and chewy. A tad overcooked, had it been taken off sooner it would've been better.",91709

My bf and I was initially seated inside but when I saw the patio and with the nice weather, I asked our server if we can be seated outside. Initially it was close but she made it happen for us. We were the only ones outside and it felt nice to talk out loud and eat without other people around. We order a decent amount of food knowing we would take the left overs to go for later. Server was attentive and professional. My only con is that I wish the Chang's spicy chicken had more spicy sauce to it. I probably could've asked the server to add the sauce to that plate, but I was feeling pretty good with my Asian pear mojito, and with all the food on the table it was just time to dig in.

The same waitress that walked by us 3 or more times, seeing the manager at the host table NOW, wants to help. Once at our table, again the waiting begins. 10 mins and no one ask if we even want water. Again, the manager comes to the floor from the back and then our waiter comes.

I called today (a Friday afternoon) for a  reservation at 6:00 p.m. in the evening.  My husband and I generally do not travel eastbound on the 91 freeway from North Orange County on Friday afternoon, but our son was visiting from out-of-state, and he asked if we could dine there.  I requested a table with chairs or a half booth/half table.  I repeated it twice, and I was assured there would be no problem at all.  I also requested a specific server.  I was assured this was also not a problem.  Even though the traffic was typical Friday afternoon traffic and included an accident which caused traffic to completely stop for a while, we arrived at 5:54 p.m.  Our total travel time was over an hour to travel 17 miles.  There were three people at the hostess desk, and the restaurant appeared to be less than half full.  One of the hostesses said we would need to wait since we had arrived early (a whopping SIX minutes early) for our 6:00 p.m. reservation.  We were also told we would not be able to be seated in our favorite server's section because she was only assigned to booths.  One of the hostesses said there were notes on our reservation indicating both of my requests.  I was told we would have to sit with another server if we wanted a half booth/half table or a table with chairs.  I said we would go to another restaurant if that was the case.  After 21 minutes, we were finally seated at a table with chairs with our favorite server.  I counted five empty tables in our section at 6:15 on Friday night, yet it took 21 minutes for three people at the hostess desk to determine how to solve this dilemma?  PF Chang's management, if you are reading this, it's important to remember that stellar service begins at the hostess desk.      I am not sure if this location operates without a manager, but this appears to be the case.  I remember several years ago when this PF Chang's was expertly run by a manager who stopped at each table to inquire about the service and food.  Sadly, this is no longer the case.  Can a restaurant run itself?  Apparently not.  That being typed, the food was good, but the constant changes and deletions on the menu are just plain annoying.  Our server, as always, was excellent.  She is the only reason I can give this review two stars.",91709

He did the absolute best he could, and I seriously would have ran out and said EFF THIS if I were him. Our waters weren't filled, and some food didn't come out but we were ok with it because we understood. Half way through our visit I reassured him that we understood we were a large party, and he was doing a good job. But what kind of manager allows this? You basically fed him to the wolves, poor guy!

Gross!!!!!! I could have gone to an actual REAL Chinese place down the street and gotten something authentic, better and cheaper!!    I ordered curb side.  I should have known the food was trash when my dog started barking once we parked.   I should have taken head to her warning. The girl who brought my food out was nice though, she even told me right of the back that they gave me an extra side of fried rice.  Which I didn't order.  But that was thoughtful right?....No it wasn't in the end.  It was just as disgusting as the food I ordered!   The chicken looks like it was a cross between the chicken you get from the frozen section at target and someone's left overs. The rice looked like they piled it into the box from various patrons plates and the soup...  omg!! The soup was inside of a Tupperware like container and it was only a quarter ways full!.  I guess that's why she gave me the fried rice? To compensate for the quarter filled soup.    I was craving pf changs and they brutally failed me!!!!   Panda Express is even better than pf changs!   I wouldn't eat there again even if the Chang man himself asked me too!  And cooked for me personally!!!  I definitely donated money tonight.

The first time I went to this restaurant was for take out. Two customers were ahead of me and they were waiting there for 15 minute before being acknowledged. I waited for a whole 25 minute and the waitress or bartender was there she saw me just waiting there I haven't even given my order yet. Not once did she acknowledge me or say hi or I'll be with you. But she was rude. There was a group of people behind where I was waiting that just sat down and she told them I'll be with right away and just left me waiting there so I finally walked out. Second time I came here almost 40 minute for my food to come out. Waitress and waiters are no where to be found. So I'm just waiting with a crying baby to ask for the check.

866,"3445 Grand Ave Chino Hills, CA 91709",Todd H.,"San Francisco, CA",2/11/2018,1,"FYI: I sent this note to the restaurant's management. When I received no response after a few days, I sent it to their corporate office and decided to post here.To The Management Team:My wife and I have dined at your restaurant on Grand Avenue in Chino Hills on occasion --- as well as other P.F. Chang's locations --- and always had been pleased with the experience. Our visit Tuesday, Feb. 6, however, was unpleasant to the point that we left without ordering a thing.We arrived at approximately 7:20 p.m. and waited for several minutes at your host stand without anyone acknowledging we were there. While the hostess on duty was away from the front of the restaurant --- and, understandably, that happens from time to time --- a few servers walked by, seemingly noticed us and just kept going. No one bothered to help us or even let us know someone eventually would be with us. That lack of customer service was the first sign that something was amiss.When your hostess made it to the front of the restaurant, she took us to your booth closest to the kitchen --- an odd, loud choice with many open tables --- but that wasn't the issue. The problem was that there was food on the bench seat in several places, our first indication that your restaurant was not being cleaned properly.When my wife pointed out the dirty seats, the hostess took us to another booth. As I climbed in, my wife saw that the seats there also had food on them. She asked the hostess for some napkins to wipe the seat clean, and the hostess returned with the napkins and handed them to my wife so that she could clean the seat. As I was stunned to see your hostess' utter lack of effort to rectify the situation, my wife cautioned me to look out for the layer of food that had not been cleaned off the table.At that point, we were done and walked out, even though we had a free entree coming our way as part of your Rewards Program.After all, if the places your customers can see quite clearly are filthy, how disgusting is your kitchen? I've worked in a handful of restaurants and cannot imagine any supervisor of mine tolerating the lack of cleanliness we experienced.In addition, we were blown away by your staff's complete disregard for customer service --- all the way through the point where your hostess showed absolutely no interest in the fact that we were so disgusted that we felt the need to leave.It was fairly obvious that your hostess was not going to relay what happened to your management team, so I felt compelled to let you know.I'd be interested to learn from you if this is acceptable or an aberration. Either way, I do not expect we will return to your location or other P.F. Chang's locations anytime in the near future.",91709

I walked in, and the hostesses didn't acknowledge me right away even though I was in front of their faces. They said 25 min to 30 min wait. Ok sure. We wait. A party of 5 walk in and another party of 2. We are all sitting in the waiting area. The party of 5 gets seated and my cousin noticed that we were here first. I didnt think much of it. Then the party of 2 that clearly came after us also got called to get sat. And that party of 2 said to us ""weren't you guys here 1st?"" And the hostess didnt respond or acknowledge us. At this point I asked how much longer it is to be seated and they told me we were next. In my head I thought ""oh really? It's not hard to keep track of who got here 1st. Simple rotation."" I've worked in restaurants before so I have sympathy a lot for foodservice workers but this was ridiculous. Finally the hostess called us. She didn't acknowledge the elephant in the room. If she would have just acknowledged it was a mistake and apologized I would have been happy, but she ignored the problem and acted like she did nothing wrong. We got sat, and it took a long time to get service. Now, I was a server, so I understand when a restaurant is understaffed. So I dont blame my server for the horrible experience it was the hostesses in the front. It all went down hill from there and ruined the whole dining experience.

The food is awesome and our server even brought out a gluten-free menu when I asked for Gluten free options... they have gluten free Soy Sauce!My favorite things here is the veggie coconut curry with brown rice and the chicken lettuce wraps - so good!!Don't forget the mustard sauce :),91709
873,"3445 Grand Ave Chino Hills, CA 91709",Pamela M.,"Brea, CA",12/26/2013,3,"I came here on Christmas Eve expecting a large crowd inside, but I was pleasantly surprised to find the restaurant pretty empty. Granted, I got there around 2:00pm the day before Christmas. I'm guessing everyone either already ate an hour before or is somewhere doing last minute shopping. There were 3 other small parties in the restaurant, each had anywhere from 2-4 guests tops. CRISPY GREEN BEANS ""Tempura-battered with our signature spicy dipping sauce""Very, very good. Not exactly a healthy vegetable dish, but it is extremely good. The sauce they serve it with is not too spicy but has enough of a kick to please those who like it hot.SHRIMP WITH CANDIED WALNUTS ""Tender shrimp tossed in a creamy sauce with candied walnuts and honeydew melon""This isn't your typical honey walnut shrimp, though that's what the dish is based off of. The difference is the honeydew melon, which adds a different flavor to the overall dish and adds a bit more sweetness to it.I didn't like this. At first I did, but after a few more bites, I realized that the flavor was off somewhere. It might've been the melon or it could've been the sauce they put all together. I am a huge fan of traditional honey walnut shrimp and this just didn't do it for me. Not to mention, the melon is just plain weird to me when put together with this dish. The shrimp wasn't crispy like I'm used to. It was soggy and drenched in way too much sauce. The candied walnuts were really good, though.KUNG PAO CHICKEN   ""Chicken breast stir-fried with peanuts, chili peppers and scallions""This dish is just okay. I've had better kung pao chicken for less money at a local, smaller Chinese food restaurant. The sauce tastes like it came from a bottle they got at a grocery store and it was wayyyyy too salty.CRISPY PAN FRIED NOODLE WITH BEEFI couldn't find this item on their online menu but they have it in their in house menus. This is the best noodles they have on the menu! Seriously, so good. The noodles are thicker than I'm used to, but that was a good thing. The noodles were still very crispy when it was brought to us, despite the fact that it was topped with a heaping of the sauce, meat and vegetables. We inhaled this stuff, it was so good. Highly recommend.The food came out in large servings. Everything mentioned above, if ordered all together, could feed 4 people comfortably. It was a lot of food, but it did come with a hefty bill. Not including the appetizer, each dish was about $14 (more or less). The service as this location isn't the best. The male host that sat us down had difficulty hearing our orders and kept saying, ""huh?"" ""what?"" ""what'd you say?"" over and over again. Reminder, there was basically no one in the restaurant except for a couple small groups, whom we were sitting far away from. We weren't whispering either... not really sure what happened there. Also, the food took a really long time coming out. I couldn't imagine why this was, since we were the only ones ordering. The other tables had their food already. I give them the benefit of the doubt that MAYBE they had phone orders, but almost 30 minutes for our food to come out was unacceptable. With the price, ok food, subpar service and long wait times (despite being the only ones there), I don't know if I'll come back. I don't even want to know what this place is like on a busy night if it took this long for us midday.",91709

We got like 5 pieces of crispy honey chicken, no sign of there ever being any crisp either. The Mongolian beef is literally beef chunks in a watery liquid, nothing like it used to be.

COLD!  Sent back and still came out COLD!  The food taste was good, but how does every dish including the rice come out cold??  The kitchen staff needs a reboot!  I actually felt bad for our server, he brought me a Birthday desert to try to make it right...  it wasn't exactly the celebration I had intended.  The restaurant is always empty...  this should be a clue.  I'm done PFC!",91709

878,"3445 Grand Ave Chino Hills, CA 91709",Rani E.,"Anaheim, CA",6/20/2019,1,I used to come to this place and used to have good experiences. Brought my daughter for her first time for lunch. The Indian girl working as the hostess gave us bad attitude. I asked for a booth and she said there was a party of ten coming and no booths where available. Note they are not there yet.  Other booths where open she was too lazy to go behind her counter to look and see. I had to walk the floor myself. Finally she says let me take you to that booth. My daughter wanted to look outside and as we are coming back in a manager seats people at our table we chose. Horrible customer service. Manager didn't bother to apologize instead just tried to rush us back in just to seat us.  I will never return to this location again as long as these two individuals are still working there 06/20/2019 1:35pm the service from the employees don't even deserve a half star!! We went right across from them to have lunch at California Pizza Kitchen. Friendly service and they treated me and my daughter with respect.  If your having a bad time at P.F. Chang's just walk across the street to  CPK. You will definitely have a better experience over there and they are very kid friendly.,91709

The food quality and presentation looked like they hired the Panda Express chef. It was all soooo salty. I hadn't eaten all day and of course was famished by 5:00. I ate it anyway. The only nice thing that came out to dinner was the chateau st. Michelle Riesling. To top it off my husband and I both got so sick that night and the next morning with diarrhea and stomach aches.

883,"3445 Grand Ave Chino Hills, CA 91709",Ryan M.,"Covina, CA",12/20/2018,4,"Very sad to report that I won't be able to eat at PF Chang's ever again... The issue started last year.. Me and my wife ordered some lettuce wraps at PF Chang's and got a Christmas tree on a Saturday night in December of 2017. Nothing happened to the wifey, but I broke out in a full body rash that looked like ""whiplash"" marks 1-2 days later.. I thought it was the tree, so I bought a fake tree this year and thought nothing of it.. This past Saturday, December 15th we went to PF Chang's (I had not been back since the last time in Dec 2017). We got the lettuce wraps, and sure enough 1-2 days later I have the exact same head to toe rash. After a doctor visit, some blood work, and some research, I discovered that it was not an allergic reaction at all. It was actually a ""toxic reaction"" to the shiitake mushrooms in the wraps.. Google the term ""shiitake dermatitis"".. That's what I currently have.. I don't place any blame on PF Chang's though (hence the 4 star review)..  I am not here to encourage people to not eat here.. Their food is amazing and they have excellent service. It's totally not their fault that my body reacted that way to the shiitake in the lettuce wraps.. I am only posting this to make people aware of the possibility that this could happen to them.. It sucks, because I really enjoyed PF Chang's.. I just can't eat there ever again unfortunately.. Total bummer..",91709
884,"3445 Grand Ave Chino Hills, CA 91709",Lin F.,"Murrieta, CA",6/4/2011,4,"Liquid salt. I'm 100% Chinese but I really dig this caucASIAN Chinese food place. Does that make me a ""banana?"" Every ""chinese"" dish is westernized, so authentic Asians expecting ""chinese"" food BEWARE. PF's justifies by utilizing the word FUSION  & BISTRO. So you were notified prior to entry. Dishes I order over and over again...so much salt that I gain 4 # the next day from water retention...Chicken lettuce wraps- server makes a sauce with red chili, soy sauce, horseradish mustard, rice wine vinegar can ""cool"" it off. More yellow mustard to ""heat"" it.Salt and pepper calmari- no sog, only downer is more rings than legsWonton soup serves 4 - yum, like homemade chicken soup, filled with 6+ wontons, shrimps, spinach, Ginger, watercress, carrots. Soup made since am, PF boils 6 pollos per cauldron for that homemade clear chicken broth. People with penicillin allergies may even start wheezing after sipping this delicious-o soup!Salt and pepper prawns- delicious fried jumbo shrimp, crispy so good you eat all parts for extra calciumMongolian beef- every non-Asian friend gobbles this sweetly marinated beef. Tons of leeks for Added flavor. I dig it too, but I don't fight for the last bite.  Garlic noodles - garlic...lots of it to provide aromatherapy from your skin the following day. Yum Kung poa chicken- classic good! Chicken is white meat and brownned to seal juices. Dry at times, not really spicy enough but you can add sauce.Moo shu chicken or pork- yum! Lots of shitake mushrooms, tender bamboo shoots, cabbage, pork, plum sauce. Server makes the roll for you! Honey crisp chicken or walnut honey shrimp both 5 stars! Fried outer coating is not too ""batter"" dipped. Sweet caloric delights.Garlic Spinach side dish is as described and consistent.Add asparagus to Kung Pao chicken or scallops for extra cat-like odor to urine...I mean... for added fiber and flavor to your dish. Last but not least, a dessert unique to PF's: banana spring rolls, coconut ice cream (yes there is dairy in it, but even my lactose intolerant body craves this cold confection). Drizzled caramel and seasonal fruit ""sprinkled"" as garnish. This dessert is meant for sharing, unless you want to consume the 1600 cal. all by your fat bottomed self. Avoid...Catfish (hot fish) ugh eh blah! Don't eat this bottom feeder. Dim sum happy hour items were meh. (all items- eh; I really prefer authentic Chinese grade B places for dim sum). You kinda have to be drunk to like those flavorless, juicy-less, everythings. Duck with pancakes- defatted, cold duck, only one bone in it from the leg. The duck was just ok. I wish the skin was crispy fried like a pork rind. Eh.Fried rice with beef- meh eh ugh (just eat their free brown or white rice, the white rice tastes like Uncle Bens. brown rice is more succulent)Tips..On Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday...Victoria Garden's make a reservation and STILL BE prepared to WAIT at least 30 minutes if it's prime time 6-8:30 pm. Before or after those time or days You'll be OK. The Riverside PF's actually keeps their reservation times regardless if it's busy or not. Hooray.

Ask for plates, ask for silverware.  He would bring one thing out and disappear. We waited for our check for like 10 minutes. As soon as he put it down we where ready to pay, he looked at it and then went the other way. My husband was so frustrated he went to look for someone to take out money. They had a promotion during the holidays buy $100 in gift cards get $20 back. The promotional card was about to expire and came to use it.

We sat down ordered drinks and appetizers, and simultaneously placed our order for five entrees.  Our drinks and appetizers appeared with little delay and all seemed to be on course for a nice meal. Wrong!  We consumed our appetizers and then began to wait, and wait. After about 30 minutes (three crosswords in the kids menu later) we gave the server a gentle nudge to inquire as to when our entrees would arrive. We then asked another server at 45 minutes, and yet another to speak to a manager. Finally, as we are about to walk out at an hour had lapsed Nikki (the ""manager"") showed up to apologize. Ha!  She said ""sorry"", but your food is almost ready (we heard that for the last 30 minutes). At this point we just asked to leave. She then proceeded to bring us a check for two appetizers a kids milk and a diet soda!  Like it was our fault that we weren't willing to wait any longer. She brought us a check, waited for us to give her a credit card and stormed off with it. Thankfully the General Manager came over to try to diffuse the situation and give us some certificates for future use.

The worst one is the chang's fried rice, the rice was way overcooked and it has clump of mushed rice and again its lack of flavor, and seems like soy sauce is their only seasoning. The sweet vanilla creme wontons is the best thing we had out of all things that we ordered.

I should have stayed and waited at Wood Ranch.Upon entering the restaurant, I happened to walk through the dining room to use the restrooms and noticed a large party of kids (high school, I believe). While walking by their table I overheard them cussing up a storm, no doubt thinking they were edgy and ""cool"" for doing so. I made a mental note to ask the hostess not to sit me next to them. When I came back, I did request not to be sat next to them, however, the hostess who seemed to be coordinating (Asian girl), had the biggest scowl on her face, and appeared to glare at everyone who came in, or who dared talk with her. So I don't think my request was received too warmly.After about a 15 minute wait, I was sat. Guess where? Yep, next to the tweens. Highschoolers on my right side, and two screaming kids on my left. Exactly where I requested NOT to be sat. So I sat there for about 5 minutes before my server came out while the mothers of the screaming kids on my left decided it was perfectly acceptable to allow their kids to run and jump on the cushioned seat we shared (I was seated on the long row of tables with one shared bench seat). In fact, one of the kids even came over by my table, and the mother, noticing this said, ""Oh, don't mind him, he's harmless"". Really? Did I mistakenly walk into a Chuck E. Cheese restaurant? In retrospect, I should have asked to swap tables, but I wanted to be fair to my server.Josh was my server, and while nice, and appearing sympathetic to the tables I had surrounding me, service was still slow - very slow. To his credit, he brought me out an appetizer on the house for me (fried green beans) because of the ""noise"". I didn't ask for them, nor did I particularly care for them (not a green bean fan), but the gesture was appreciated.I DID order fried crab wontons, which were delicious, and for dinner I ordered the Shaking Beef, which was also tasty. The food was not the problem, the service was. I had quite a long wait from when I ordered my appetizer until I received it, and even longer until I was able to order dinner. Rarely, did I see my server, unless he was bringing out my food, and even had a manager bring me out refills because my server seemed nowhere to be found.When my server DID bring me out dinner, or refills, the empty dishes were left to sit on my table - perhaps to keep me company as I was dining alone? The notion of pre-bussing seemed to be lost on Josh. When I left my dinner, I had 3 empty glasses, my appetizer (green beans, which had a napkin in them symbolizing I no longer wanted them), the small plate each seat gets, and my dinner plates. All of that should have been removed throughout the night, and when I asked for my check, all remaining plates should have been cleared away.Does no one pre-bus tables anymore? Do I have unrealistic expectations when I dine out? Somebody answer me, please!While I was dining, the table of highschoolers to my right, used profane language the entire time - one kid in particular was exceptionally rude. He couldn't have been older than 15. During the course of my dinner, I had to listen to him talk about how he wanted to ""slap a 'h**' around"", ""keep his 'b****' in line"" and use the F and S word (4 letters each) repeatedly. In fact, other tables were turning around and looking as well. I was tempted to say something, and was about to, but then his table started singing ""Happy Birthday"" to him, and I couldn't in good conscious say something which would have ruined his birthday (I guarantee).While I was waiting for my check, the hostess I mentioned earlier (Asian girl, permanent scowl on her face), was walking around the dining room pushing a manual vacuum. This is actually commendable - keeping the restaurant looking nice. However, when she came to my table, she pushed the vacuum between my table, and the table to my left, hitting my shoes. Rude! I understand vacuuming the main dining room, but by peoples' feet while they are eating?!When my check came, I signed and left. But before I left, I took a bite from the fortune cookie given to me. Stale. Seemed like an appropriate ending to my night.",91709

I don't know why restaurants insist on blaring noise to the point where people cannot hear, but this trend really needs to end. Thankfully, our waitress was kind and took pity on us, giving us a table on the patio despite the hostesses' reluctant to do so. I recommend PF Changs highly but only if you can get a seat on their patio. If not for the noise issue, I would give it 5 stars.",91709

We had to continue to ask for things, we had our son and had to tell them to give us plastic utensils, plastic plate. What got me the most was that the waitress brings clean plates and we figured that we would get our meal immediately, NOPE wrong 20  minutes  later our food is brought to the table; the waiter forgets about our rice that comes with the meal. It seemed that the waitress was more interested in other tables than ours. I'm a paying customer- she seemed bothered every time we would ask for something. We were there 1 1/2 hrs the waitress didn't great us as we were leaving. As for the food we got the chicken lettuce wrap which was tasty and the Mongolian steak was also tasty but overall I would not come back again.",91709

928,"3445 Grand Ave Chino Hills, CA 91709",William E.,"La Mirada, CA",5/20/2018,1,"I was at this PF Chang's locations for a very nice lunch for Mother's Day. It was anything but that. Let's start that I had reservations for 1:45PM. I walked into the locations at 1:40PM and gave my name to the team member. She found me in the computer system. She then informs me that it will be a while. I was like umm ok I will wait a few moments before I say anything as the location had a few dirty tables that no one was paying attention to. At 2:10PM I was like what is going on I have reservations for 1:45PM this is not acceptable as I had other things to do that afternoon. She was like oh let me see what the holdup is. They then find me the smallest table in the restaurant location in between 2 parties of 6+ people. Let's not talk about if the person behind me needs to get up to leave or use the restroom I will have to move first. This is a very poor lay out of the main floor for the guest. The server came to take the drink order I then informed them that in my reservation is had asked for a larger table do to the amount of food that the family orders. She was like oh well I am not sure if I can move you but I will look into it for you. 10 minutes had passed as another server came to take our drink orders and we explained to them that someone else had already taken them but still had not brought them to our table at this time. She said that she would be right back. She had the drinks and also said that they would be moving us to a bigger table as we requested. Please mind you it has now been 45 mints since we had walked into the restaurant that this was now getting fixed. She took our order and brought out the appetizers that we had requested. Now our server had 4-5 tables except one of them was a table with a family of 9 people and one was with 6. She was not given any help other than a runner to bring out the food. Our food comes out to our table around 3:25-3:30PM. NO plates the runner has to run and get them. We start eating as we are enjoying out meal we ask for more brown rice. No understand that this around 3:45PM-3:50PM the locations are still open for at least 5  1/2 more hours. They come back like 5 minutes later and say oh we are out of brown rice. How in the hell do you run out of brown rice in a Chinese restaurant before the dinner rush?  I asked to speak to a manager about this issues as this was not acceptable for this to take place as my family does not eat white rice. The manager comes out to speak with me at the same time they have plates and glasses break in the main dinner room and parts of fly all over the place towards guest. Their response to me was that they are busy, and they did not think that this would happen. I was like you have a POS System that tracks all the items. Not a good answer . She was like let me see what she could do to help.She came back to apologize and offer a $25 gift card for a future visit. I just want to get things that I order is it that had now days.Area that they failed* Not sitting guest as requested the first time* Dirty plates* Restroom stall doors that do not lock* Dirty tables and food items still on them when we were seated* Running out of Brown Rice before the dinner rushIt is just so sad to see how some locations are ran now in the retail world. I travel for work all over this great nation and it is not just on the west coast it is all over.If you can go to a different locations of this chain I would try Anaheim, Torrance, Long Beach, Beverly Center.",91709

I waited over an hour to get our food and the food was not even cooked properly. If you are going to be charging that much you should at least show it on the plate not complaining about the portion but the quality of the food is extremely important soggy shrimp over cooked filet mignon and greasy lobster and a plate that looks like a 5 year old plated not very appetizing to begin with.

The food is always on point and the service is always great. We recently moved so we thought we could come to this location since it's closer, but sad to say it was not up to par... The food was bland. And our waitress was just awful the whole night. I understand you have bad days and good days but she had a rude attitude. It's hard for us to go out since we are struggling college students but it was our 9 year anniversary and we just wanted a nice  dinner since it was on a Tuesday night. It's really disappointing that our experience wasn't nice, and spending 65$ for a dinner that was bland and a waitress that was awful is really upsetting.

We showed up, called them and said we were there and they said they would be right out. Between 7:30pm and 8:00pm we called 3 times and each time they said they would be right out. We finally called the last time and cancelled our $97.00 order.

We started with the Spicy Tuna Roll appetizer and had the Grilled Salmon, Buddha's Delight, Ginger Chicken and House Special Fried Rice.  The Spicy Tuna Roll was barely edible. The Ginger Chicken was worst than cheap Chinese takeout. The only thing good about the meal was the great service. They were very attentive and keeps on refilling our ice tea. The Grilled Salmon was dry and way overcooked. The whole bill came out to around $100 including the tip. Ouch!!  We could've ordered at least 10 dishes in a half way decent Chinese restaurant.

Waitress was nice but a little too nice (I know, I'm weird that I am not a fan of ""too nice"") anyhow we ordered the prix frix for two. Lettuce wraps looked great but I passed bc of the chicken (don't eat it). Hot and sour soup was yummy and warm. Kung pao shrimp was crispy and yummy but could have used a little more heat. Again, would I say that this was a delicious Chinese meal? No I wouldn't but it was delicious food. It's like Taco Bell, do people go there to get Mexican food? No, they go to get Taco Bell! Same with PFC, you go for the PFC taste. The desert was rich with peanuts, caramel and chocolate.

Because of happy hour, we decided to order a variety of small plates, so we had a fairly large order and she didn't write down the order. That was the first worry. Then, when the food came out, we were missing our dumplings, so we asked and she kind of stuttered and says 'Oh yeah, they just take a little longer'. This is not true, as we've ordered them as an appetizer before and we know that they are pre made and just need to be steamed. It was obvious that she had forgotten them. She also never brought our rice, which we decided not to even ask for again because we hardly saw her throughout the meal.We enjoyed our meal and then waited around for about 15 minutes for her to come back to give us our check and box up our leftovers. We were paying with an e gift card, which we've used before, and she has me write down the number and give it to her. She comes back and says it wouldn't work. I give her my phone to try again and I watch as she delivers 2 people's orders and delivers someone's check all while holding my iPhone. Crazy.She comes back again and says my phone locked and asks me to unlock it. Of course it locked, you delivered several orders while holding it! She then goes back and tries again and again says it won't work. I show her the gift card balance that I looked up on PFChangs.com and she says 'yeah, sorry' and says that ALL of her managers are in a meeting, so there's nothing she can do. Rather than continue to argue, we just pay with a credit card and get out of there.  I hope those busy busy managers read this and reevaluate! For future happy hour dinners, we will visit the Rancho or Anaheim locations where bar area service has always been great.",91709

I've been to one before and I forget how good their food is , deserts were amazing as well. Kids meals are great portion and my child loved it . Many options and the best part is if your on a strict diet (fitness competitor ) you can't have oil so I got everything steamed ! Super healthy options :)",91709

I had the lunch special honey chicken, it was good and filling. My complaint would be our server rarely checked in on us and was hard to find. I had to ask the hostess for our server. Mind you, this place was pretty empty for lunch. That should have been an indicator to go elsewhere.

She also kept forgetting to bring things we had ordered and when we reminded her she had a snippy attitude. Once again when we ordered the food that took an extremely long time almost to the point where it seemed likely that we had been forgotten about but the food was good at least.",91709

The hostesses looked like two bumbling idiots that had no common sense or courtesy by simply just giving us a updated time frame or even simple apology. That would of suffice for us to wait, but instead the hostess went and cleaned the window and walked passed us like we didn't exist, while the other one was calling out names for people that probably left for the same reason. After the 4th no show, she decided to skip us over and give the table over to the couple. That was it! I'm out this bitch! Got me waiting for no reason ...fuck you PF CHANG!

The hostess up front and the entire staff was really nice and helpful during our dinner. My biggest problem is that it seemed like most of our food portions got a lot smaller? I don't know if this is a change in the menu or not, but that is the first thing I did notice when our food was delivered to us. We ordered 4 dishes that night. It seemed like the orange chicken and the other chicken dish we got (forgot the name off the top of my head right now) really lacked in chicken.... I understand the outer ""shell"" of the chicken is fried, but it seemed like there was so much batter on it that there was a really small piece of chicken for the amount of fried batter that came on it. I haven't been here in a while, but from what I remember the ratio or chicken to fried batter was more equal than this. If I am in the area I might come back and give it a shot again, but for now these are just my thoughts of my last visit.",91709
972,"3445 Grand Ave Chino Hills, CA 91709",Rebecca O.,"Orange, CA",11/14/2014,3,"Generally, I like this chain.  We had lunch here recently, and while it was fine, it was not impressive.  I love the chicken lettuce wraps, and we enjoyed those.  The fried rice was just ok, and definitely not worth the $10 or so it cost.  The Shanghai Noodles were disgusting, and I would never order them again.  They were overcooked, had an odd flavor (almost like a spicy vinegar?), and contained overcooked cherry tomatoes, which were out of place in the dish.  My husband enjoyed the egg drop soup.  Service was average. The table was very cramped with two people, and I would recommend requesting a larger table if you plan to share food and/or order multiple entrees.",91709

The soup and the appetizer came out after about 10 mins. HOWEVER, the rest of our food came out 45 mins after. At exactly 10:06pm!!!! The place was not packed at all. When we asked our server why it took forever, he said "" well sometimes when its about closing time it gets a bit crazy in the kitchen and they just start cleaning up and lose their focus"" (perhaps referring to the cook/chef). What? Huh? Closing time? We came in at 9pm and they close at 11pm. This is not our first time here and it was never this bad even on a Sunday lunch when its really packed.

Both our dishes and the appetizer were great. The lo mein was delicious we couldn't stop raving over it. The noodles were perfectly done,meat was tender and flavorful also the wontons crispy and fresh. I forget my moms order lol it was a shrimp dish with melons it tasted good as well. Prior to this we hadn't visited pf for a long time so it was a nice meal. Fast forward a month and we order pretty much the same to go(pork lo mein,crab wontons) was my order as the last time. For some reason with Togo service it was not good at all. The lo mein was soggy so obviously had been sitting a while and the wontons were just ok. I expected the wontons to not be as great only because as a takeout order they aren't going to be piping hot by time you make it home. I'm still a fan just don't plan on ordering takeout from here again. I'll sit and eat when the craving strikes",91709

984,"3445 Grand Ave Chino Hills, CA 91709",Mark Darren W.,"Los Angeles, CA",8/15/2013,3,"I like PF Chang's.  I do.  For a chain restaurant, I've always like their food.  Fresh, delicious and certainly in enough quantity that no one complained about being skimped on their dish.So why the 3-Stars?  Well, this time, at this location, I was disappointed.  Food wise, I can be a creature of habit, especially when I'm hungry.  Facing such dire conditions, I seldom opt to experiment with food.  I like to get what I like and unleash as much devastation on it that you would have thought I was a former castaway on Gilligan's Island.  I'm not talking ""plate licking,"" but you get the picture. lolKeeping that in mind, I ordered for appetizers, the Salt & Pepper Calamari, Crispy Green Beans, and the Chang's Chicken Lettuce Wraps. Why so many? Well, we ""eats"" a lot. lolThe Salt & Pepper Calamari, as good as it was, looked like they pulled them from Jenny Craig's purchase list.  Small and super thin, but I devoured them.The Crispy Green Beans, were outstanding and plentiful. The Chicken Lettuce Wraps were what they are. Good.For the main course, we ordered the Salt & Pepper Prawns. And before I go any further, I don't want anyone thinking we're salt junkies. Far from it.  Enough so that as delicious as the prawns were, one tasted like they dropped a tub of salt on it.  That was disgusting.  This probably was an omen for the rest of the meal, but I wasn't thinking it would be.  Why should I? PF Chang's had never failed to be top notch before, so there were no worries.  I stand corrected.We had Chang's Spicy Chicken and let me tell you, it came as dry as it could be.  Clearly they were overcooked to the point of being little wooden chicken nuggets.  My son opted to push thru them in the beginning thinking a little dipping sauce could save them, but he was sorely mistaken.  Pushing the plate to the edge of the table signaled that he gave up.  Smart kid.  Wooden nuggets don't digest well.The fried rice was good, but I've had better.  It tasted just a wee bit oily.... Ok, there is no such thing as wee bit oily.  It was oily.  Too oily.Then my personal favorite.  The one dish that never failed to deliver.  The one that put the seal on PF Chang's being the place for me was the Shrimp in Lobster Sauce.  I like PF Chang's too much to be overly harsh here, but let me just reveal that Shrimp in Lobster Sauce should have some type of flavor, no?  I mean some, type of flavor, right?  Seriously, New Moon's Shrimp in Lobster Sauce is legendary.  Oops. Did I just mention New Moon?  The one in Downtown Los Angeles? I did huh? I'm sorry (wink, wink).I'm just going to chalk this experience up to the chef having a bad day.  A bad day to the point this location get's 3-Stars for it.By the way, the Strawberry/Lemonade was good!",91709
985,"3445 Grand Ave Chino Hills, CA 91709",Brian H.,"Fontana, CA",8/24/2013,2,"My wife and I have patronized this particular P.F. Changs for a while now, and I must say that we have seen a decline in both the food and the service.In terms of the menu, there have been several iterations recently.  It almost seems as if the management cannot decide what they wish to serve.  On our latest visit - last night - we were disappointed to discover that many of the dishes we generally ordered were no longer available.  I found it odd that a ""Chinese Bistro"" would offer sushi as part of its selection, but ok.  Cannot fathom, however, why they would abandon their Sichuan Shrimp, Dali Chicken, Cashew and Almond Chicken...and there were several more dishes summarily removed from the menu.More disheartening, however, was the noticeable decline in the service we received.  I need to be clear: I am not saying that anyone was rude.  Nothing like that.  However, during each of our past 3 visits, our food has either taken an extraordinarily long time to reach us or someone in the kitchen has screwed up the order.During this latest visit, we ordered pan-seared pork dumplings as part of our order.  When the server returned several minutes later with our drinks, we were informed that the kitchen had run out of the pork dumplings; they were making some from scratch.  In the meantime, the manager had offered a plate of chicken lettuce wraps until our dumplings arrived.  Nice.  But, after another 10 minutes, the pork dumplings arrived BEFORE the lettuce wraps.Additionally, my wife ordered a bowl of wanton soup.  When our meal arrived, the soup was not included.  When the server returned to check on us later, we asked her about the soup.  She checked on it.  Apparently the soup had indeed been made, but another server had taken it to fill HIS order.  She said that, since we were taking home part of our meal, she would make sure that a container of soup was included at no charge.  When she brought us our to-go bag, however, the soup was not there.Because of the series of mishaps with our dining experience, the manager also agreed to comp our drinks.  All in all, we saved about 35% on our meal, which was nice.  During our previous visit, we were actually discounted 50% of our meal.  Ultimately, however, while I do appreciate the management at P.F. Chang's attempting to make-up for mistakes on their part, I would much rather avoid such mistakes altogether.",91709

Had to wait 20 minutes for the ""tofu"" to come out, and it was actually beancurd, not soft tofu. No sauce AT ALL made the entire thing tasteless, hard, and downright inedible. However we got it on the house which made me feel a little bit better.The dessert (Banana Spring Rolls) was surprisingly delicious with pineapple ice cream, fresh fruit, and a bit too oily banana rolls, but after the first bite it became a little too rich and sweet. But even the dessert couldn't save my review of this place---it's so expensive, EVEN with THREE free entrees ($120? really?). Loved the service--our waiter was very friendly and kept joking with us and asking if we needed anything. The food, however, is probably the worst I've ever tasted at a restaurant with such fancy menus/atmosphere--either too salty, flavorless, undercooked, etc. Please do not call this Chinese food because I will cry.",91709

We had ordered the cucumber strawberry drink and added a shot of vodka. These were amazing.  I haven't been to PF changs in a long while. I was definitely surprised to see all the veggie options they had. My gf is veggie and she was happy to see those options as well. We ordered the veggie fried rice, a side of spinach, and the tofu curry. The tofu curry was surprisingly good. It didn't have that weird bland tofu flavor at all! We also really enjoyed veggie fried rice. It came with fresh broccoli and snap peas, (more veggies, I couldn't remember). It was my post-interview meal and I had told the bartender that and he surprisingly brought out one of those birthday cakes haha. It was awesome. I'm happy we had lunch there.",91709

My brother, parent's and I are all first timers and we all agreed we will definitely be coming back. We shared different dishes like sweet and sour chicken, honey chicken, walnut cantaloup shrimp, lin mein, etc. I myself am verg picky with chicken chinese dishes, and these really topped my expectations. We were very happy costumers. Why we liked the food? Not salty like many other restaurants, everything tasted so fresh, chicken was soft and moist, shrimp did not taste like it was overcooked. Our experience with service was also great. Hostess was very nice and our waitress was the best.   Mostly my 5 starts are because my mom was very happy with our food, and trust me when I say, she is very very picky with restaurants, this one is the first one she's liked in years!!!",91709

1004,"3445 Grand Ave Chino Hills, CA 91709",Christine G.,"Fontana, CA",4/6/2015,3,"First off, the food was wonderful.  No complaints whatsoever on the fare. My bad experience came from the service and my credit card being WAY overcharged. I am only giving 3 stars due to management's response to the problem. Otherwise it would have been 1 star.  All in all, despite it being probably the worst dining experience any of us had had service wise, we were celebrating a happy event and not inclined to complain until the problems with the checks happened.We came in on a Saturday evening as a 7 person party with a reservation.  We were seated immediately and that was the last of our short waits.  Drinks, appetizers and food all came out staggered with long waits in between.  3 of us had water while the other four were waiting for theirs.  Then two of our appetizers came out while the other one was still out.  By now we had been there nearly an hour.  When food came out, two of us were finished (not fast eaters) by the time everyone else got their entrees.  When two of the entrees that came with rice came out early, but without the rice, they had to wait about 10-15 minutes to get rice while their entrees got cold. There were also mistakes with 4 out of 7 entrees which lead to more wait times and staggered dishes. There was only one person at our table who made a special request, that her entree be half boxed when brought to the table, which was ignored. We also received side orders in opposite portions of what was ordered.  i.e. asked for a small side of asparagus, received large. Which we were told we would not be charged for the large and we were anyway.Around the time desserts were being ordered, management came by to see how we were doing.  We told him nicely about the spotty service we were getting and he explained that our server was new and that he would comp us a free dessert to make up for it.  That dessert came out immediately.  And was finished for probably 10-15 minutes by the time the other two deserts that had already been ordered arrived.  By now it was nearly 8 PM and we had sat down at 5.When the checks came (3 total), we were overcharged for things we had not ordered, charged for the large side and charged for the ""comped"" dessert. We asked that the checks be fixed.  When they were brought back, they had not all been fixed.  I gave my card to the waiter for my portion of the bill which had been corrected and went outside to wait for the others while they settled up.  When the rest of my party came out they said they felt better about the whole experience because the manager had waived our checks.  I thought about going back in to ask for mine (the only one who had presumably paid) to be comped as well, haha, but thought better of it.  After all I had eaten what I paid for.  By happenstance, I checked my banking app as we got into the car and saw I had three charges totaling over $120 from PF Chang's.  I got out and went back in to find out what happened since my check had only been $20 something. The manager explained that the ""new guy"" had misunderstood and run my card for 2/3 of our party. I was told they would void the charges and it would be back in my account within one business day.  This was Saturday night, it is now Monday evening and the charges remain, though they have just assured me over the phone that my bank is probably just processing it and it should drop off tomorrow. In the end to compensate for the bad service and problems with my credit card, the manager offered me a $50 gift card on top of the already voided meal.  So in essence they paid me to eat there and then some which is why I've given three stars. Note to management: ""New guys"" who can't expedite larger parties or properly run the register shouldn't be scheduled on busy weekend evenings and given 7 head tables. I'll be back to use the gift card but that's probably it.  I don't blame the waiter, I blame management for poor training and scheduling.",91709

Since we were a party of six we asked if she would do three checks which she was amenable to do. I saw this person who was dressed differently from the staff filling water glasses. She came to our table and filled the water glasses so I asked if she was the general manager. I was very impressed to see Carla, the GM, willing to jump in. And she said whatever needs to be done she was willing to get her hands dirty.

Who came up with the layout of the interior? It's like eating in a cafeteria with some decent furniture. Sam was great. Cameron the  manager came out & comp'd us for the salad. Go elsewhere for trendy Chinese food! Panda Express is honestly much better for the food, the variety & something resembling ""Pan-Asian"" food.

Beyond that he wasn't very attentive even though there were only a handful of tables occupied. When it came time to pay our bill we gave our card and around 15 minuets later he came back saying there was computer errors. That sounded strange so we immediately checked our bank account and we had a pending charge of $117.00 when our bill was only $83.00. We called him and a manager back to explain. The manager, Luis, couldn't explain why there was an extra $30 charge only that it would not go through even though we could already see the pending charge in our account.

The way it was brought?  The waiter reaches in, in front of my face as I'm eating to set it down, when he could've took two steps over and placed it nicely without being in my face. On top of that, I was the one who had to stop from eating my rapidly cooling soup to move things around for him to set down the plate, when he had a free hand to do this. We weren't even 1/3rd through our main meal when the dessert menu was rudely set between us, and less then ten minutes later we were rushed to try and pick a dessert. The waiter had a very passive aggressive attitude about him as well, and was making faces and had a rude tone to his voice. The pad thai we had could've tasted a lot better, but the honey shrimp were amazing. When we received the check back, I was only given my dollar amount back and not the change portion of my receipt.... So I left no tip, he can keep the handful of change. I was also annoyed he had the nerve to circle the gratuity portion marked at $7.17, and brought me all ones instead of a $5, and three $1. Just was one God awful experience here with the help...

The orange chicken and almond cashew chicken were very tasty , but the service and experience were the best part of our dinner. GREAT JOB PF CHANGS!",91709

When the food came out, I couldn't help but to shake my head and chuckle. It was basically overpriced Panda Express (and I HATE Panda Express!) on dinner plates. I was not even disappointed because I knew all along this was exactly what I had imagined. This is why I avoid this restaurant (and anything similar to PF Chang's and Panda Express--oh, only difference being the plates.)

On the other hand the service was good, our waitress and servers were on the ball, kept our drinks full and she was very friendly. I go out to eat to enjoy delicious food which is more important to me than service but a good combination of the 2 will keep me coming back, hence the 3 star rating for now.

Now, I remembered why we never went back after the first time. It was because the food costs a lot compared to other authentic Asian restaurants and the servings are small for what you pay for. Coming from the SGV , we are spoiled with great tasting Asian restaurants for an affordable price. I received gift cards for X'mas so I had to use it up today . Hence, I had to come back here. We didn't have a wait staff after being seated for 15 mins so we had to flag someone who walked by. She claimed she wasn't our wait staff and that she had to find that person but came back and claimed she doesn't know who it is but will get our orders anyways. Our utensils were dirty and one had rice in it even! Eeeewww! We ended up using the chopsticks instead. Then , my family ordered a beef dish. When the food came, the beef dish looked like a veggie dish loaded with scallions and the. Ref looked like sparse toppings!!! Wth! NEVER AGAIN!

ABC, American Born Chinese. A banana, yellow outsite but white inside. Everyone already knows that this place is just a Chinese restaurant thats been Americanized. But what everybody doesn't know is that this isn't good Chinese food.How did I end up here? Well, the wife had a coupon and gift card so we had to use them. It wasn't too busy so we got seated quickly by a very friendly staff. I really liked the restaurant decor and the comfy booths. We ordered from their prix fixe menu for 2. For $39, you get soup, 1 appetizer,  2 entrees and 2 desserts. We had the Mongolian beef and Honey shrimp along with our Egg drop soup and Hot and sour soup. I remember that their Chicken lettuce wraps appetizer was one of the better ones and it was probably the best dish we had. The soups were simply aweful. The egg drop lacked any flavor and the hot and sour soup was practically BLACK. It tasted like soy sauce and vinegar soup. Stay away from the Mongolian beef. Waaaay too salty and soaked in soy sauce.It took us hours to get the salt sting out of our mouths. The honey shrimp was like something you'd get a Panda Express. Soggy and it had that old flavor and texture to it. For dessert, we chose the red velvet cake and smores. They come in little shot glass sizes. The red velvet was quite good. If you like sweet, I mean crazy sweet, then the smores might be what you want to get. Service was amazingly good. Our wattress was attentive and effecient. Probably the best service we've experienced in a long time. We don't ever make a fuss about the food, but we mentioned to her our issues and she immediately got her manager who was equally fantastic. They will offer to remake it for you if it doesn't come out well. Here's a tip:If you don't see Asians eating here, than it probably means it's not very good.",91709

This was my first time to pfchangs and  I heard from another mate that this place was disgusting. That being said I didn't have high expectations. I ended up ordering the Mongolian beef plate. I think I got more veggies than meat.  My other mate ordered a chicken salad that came with no chicken. We told our waitress and ended up getting another salad with seared tuna I think ( not to sure:all I know it was another salad lol). It was just okay.  The birthday boy got a ginger beer that never came because they ran out of the ingredients but we were still charged for it. We ended complaining about it. It was shortly fixed right after. The portions are very small here. I ended up leaving still hungry and went to In N Out that night. That being said I will never ever ever ever come back.,91709

The bar is loaded with drinks and they have like two tv screens at the bar. TASTE: we ordered the calamari appetizer and it was a bit salty. I wish they lessen the salt next time we come back. And we also ordered the friend rice and their beef. I forgot the names, Cz the taste caught me. All I could remember was the taste. And it was good!! Good job PFChangs! I ordered tea which was the dragon oolong peach.. Something within those lines. And that was good too. I wouldnt order that next time cz I think I could make it on my own.

Way too salty, and the shrimp really could have been any form of meat and the dish would have tasted the same.  We probably went through five glasses of water a piece and still had the saltiness in our mouths.Great Wall of Chocolate - finished off the meal with this six-layer cake.

Out of the 3 times I have visited this location I have had problems 2 times. The first time in April I had placed a phone order and the gentleman took about 20 minutes to get my order into the system (I only ordered 3 dishes) because he had to ask if they could substitute chicken for tofu (which they can because they do it at all locations)...I specifically told him I wanted to make sure there was no meat or eggs in the vegetarian dish and he confirmed. Then when I got there I had to wait 25 minutes longer than what I was told and when I went home I realized my order had meat and eggs and had to return to have this corrected. After speaking to a manager I was refunded my entire meal and given the proper dish. I had paid for the meal with a gift card so he gave me money back on a gift card. Two months later we returned to eat again. Our waitress was AMAZING. The food took forever to come out...when the appetizers finally came out we got full off of those and couldn't even enjoy our entrées since they took so long to come out.  We gave they waitress the gift card to pay for our meal (the gift card hadn't left the house since the day we got it). We were then told that there was no money on it and we told her she had to be mistaken. Manager pulled up the history on the card and confirmed it was issued at that location but used a month after issued in Memphis! We waited for a while before the manager told us he was doing us a ""favor"" by issuing a new gift card for the same amount to pay the meal. I'm sorry that your company either issued another gift card with the same number and amount or that there was a glitch or you guys got hacked...it was your fault, so no you weren't doing us a ""favor"". We wasted so much time here today and missed our plans for after dinner. Wish we could have been treated better so we could come back here.",91709

Yesterday evening 01/19/15 6:30pm We decided to sit in the bar area, bar top to be exact. There seemed to be no bartender working because it took 20 min for someone to even acknowledge us and ask us for our drink order. After we finally got our drink orders in, it took another 20 min for anyone to ask us if we had any questions regarding the menu or if we wanted to place an order. There was another man sitting at the bar who seemed to be a regular customer because the Male manager had a 15 min conversation with him about nothing instead of checking to see who was taking care of us or if we needed to place an order. The manager glanced over and saw that we were ready but kept on with his conversation, uninterested in us.  Poor management skills at it's best here. The manager finally came over to us, after he made an attempt to walk away and asked if we needed anything. We ordered a soup then he walks off to put it in the computer, and then we never see him again. We weren't even done ordering our entree's. It just goes to show that if you have a leader (Manager) who doesn't care about the customers and customer service, how do you expect the crew and servers to care?!?!",91709
1101,"3445 Grand Ave Chino Hills, CA 91709",Andrea X.,"Manhattan, NY",12/25/2012,3,"After a few months of not coming back here for a while, my family and I decided to have Christmas Eve dinner here, and was reminded why we haven't gone back in a while. First of all: it is extremely overpriced for the quality and quantity of food you are getting. We started off with the chicken lettuce wrap appetizer, which is something we always get and has always been consistently good. This time was no different: the lettuce leaves were nice and crispy, and the dish itself was good. For a family of five, we ordered quite a bit: mongolian beef, hot fish, mu shu pork, crispy honey shrimp, and double-pan fried noodles. All of these dishes were extremely salty, and if this is coming from a girl who loves salty foods, then you know it must have been really salty. The hot fish dish was the favorite among the five of us--the saltiness did the fish just right, and it had a very unique flavor. I felt that the restaurant used cheap cuts of beef for the mongolian beef, and the honey shrimp tasted as if the Changs bought a jar of store-bought sauce and dumped it over frozen shrimp. I didn't try the pan fried noodles because it looked as if it was stuck into a microwave and presented to us. I think my entire family and I were the most disappointed with the mu shu pork: there were hardly any pieces of meat, and the vegetables that were used for the dish were all 'cheap vegetables'--meaning, mainly cabbage. If I could, I would give this place 2.5 stars, mainly for the service.",91709

When it comes to entrees the honey chicken or the crispy beef (not on the menu cooks specialty) are solid choices and plenty for 2 especially if u get a appetizer.

We ordered the Kaleidoscope Roll which was loose and broke apart when picked up.3. We ordered an order of 6 fried pork dumplings and 4 steamed dumplings. He brought two plates of fried dumplings and left before we could say anything. He returned much later and when told, said, ""aren't they steamed?"" as if he could fool us into thinking it was correct. We told him the brown/black grill marks on the dumpling pretty much give it away.  4. He took the fried dumplings.  This is the first time I've even seen a server take an incorrect order from the table instead of just leaving it there, especially after it had been sitting at our table for about 5 minutes.  Then I saw him carry it around the restaurant all over the place, and I finally lost sight of him behind a different part of the dining room. Later, he randomly came to our table with a plate of pad thai and asked us if we wanted it.  We said no.  He said, ""Ok... I was going to give it to for free.""  Big whoop.  I am guessing he did the same with the wrong fried dumplings, offering to other tables to score some tip points.5. The steamed dumplings came out immediately before the entrees.  In fact, the entrees were being put on the table when I BIT INTO IT AND THE MEAT WAS COLD!  I had to spit it out.  It's PORK and it was COLD.  Yuk.  I told the waiter and he said he'll take it off the bill like he was doing us a huge favor.6.

Such a poor attitude from the RCA location.  We actually changed our reservations although we had to drive 30 min.  It was well worth it!  The staff at the CH location were just super! They were extremely accommodating and actually made us feel welcome. While my expectation was not very high (because of my experience just with the attitude of the RC restaurant,  I really didn't expect the best, while I understand  that having a large party is not always easy and can be challenging. We were celebrating my daughters HS graduation and I must say we had excellent service, timely ordered food, and I was surprised how good the food actually was.  Most  important the staff made our evening, from the receptionist, server,  to the manager, they were all superb!  I am a very picky foodie and not afraid to let the establishment know when something is wrong, however, I just had to share how wonderful our dinning experience was for such an important celebration.

Don't expect authentic chinese food, or too many healthy options here...the food is totally americanized, usually greasy, and always keeps me coming back. they currently have a 2 for $39.95 special which i HIGHLY RECOMMEND! it really is a great deal, but you have to be STARVING to really enjoy it. here's what you get-2 soups -1 appetizer-2 main entrees-2 bowls of rice-2 mini dessertsHere is the breakdown on what i got:Soup 3/5: I got the hot&sour soup, but the other option is egg drop. I like soup to begin with so it already got points there. but the soup is a lil too thick for my liking and maybe a bit too sour. Appetizer 5/5: the salt & pepper calamari is really what keeps me coming back to PF Changs. I am not a huge fried calamari fan, but i would say this is my favorite place to eat it. You also get a LOT -- a decent appetizer for 3-4 people.Main entree: 3/5: I got Chang's spicy chicken, which i always think is okay, but better than any other chicken dish on the menu. again, the plus is you get a lot but it's really not as spicy as they make it out to be.dessert: 3/5: I tried the chocolate mousse. i have to give the place credit for creativity...they somehow managed to squeeze in dessert into a shot glass, making it the perfect size for an individual dessert. butttt, the desserts i've tried over my several visits heres, are always wayy to heavy. i'm more of a chocolate souffle sort of gal (in which case, i HIGHLY recommend you try it out at yardhouse right next door)service: 4/5: the waiters are usually nice, and attentive. no complaints here.sooo overall, 3.5. ehh, not feelin too gracious so i'll round down.",91709

Changs. My boyfriend and I love to have dinner here because we can walk around the shopping area after having our dinner. Unfortunately, the last dinner we had was totally awful. They made 3 mistakes. The first mistake is, there was RAW chicken on our starter Salt and Pepper Calamari. I am not a clean freak. However, for some people, this is really unacceptable. Chicken always need special treatment since it is considered one of the ""dangerous"" food if it is not handled properly. It can make people, especially kids and elderly ones, sick easily. The raw chicken was on the side of the plate, which was really easy to be seen. Where was the food expeditor? The front-of-house manager asked us if we would like to get another starter, the same one, or just cancel it. We decided to order the same one since that is the only starter we both enjoy. The second mistake is, we got charged with 2 calamari starters. This mistake was not totally our server's fault. The manager should have informed our server. Our server also should have had better communication with the manager. At the end, the manager decided to take the calamari off our bill. And, I believe that it was the most appropriate thing to be done because P.F. Chang is a big restaurant. The cost of the food is really low. The cost of unsatisfied guests is expensive. And, it is part of delivering good customer service. The third mistake is, we didn't get fortune cookies. It might not be looked as a huge mistake. However, consistent service is good for a company.",91709

There were a few problems with our order but the manager was so nice he took it off the bill. First the kids meal we ordered was the fried rice instead of the chicken dippers. When we ordered the honey sauce we got the sweet and sour instead. Luckily my son didn't care and ate it anyway. I ordered the northern style ribs which is dry but we got the southern ribs which is a wet sauce. It was quickly fixed and we received the southern ribs on the house. We also ordered the Lemongrass chicken salad but it arrived without chicken, I didn't figure it out till the end because the receipt said chicken, and my hubby ordered for me while I was in the restroom. I thought maybe I was mistaken and the salad was vegetarian. Either way the salad was yummy and the manager explained it could be ordered either way with or without chicken. At the end I ordered the gluten free flourless chocolate cake, the server was confused and thought I meant the chocolate dome. The manager helped the confusion and said it was really gluten free. Either way I felt really bad for the server and just wanted to leave! The manager offered to fix up the Chicken salad real quick on the house to take home but we refused.

First of all I have to say that this is really not a chinese restaurant, its a very Americanized version of it. I used to be apprehensive about eating here because in my experience, mass chain restaurants have not really delivered. However, its a nice classy place for 20 somethings to hang out so we decided to go. The service was great, the servers were very nice and they were helpful without being smothering.We ordered a total of 7 dishes. We began with the dan dan noodles, it came in a very large bowl with a lot of noodles. The noodles were very chewy and flavorful. It was spicy with a hint of sweetness to it so it was very enjoyable. Next was the pepper steak and although the beef was tender and cooked perfectly, it was way to salty. Not even overly peppered but just incredibly salty, you can only swallow if you had rice. We got two lamb dishes, wok-seared lamb and chengdu spiced lamb and both were delicious. The chengdu spiced lamb was cooked in a dark spicy sauce and it was really good. The wok-seared lamb is less strongly flavored but it was still a bold taste without over doing it. Next we got the shrimp with candied walnuts, a very standard and traditional chinese dish. The shrimps were very large and each was perfectly battered and fried and then dipped in the sweet mayonnaise sauce and served with candied walnuts, it was delicious. Then we got the lemongrass prawns served with garlic noodles, this was another dish that was too salty. The noodles were good but not very chewy and then broke easily. Lastly we got the double-pan fried noodles. It also came in a large bowl and it was good, nothing amazing but it was good.Overall I liked this place, each plate averaged about $10 or so for lunch, which is quite reasonable. The decor of the place is also very nice and its a very clean restaurant. It has a sophisticated feel good for business lunches. I do recommend this place.",91709

And the last time we were here, I think the bartender may have been new because he made the wrong drink for a table (he made a pomegranate martini by mistake) so our waiter brought it to our table and said it was complementary; yay! Then my father in law ordered a Fat Tire and the waiter brought the wrong beer (not his fault, the label looked identical and by this point we were convinced the bartender was new). He didn't realize it was the wrong beer until he poured it. He gave it to my husband and when he informed the waiter when he came back, he gave us that beer for free and brought the right one! There's always plenty of parking and if you're there during the day, there's a few stores that you can go browse around in before/after your meal. Win win!",91709

I've been here three times in the last two months, and always order the same thing:LoMein noodles with beef and chicken,Crab Won-tons and Iced tea! Those I believe are their best items. My brother once ordered these crunchy noodles that were totally disgusting, and my mom orders the shrimp with glaze on them, which was so so to me. When I went with my friend, she ordered the lettuce wraps which were so so as well! They're okay,not great but alright if you want some decent Chinese food.

B or C rating (B for Best, C for Chinese, A is for Americanized)2. No Asian decorations (That crap is to fool non-Chinese)3. No booths, just as many tables cramped into a dining room.4. Usually no alcohol served.5. No table cloth6. Lastly, no fortune cookies.  If they give you that at the end of your meal, it's not a real Chinese restaurant.",91709

Had to ask for that, and sugar for my tea, a clean plate and refills.  The server was terrible. The 3 ""managers"" (young ladies) dressed in jeans and just didn't look professional.   They were busy looking through the restaurant and high 5ving the bus boys.  Meanwhile we needed drink refills.  Plus the lettuce wrap recipe has changed and they no longer bring the hot mustard, chili sauce and the other brown sauce to the table  to mix it.  It's prepared already so you have to ask for hot mustard and chili sauce only to have the waiter say ""we don't make it that way, but okay I can bring it to you"".  Seriously this location used to be our favorite place.  Have to try Victoria Gardens now, hopefully PF Changs will consider this review and make some changes in Chino Hills.",91709

Had to send the Mongolia beef back twice after it arrived lukewarm. This left me with no food for a total of about a half hour. Even with the manager's attention, the kitchen staff couldn't serve the one item properly. Other food orders served at the table included hot-and-sour soup and shrimp fried rice and were good but not great. Waiters were few and far between. They appear to have been congregating in back or just spread too thin. Our waitress stopped by every twenty minutes or so and was nearly impossible to track down for problems and drink refills. It was hard to even find someone else's server to ask our server to come to the table. The manager was nice when we finally saw her and she  made an accommodation on the bill. However, I rather would have paid full price and received good service and food, even if it took them two tries to get it right. With so much time elapsed the other person I was eating with was finished and I was left to leave hungry with cold food to box up and take home. There appears to be a large management problem here. I hope they can resolve it so I can give the restaurant another try. There are so many other establishments in Chino and surrounding areas that have far better service and food. Sadly, you can have a better experience at places charging half as much, although I would rather pay more for a better experience.",91709

It's what a white man would say ""mm this Chinese food taste good"" but to an Asian this place has a nice atmosphere but the food is way too salty. I've been here before and I don't remember it being so salty but the last time I went I swear the chef just decided to drown everything in soy sauce or salt. I got the sea bass which I had before and loved..but this time it was way too salty...the spinach was so salty it was inedible. The Kung Pao chicken was so salty we ended up taking it home and putting it in a stir fry the next day. We also ordered honey walnut shrimp and that was probably the only thing edible.

We wanted to try something new for my husband's birthday and we're sorry we did. The food we ordered was awful. Everything,  We thought, was overly sauced. It made our Hunan-style Hot Fish extremely salty and a real turn-off. Also, the presentation of the food was not at all appealing, nor appetizing. The chicken that was part of the lettuce wrap was mixed with, again, a sauce that resembled some stew like mix. Can't say that we have ever seen lettuce wrap with stuffing like that. Other dishes like the Dan Dan Noodles was the worst dish of all. The ramen noodles was so over cooked and the way it was presented.. sorry, was the worst presentation of a noodle dish we've seen. It simply looked like mush. The Pad Thai dish was not true authentic Thai taste, but it was ok compared to the other dishes we ordered.  It was depressing meal for my family.  Also, we went during Happy Hour. They wouldn't allow us to order Happy Hour items in the dining are. You have to sit in the bar or outside.

Chang a long time.  We got Dynamite Shrimp, Pad Thai with Shrimp,  Fried Rice,  and Cheese Cake. The food was good.  The service  was excellent,  let explain why, our server was George, when he 1st car to our table he look like he had a lot on his mind,  then Ivan came to our table to help and explain why he came, to help George out because George is the bartender too. Now, I realize why George was looking like that, because he had a lot on his plate that day.  I appreciate him his service he was and I know still is a hard working man. Besides that when George came to my table asking me if I wanted to take or if I was done.  I told him yeah meaning to take. My daughter said he thought you meant to take and throw it away. I went looking for him to tell him I wanted my food.  Well another waiter found George to tell him.  George said, they found him to late bcuz he threw the food way, BUT... I got the cook to make you a whole new one. That's what you call good service. George is on top of his game.  So I was to say, P.F. Chang has some great employees that know how to provide great service, George and Ivan,  Ivan kept coming to our table asking is there anything else I can do for you, and most of all Ivan kept our glasses refilled, that's EXCELLENT. ...

Chang's is located at the El Paso mall, upstairs, aright above the soon to open Great Maple.Wanting to redeem an old gift card that was given to me as a gift, I decided to make an order online. I have never had P.F. Chang's before and had the impression that it serves Americanized Chinese food (and it does). After making my order online, I drove out to this location to pick up my order. I ended up getting:Family meal for 4 which came with the following:*Chang's Chicken Lettuce Wrap- From what I have read online, seems like the lettuce wraps are one of the best items recommended to order. I have to agree that this was probably the best thing in our family meal. I liked the chicken, water chestnuts and sauce in the chicken. I also liked that the chicken was separated from the iceberg lettuce.   *Egg Drop Soup- I opted for this soup and thought it was average. It is a really large portion and plenty for a family of 4.  *Chicken Lo Mein- This was super oily and thought it was just average. I don't know if I would say the portion was good for 4 though.    *Sesame Chicken- I ordered this with brown rice (at no additional charge, but you can also opt for white rice if you prefer). I thought this was also very average. I felt that the chicken was too soft and the sauce probably should have been sweet but would have preferred it to be more savory.  *Beef with Broccoli- I also ordered this with brown rice. Again, very average in taste. But I did like that there was a good ratio of broccoli to beef though.  -------------------------- (Total= $57.33 after tax)When I arrived, I waited at the hostess booth for a while before an employee saw me. This employee was serving one party outside (this restaurant is open for outdoor seating, which is covered). He had to get an employee to ring me up as he went back into the kitchen to get my order. This employee that rang me up was just sitting in the bar the whole time, drinking her beverage and looking down on her cell phone. Overall, thought the food was very average at best, just like Panda Express but more expensive. In fact, I actually think Panda Express taste better, which isn't much to say because both are very Americanized Chinese food. I don't see myself coming back here.",91101

The service was exceptional-- our server asked us a few times about how we were doing, gave us new plates for entrees after appetizers, and boxed our take-out for us. The food deserves four stars. Both appetizers I ordered were delicious. The fried calamari was better than the lettuce wraps. The calamari was fried in a unique batter, the batter was crunchy and seasoned. The best entree is the oolong marinated sea bass. The fish was perfectly steamed and the marinade was so savory. I'm glad I ordered that over the salmon dish. I definitely recommend it to anyone who likes seafood!",91101

It's conveniently located in the mall in Downtown Burbank which was very close to work.I signed up for their mailing list so I always receive a BOGO free coupon via email. I usually use it during lunchtime with a coworker. I love their lettuce wraps and Kung pao chicken. However, the Burbank location closed down so the nearest one to me is the Pasadena location. Armed with a BOGO coupon, I decided to revisit. I initially had a hard time finding it but realized later on its on the second floor of Paseo Colorado next to the elevator.The place is quite big but was almost empty when I dropped by during happy hour. Other than me, there was one other table occupied with a group of three.The hostess wasn't very friendly but my server was. He tried everything he could to provide good service. However, I was disappointed with the food. I had the chow mein and tofu stir fry and a side of brown and white rice.I might have just ordered the wrong dish and should have just ordered my favorites. I'm pretty sure though that I had their chow mein in the past and it was pretty good. This one came over cooked and soggy. Same with the stir fried vegetables.

Anything else had to be requested. Speaking of request. The server seemed like a sweet girl but she had no sense of urgency or personality when it came to anything. She could barely make eye contact and everything she did was in SLOW motion. My husband waited at least 10 minutes for a pelligrino and mind you there were only about 8 groups of people in the restaurant. Don't go here hungry!! The food takes forever even though it was fairly empty at around 3:00pm on a Saturday. As far as the food it was good. No complaints there except for the face that they bring you the smallest bowl of white rice ever to go with all your dishes. You can request more.

The only thing worse than bad service is fake service. Do servers not know that customers can tell when they are being fake nice ?

This was expected because of the food, service and the restaurant itself. Well, since it was a day that was not too warm with a healthy breeze, it seemed like a good day to get reacquainted with P.F.

We requested to sit on the patio as the new booths looked inviting. We got seated after waiting less than 5 minutes. It should be mentioned that the hostess was very attentive. She felt that it was taking for the table she was giving us to be cleaned up and she took a rag to clean it herself! Got seated and WOW , the upholstery to the bench seats needed extra FOAM! So the rest of the meal was more of the same - a combination of highs and lows.  Food - just okay based on my memory of the dishes we would devour. We loved it so much that we would have dinners and lunches at least 2-3 times per month. But what.bothered me was how the dishes were plated. The corners of the plates were not wiped off. In fact, the outside surface of the soup bowl had dried out piece of a leaf! Space - aside from the lack of cushioning, a couple of tables was left uncleared and the floor of the patio area had pieces of plastic wrapper, paper wrappers and receipts. Service - our server was excellent. He even packed out left overs. I am mentioning this since I saw another server just give his table empty containers and a bag. I advocate for managing expectations. And this experience was just okay, maybe mostly because it is no up to par to the pleasant experiences we've had in the past.",91101

I came with an invitation to try their new Chicken Pad Thai free of charge with an order of an entree at regular price. I was at Paseo Colorado for a screening at the ArcLight Cinema, so it was convenient. My friend and I sat on the balcony to enjoy the fresh air and view as the inside seating was quite dark and stuffy. Their new recipe Chicken Pad Thai was just okay. Why would a Chinese restaurant have a Thai specialty, I don't know, but the regular entree we ordered was Pepper Steak and was plain awful. Way too salty and the random sized bits of steak were fried and smothered in sauce. I managed to find just three small pieces that were identifiable as beef, the others were so thin and over cooked from frying I have to wonder what Chinese culinary training the chef had if any. I did not enjoy writing this review, I use to dine here more often when they first opened years ago. I am also aware that the PF Chang's restaurants are not Chinese owned and that's okay, but you would think they might have their act together after so many years.",91101

Our waiter did apologize, but problem is people get very hangry when they have to wait two hours for entrees, refill their own water, and flag down a server, so I feel like P.F.

Ehh, complete failure.  The honey walnut shrimp at Panda Express is better.  Why the Panda comparison?

1262,"300 E Colorado Blvd Ste 218 Pasadena, CA 91101",John L.,"Los Angeles, CA",5/15/2020,1,"I am writing about my horrible experience so people can know what to expect for pre-orders for pick up. I had ordered mother's day dinner earlier in the day and had placed the order in advance to be ready for pick up upon arrival. I had set the time for 5:30 pm since I had made dinner plans with my family for 6 pm. Upon arrival, I paid for my order and then the waiting game began. I will spare the details of the frustration but was never told hold long to expect for the wait and was just told to have a seat and wait for my name to be called so was expecting it to be out quickly. The staff let me know that it would be out shortly but has continuously left waiting. By the time I had received my order, it was 6:25. That is ridiculous to wait that long for an order especially being the fact that I had placed the order earlier in the day so the staff should have been prepared to have the food ready as requested. If the order could not be filled out time, I would expect that they would have known in advance and notified me sooner that the food would be delayed. Also, if knowing the food would be delayed, the least they could have done is given the courtesy heads up upon arrival that the order was going to be out in an hour so I could do other things around the area. The whole time, I had my wife and mother in law waiting in the car since I had no expectation on when the food would be out. I have visited PF Changs a number of times and had always had good experiences and this is the first time that I have had such a horrible experience. This was the first time to this location as I typically go to the Santa Monica location. If choosing to order again, I will make sure not to order from this store and go back to the Santa Monica location.",91101

It was basically empty yet the hostess told us that she would have to find us a table and set it up - give me a break! Did I say the restaurant was basically empty?Most of the dishes that we ordered tonight were served almost warm. We didn't say anything until the fried rice dishes were delivered and they were cold. We had to tell the manager who immediately and gladly said that he would replace them with dishes that were hot. That was very nice however he never returned to determine whether the food that was replaced was to our liking. This is a major managerial error.

I recently came to this location for dinner and found the food to be pretty good but the service rather sucky.We sat outside in the patio which is a nice area on the second floor. We were seated immediately but it took 10 minutes for our waiter to come by. In the past I always liked their chicken lettuce wraps so gave that as an appetizer order. We also ordered sweet & sour pork and Mongolian beef.The lettuce wraps were great. There's something about the cool, crisp lettuce around that warm mixture of chicken, mushroom, green onions and water chestnuts that I really enjoy. The sweet & sour pork was tender but I was surprised at the minimal pieces (4) of pineapple. The Mongolian beef was a winner - the very tender pieces of beef had a delicious glaze on them. I'd definitely order this again.Unfortunately our waiter vanished after taking our initial order. Our food was brought to us by other staff. We were never asked how our food was nor was my glass of iced tea, empty since receiving our appetizer, ever refilled. About 15 minutes after we were done eating, sitting with empty plates in front of us, he reappeared to ask if we were finished with our meal. The bad service nearly made me leave 2 stars but I'm in a good mood today.",91101

I love doing the Chang's for two, it comes with 2 soups (egg drop or hot n sour), an appetizer, 2 entrees and a shared desert. Its the perfect amount of food to share with your date and both of you have a little to take home. I dont get a soup for myself because I only eat seafood and the soups have chicken/beef in them but it's enough food in all so I dont even notice. My favorite appetizer has always been the dynamite shrimp. It's DYNAMITE!! Is it bad that out of everything, I look forward to the appetizer??! Sooooooo good. This last time we also tried the tempura cauliflower and it was AMAZING. The sauce was spicy and sooo thick, I could eat that alone over a bed of rice easily. I was glad I tried something new! For entrees the kung pao shrimp is yummy. The shrimp are big and they use a loooot of peanuts. It comes with white or brown rice. The lo mein is yummy too but it's very greasy!! Not the best thing to order if you're counting calories. But it is worth the splurge. Lastly, You have to order the banana spring rolls. I've had them elsewhere but at PF Changs they're the best. And the coconut ice cream..ugh. I wish I could buy the ice cream by the gallon. Buut it's probably better that I cant. At the end of your meal they package and bag all your leftovers. Every server I have had here has been awesome and attentive. PS- they validate parking!",91101

Some Chinese Americans say that this is not authentic Chinese food. With due research, I cannot agree. I was born and raised in China and moved to the US in my late 20's. Chinese food is diverse and different across provinces or regions ( Don't forget China is a HUGE country with diverse cultures!) and it is difficult to define what is authentic or not. What I would recommend to eat here: Mongolian beef, beef a la Sichuan, orange chicken, General Tao Chicken, and the crispy green beans! Every time I ate at PF Chang I gorged like a pig.  PF Chang is one of my favorite Chinese foods in addition to my hometown food ( Hmong and Kamese foods from China)",91101

Timing of the food from the appetizer was spot on.Ordered Gluten free lettuce wraps, regular beef and broccoli for the husband andGluten free Chang's chicken. Saucy and good portions this time, worth the money.So why 3 star?For some odd reason it gave me bubble guts and my husband who ate off the regular menu, the beef and broccoli, came home throwing up and diarrhea. After all the improvement and great experience we had I'm so disappointed again.

It is very sweet though, so if you are not very into sweet things I would suggest you order this. Another favorite was the honey chicken because it was very tender and very well seasoned. Again, this was a sweeter dish so if you do not really favor the sweet then I would suggest you choose another chicken dish.

It's been 10 years since I've had PF Chang's. After debate with the menu, and suggestions from our server we decided to go with Chang's dinner for 2 at $42. This meal deal included your choice of hot and sour or egg drop soup, 1 appetizer, 2 entrees, and a fried banana roll to split for dessert. My friend and I split the chicken lettuce wraps as our starter, and ordered two entrees which included Mongolian beef and Kung Pao Chicken with brown rice. The egg drop soup was delicious and served hot. I found the soup light and full of flavor. The soup was seasoned just right without that sodium kick you get from miso soup. For our starter, we split their chicken lettuce wraps. The sautéed chicken was served hot on a bed of rice noodles, while the lettuce buns were served chilled. The chicken wasn't sodium city and the flavor was marinated inside just right. Delish. I recommend trying the chicken lettuce wraps if you're considering dining with the Chang's. The entrees we ordered were disappointing. The Mongolian Beef was on the salty side, while the Kung Pao Chicken was quite the opposite. The chicken lacked flavor and was cooked dry. The Mongolian Beef was rubbery, salty, and over cooked. Rice was necessary to cut through the salt. For dessert we split their fried banana roll served with ice cream and strawberries. The fried banana was unripe and bland while the ice cream mixed with toasted coconut served with fresh strawberries was by far the best thing on the menu! If you're considering dessert skip the fried banana roll and ask for a scoop of ice cream with strawberries. Oh, I almost forgot. Iced Teas at the Chang's should be avoided at all costs. Our iced teas were served 90% tea and 10% ice. Disgusting. My iced tea was so concentrated that I had to dilute it with water. I know it's a pain in the rear end having to refill iced tea. But who wants 10% ice in their iced tea? On a slow day, I expected better service. PF Chang's is on the pricier side. Our server was friendly, helpful with the menu, but lazy. It's the smallest details in service that make a difference. After yesterday, I won't be dining at the Chang's ever again. It wasn't worth the food, ambience, service, nor money spent.",91101

We had a P.F Chang's gift card, and were in Pasadena for some shopping, so we decided to check out this location past weekend. **Why the wait?!?! ... We were quoted a wait time of half hour, so we stood uncomfortably in the super tight waiting area along with two other small parties. We were all wondering why we needed to wait as we saw several open tables. We eventually were given a table that was open the entire time. That was frustrating. ***Service ... Absolutely amazing!!!! Two guys (can't remember their names) took care of all tables efficiently and followed up several times to ensure we didn't need anything. ***Food ... I liked what I ate, mostly. But, for some reason the food is never memorable enough to ever crave. It just tastes ""fine"". We ordered the ""dinner for two"" which came with the following:*Two small soup bowls- We both got hot and sour and it was fine. *One appetizer - We chose Dynamite shrimp. It was fine. Small deep fried shrimp drizzled with a tangy and zesty  sauce. *Two entrees - We got some kinda sweet and spicy chicken which tasted like a slightly elevated orange chicken served with rice. We liked it. We also tried the lo mein. This dish just tasted like egg noodles were tossed with some meat, vegetables, lots of soy sauce and oil. We had asked for ""very spicy"", but it came out ""pretty salty"". Again it was fine, but nothing special that I'd crave again. *Mini fried banana desert - This was the highlight of dinner. Two small banana slices were wrapped in pastry, deep fried, and drizzled with caramel. Two small scoops of pineapple and coconut ice-cream were served on the side with strawberries. Very tasty!!*Appetizer - Tuna Poke - Fearful that the prix fixe menu would leave us hungry, we ordered this appetizer. Meh. Tuna (seemed fresh) was served with some avocado and wonton chips. The chips had that slight stale oil smell which kinda bothered me. I wouldn't order this again. Over all, food is just fine here. Not disappointed, but not excited after the meal either ... except for the desert :)",91101

Grace was our waitress and practically got most of our order wrong or didn't bring it at all. I'm not one to nip pick at restaurants and most of the time i let it slide but this was all bad. I really wanted to tell her  how she can improve but my friend was so embarrassed for her and for choosing to spend his bday dinner there that he asked me not to say anything. mind you the table me to is was fed up by herself they stopped eating. so i ordered a cup of soup with tofu in it he ordered a bowl of soup specifically  saying no seafood and we asked for the chili condiments plus the house hot sauce . i got a huge bowl of soup with a family plate of cooked diced tofu and he got a huge bowl of soup with shrimp  she took our drink order and i never got mine . He asked for a side of crunchy noodles that used to be an add on to any dish we got beef noodles and we never mentioned beef. plus it was a regular dish not a small side. We asked for orange chicken they said they don't make that anymore aardvark she suggested  their version of the dish and she got the order right (shocking) but the quality was terrible .. it was like mongolia noodles frozen shaved meat fried and dried with sauce poured on and it tasted stale . We asked for a cheesecake with a candle on it and emphasized a candle   on it and we got no candle so i asked again as it was our first time asking so Grace brings us a candle that's about to fall in the ice cream that she  soo generously said ""the ice creams on me""  in a tone  like she did us a favor .. the bill was $100 For food we didn't quite order and service we could have skipped and probably would have been better  getting Panda  Express. Grace  either needs more training, stop vaping or smoking if that's a reason you were forgetful , or hang your apron since maybe waitressing isn't for you .  On the plus side they validated parking and that was a treat on its own. I would like a refund but most importantly Grace,it's ok to make mistakes just own up to it  and get better but you had to have known you suck that night and what was worse was  you acted like you didn't forget our requests or messed up our order i mean you brought a large plate of thin sliced tofu for my tiny cup of soup ...like really ?!?",91101

The patio is first come first serve though so make sure you come early. Can't request for a patio seating on your reservation. All in all the food was beyond salty. My party couldn't eat our plates  and boy did we drink loads of water to cool everything. If I had to reorder something from our meal, it would be the filet mignon.

The waitress was very nice and she got the manager. He seemed to understand the issue but when the meal returned it was not much larger than the standard dish. Of course the manager didn't bring it or even look at it. Also they left the rice at the table which turned cold and no one even asked to replace it.

Pretty good, but nothing special.  Very sweet but i got tired of it after awhile.Mapo tofu is not like traditional mapo tofu... This isn't saucy... Its fried and sits on a bed of broccoli... Tofu was good but it definitely was not what we expect.Last we had the Hokkian Street Noodles which in my opinion were disgusting.... Hated every bite... And I only took two.... Took the rest as left overs to see if anyone in my family would eat it because I hate wasting food....I think a solid tip would be to only come during happy hour...

I've walked by this place many times, and never actually try it. But this time the boyfriends family decided to have a family dinner so I get to finally try this place. Parking here is quiet an hassle for myself, since I was very unlucky that took me 20 minutes to find a spot inside the parking lot, that definitely wasn't a great way to start the night especially with an empty stomach. One reason that I gave it a 2 stars is because of their service. We were waiting for almost 2 hours and saw people who came after us gets seated before us. (I meant people who have the same amount of people as us) like we had to go tell them that we've been here for almost 2 hours and all they can do is apologize that they messed up the order. Another reason is their food, everything we order was just too salty for everyone. You have to drink at least a few glasses of water to wash off all the saltiness. We order the garlic lo mein, Korean bbq, sweet and sour chicken, Ma Po tofu and a sea bass. The food took about 30 minutes to come out because they are very pack, but the quality wasn't as good as I thought it would be. Everything was way too salty, the only thing that was actually decent was the garlic lo mein, so I definitely suggest getting that if you ever go there. It was just a little disappointing from the wait to more waiting for the food and the quality comes out alright, and the portion is so small for something that's $18 per plate. Its just not worth it and seeing how much it costs at the end definitely wasn't the best experience. There are many other places that's way cheaper and have better quality. Overall, 3 stars for service, 2 stars for food, 4 stars for environment and decoration and 4 stars for cleanliness. Most likely won't be coming here again. But thank you for the service.",91101

We told our waiter who replaced it with another order of lettuce wraps, per our request.

But then today my son remembered how good it used to be and so we decided to go there. Arrived about Noon (Saturday Jan 4 2020) and we thought the place had gone out of business. There was practically no one there. All we saw was a couple of servers and maybe two tables taken. It was eerie; it hadn't gone out of business, there was hardly anyone there. I prefer restaurants where there are a lot of diners. Even if I have to wait, the food and service at those places, I have found, are best. PF Chang Pasadena must now be a place of lousy service and lousy food. My son and I didn't stay although the hostess tried to lure us in. I felt like I was in a horror movie.",91101
1358,"300 E Colorado Blvd Ste 218 Pasadena, CA 91101",Christina G.,"Arcadia, CA",6/7/2015,3,"If you're not Asian, you'll probably like this place. It's just an Americanized, upscale version of Panda Express and a lot more expensive. If you're an Asian and you love this place, you're not a true Asian lolSo PF changs is located in the second story paseo plaza on Colorado blvd. It's really easy to spot while you're driving by because it's right at the corner. When you enter the underground parking structure, I suggest you turn to the right instead of the left because PF changs is more towards the right and its a shorter walk for you. I came here with my gfs at around 8pm on a Thursday night and man were there a lot of people. I suggest you make reservations ahead of time so you don't have to wait. Our waiter was very nice but I feel like we barely saw him. He didn't really come check up on us, I think he did like once after we got our food and that was it. It was even hard for us to track him down to pay him for the bill as our night ended. The lady that actually gave us our food, I think she's the hostess or something...... Omg!! I don't want to be mean, but Jesus, she's just too much! She's really nice, but dude lady, you gotta tone it down on your voice. She was talking extremely loud, like yelling at us and yelling at her fellow workers. She was so demanding to the other lady handing out our food, she had like a bossy tone of voice, saying do this do that. Like dude, can't you remember and do it yourself? The way she was talking to us too was just rude and too pushy as well; she was like screaming in our ears. We also asked her to check if a salad dressing had any dairy in it, and she never came back to tell us! So my friend was just eating plain salad with no dressing because she was scared it had dairy in it. I had to ask her like 15 mins later when she came back to give us something. Food wise this place is okay.- vegetarian lettuce wraps: (around $10) which is mostly fried tofu. The actual lettuce they give you is kind of small, so it wasn't really proportional to the amount of tofu stuffing that they give you. The taste was yummy though, I didn't enjoy it! - mapo tofu: this is a fried tofu dish with some extremely bland broccoli. I have no idea why on earth this dish is called mapo tofu when it's NOT mapo tofu. Mapo tofu is suppose to be made out of soft tofu with a gravy sauce. What came out was fried tofu with absolutely no sauce lol. Talk about Americanized to the max!!! This was not a legit Asian dish and they couldn't even salt or flavor the broccoli! Get their ring of fire hot sauce, it's pretty spicy and it's better than the other hot sauce they give you.I didn't try anything else my friends got, but they all said it was just okay. Nothing too special. My friend didn't like her salad though. I like how our waiter split up the checks for us so we didn't have to deal with it ourselves. Don't forget to get your parking ticket validated!!!",91101

Salmon is super yummy, cooked to perfection and the sauce with the cooked salad that comes with the dish is super yummy if you like sweet flavors.  I also dipped my lo main on the salmon sauce and it made it even better, again if u like sweet flavors.

Second time around, the food was a lot better. Crab fried rice is decent. Portion is quite skimpy though. Spicy pepper pranws were just okay. Came with a sweet spicy mustard sauce that didn't go well together. The eggplant in garlic sauce was a tad bit on the salty side. Overall, service was good and attentive.

Only 15% of the dishes name on their menu are real Chinese food, the rest, sorry I never know them before. Ordered a few, and all the dishes had a disgusting sweet flavor and the beef were cooked too long and hard to bite. For the pride of being Chinese, I swear the gorgeous Chinese food is way better than this. Their steam rice were dry and not well-cooked. There were too much weird sweet sauce on the BBQ ribs. On my word of honor, this is not Chinese food and doesn't worse the price.

I happened to show up during their happy hour but in order to take advantage of happy hour you can only sit on the patio outside or at the bar area not in the restaurant.I understand this but it was quite chilly even for a summer evening out on the patio and the bar area is small so it fills up quickly. My server was great I wish I would've gotten his name he was very nice to me and showed up right away. I ordered an Asian pear mojito at first which I considered too sweet and when he asked me how it was I told him I thought it was sweet and he volunteered to take it back and give me something else :) I didn't even have to ask him to do that which I greatly appreciated. That's great service right there. I ended up ordering Mongolian beef with broccoli and honey walnut shrimp but the food was averageThe Mongolian beef was very chewy and thick , the shrimp was deep-fried & pretty basic ...the rice was typical .

The 2 hosts were very nice girls very smiley and polite and were able to seat is immediately. Once we arrived to the table, the table appeared to be clean but there was a lot of rice and crumbs left behind in the seat. I usually wouldn't make a big deal but it was a lot more than I could ignore. The host could see that we were disappointed so she offered to wipe it off right away.Once we sat down the server took a lengthy amount of time getting to us and once he seemed to be rushing is by asking if we were ready to order before ever receiving drinks. Almost as if he knew we had been waiting a long time so we probably had plenty of time to look at the menu. Service was definitely slow. The food came out with a different server and we asked them to bring us extra sauce. The sauce did not come so we flagged someone else down and tried to ask for the sauce again. The server finally came to check on us after a while. The food was decent somewhat salty. I was desperate for a refillMy husband and I were finally ready to go and it took forever to get the bill taken care of!

At the end of our meal, we waited about 20 minutes for our check after we were done eating.  At one point, our waiter came by and promised that he would be back ""to clear the dishes.""  Yes, because that's what we're concerned about, is that the dishes get cleared.  Where's our bill so we can get out of here?!",91101

Might of been a coincidence though but then other minorities came in and they were all sitting against the wall also while the caucasians were on the center of the restaurant.

The food was fine, nothing to complain about there. However, my issue is with the staff. My first experience I had asked 1 out of the 4 hostesses there how long the wait was, she said about an hour. No big deal but, the host next to her put my name down and while her coworker was confirming the wait, she told her  ""it an hour and a half wait and that's what she's (referring to me) gonna wait"". Lol okay? While I was eating ALL 4 hostess kept looking at my table starring at me and my boyfriend? Why? I couldn't tell you but, I can tell you that I was extremely uncomfortable and annoyed that they kept looking over and caught them starring multiple times. My second visit was for my birthday. I decided that to be optimistic and give it another try because the food is still good and though let me give them another shot. I came in around 4 o'clock. The restaurant was practically empty. I'm talking 3 tables at the very most. Host still told me it was a 10 minute wait? WTH? Our server wasn't very friendly, he kept talking in a low voice and didn't really seem to care about us. He barely checked on us and was more focused on another two top table across from us and his behavior was significantly more pleasant towards them then to us. I myself work in the restaurant business and I can tell you that this staff really needs to fix their attitude or they need to find a different work environment.

That was NOT fresh in any way. The spinach, mushrooms and the bok choy did not smell or taste like ginger or garlic.

We always come here because that staff is always nice, and seating is prompt. Sometimes we bring our little pooch and sit outside in their lovely patio.However this evening I did not feel very welcomed and was yelled at by the Manager ""Kory or Cory"" ?  Not very nice and very rude. She yelled at me in front of other guests ""I DON'T MAKE THE FIRE CODE!!! Not very hospitable and ruined what was to be a nice evening with my wife and my dog. First off next time you approach a table to speak to a guest, you should always introduce yourself first. For Example: Hi! My name is Kory and I'm the manager. I understand you want to sit outside and you've been waiting a long time? But unfortunately we do not allow the walkway to be blocked because it's a Fire code violation and we have to keep this area clear. I'm really sorry. They would not allow my stroller next to my table outside in the patio. Although there was plenty of room and I was not blocking at all. I simply had to move my pooch in my stroller to the opposite side of my table and that was fine. Just don't be rude about it and ""YELL AT YOUR GUEST IN FRONT OF OTHER GUESTS. I was embarrassed and did not feel welcomed. Ruined my evening.Kevin our server on the other hand was very nice. He did introduce himself and greeted us with a smile and asked how we're doing. Great service and food was excellent. Bartender was awesome too. He made us two rounds of drinks while we waited over an hour for our patio table. Hostess finally came out to let us know. She was nice but not accommodating. That's when the rude lady showed up to our table and said I couldn't park my stroller here. Just be nice to your guests Kory. No need to be rude. Maybe you were having a bad day just don't take it out on other people. Go off somewhere and vent. Then come back treat your guests with respect and hospitality.

We were sat with no dish-ware or napkins and had to ask after our food was served. Food was good and filling so we could not finish it. Asked the same server for to go boxes but they never came. That was it we asked for the manager to let him know of our experience.

I don't mind paying well for a meal, if the food and experience is worth it but P.F. Chang's is flavorless, pedestrian pap. If you are lucky to get the attention of a server (tonight we had to ask 4 different people for help before we could get proper napkins and utensils after our food had arrived), they will be apologetic; but as one of my favorite Key & Peele quotes goes: ""Don't be sorry, be better.""

When we were finally able to track him down to place our order, the food took over 25 minutes to arrive.We asked the busboy for the manager (since our waiter was MIA the entire 25 minutes).

Really a joke for $17.  We also got two of the smaller $7 sides of garlic green beans and long life noodles.  I gave one star each for these becuase they were good and the serving was decent, these servings were bigger than the chicken.  Also when calling on the phone I started to order, halfway through ordering 3 things I was asked to hold, new person then starts over, she then puts me on hold to check if the previous guy started the order, then finally came back and asked me to start over.  Three different people over about 10 mins to place an order.  This place just can't get it together, food is not very good, and really expensive for what it is.  Nice building though, haha.  Do yourself a favor and go to yang chow on east colorado, or even china express on North Lake, much better food.",91101

I like where this location is set on the second level of the Paseo mall. The restaurant has always been clean when I've dined in and their staff are usually nice and attentive. Their food isn't the greatest you'll have but it's good nonetheless. I ordered the Honeydew Walnut Shrimp, Pad Thai, 2 of their sushi rolls, and the calamari. The honeydew walnut shrimp was good, the pad Thai was okay, but their sushi was not only tiny, it didn't have much flavor. Their calamari was a bit too salty and was heavily breaded. They are priced higher than the standard Asian take out but their food is of better quality so you get what you pay for.

I got the spiked iced tea which was really tasty with rum fresh lemon juice and black tea. The hubby got the whiskey sour which was quite generous in the amount of whiskey in the drink.The meh: the spicy tuna roll. Not bad but nothing to write home about either. I think my pavilions grocery store does better.The bad: the one thing we got off the regular menu was the lobster avocado roll. Definitely do not order unless you enjoy bland tasteless food. It defeats the purpose of ordering lobster if you can't even taste it.Lastly, service was disappointing.

So, based on my two experiences here, I have to scratch my head on the overall rating this place received. Hmmmm.... ""$3 - $6 pm HAPPY HOUR""Simply stated, one of the best restaurant HHs available. Here are the real winners, if you ask me:- The sakes are tall and hot ($4)- The calamari is in little strips with rock salt and pepper ($5)- Crab wontons weren't filled with pure cream cheese... they were   actually quite filled with crab. Thumbs up. ($4)- Lettuce wraps are HUGE. Heaping pile of hoisin-flavored chicken,   minced with water-chestnuts, mushrooms, atop a bed of crispy white    noodles. ($5... worth every penny)- Well highballls ($4); and who doesn't LOVE saying HIGHBALLS?!I like the food here. You know why? Because I'm not holding them to some cracked-out, authentic Chinese code... Because I'm not chopping anyone's hands off for veering away from tradition... Because I like Chinese ""fusion"" or whatever you wanna call it. Take it for what it is...

Stellas & Kirin Drafts and egg rolls & spring rolls are $3 We ordered some Kirin and Spring Rolls. Nothing too exciting, but I did have to pile on the chili sauce. Their special concoction of mustard sauce, chili, soy sauce, and etc was much in avoidance. We also ordered the pork dumplings for $4. I liked this appetizer the best. They were generous with their pork and I had a choice of steamed or pan-fried....Fried of course. Duh!! Even though I was popping out of my jeans, I had to try one more appetizer. I wish I hadn't. I picked the Northern Style Spare Ribs. It was the dry rub version. It was tender, but had the taste of Peking Duck. I wasn't too thrilled. I prefer that flavor to only be associated with Peking Duck. Our bartender was really nice and friendly. He gets 5 stars. I had to take a picture of him, because he wanted to be a part of the review.

We asked for the manager in charge.   First, I show her the mustard sauce.  Her logic was that the sauces stain the cups so it is normal.  When I asked ""do you mean to tell me, the bits of chicken come with the sauce,"" the light came on and she responded that it was not normal.  I then showed her the rest of our bounty.  She apologized and comped the green beans along with replacing the dirty items.The two entrees arrive; Sichuan shrimp and an asparagus dish.  Both were drowned in soy sauce.  The cook needs to apologize to the shrimp Gods for their treatment!   Same went with the asparagus, just a thick soy and sugar mix.  Again, truly crappy American Chinese food.   I don't understand how they can charge $15-$30 a plate for this stuff!The final insult was when I asked for a refill, the waitress didn't even bother to return to the table.  What would have been a $6-$8 tip was left at a dollar.   I was pissed I did not have a penny to emphasize the point.  When things go bad fix them and keep a happy customer.  Instead, they lost us forever...",91101

Our waitress was a very sweet girl who never let my water glass get empty which is actually a big thing to me. Normally, when I order water at restaurants, I end up finishing mine and then my bf's because it never gets refilled!! We ordered 2 egg rolls, chicken lettuce wraps, orange peel chicken and the VIP duck. Each were delicious and well made (seasonings, temp, everything). Our duck took longer than our waitress had expected, so she comped us a dessert which I felt was really thoughtful and showed that they cared about our dining experience.

It made it worse knowing Chinatown was only minutes down the freeway.Someone mentioned that a place like this introduces westerns to Asian food. To an extent I guess it's true but if it's this bad and this Americanized, it also gives non-Asians the wrong impression of the Eastern Cultures.

Upon arrival someone in our party reminded the hostess and later on at the table the waiter that we had a birthday person in our party. They seem to have cheapened up on the wait staff training, I seem to remember much more interaction with stuff like the sauce for the lettuce wraps etc, now the stuff is just dropped off.  Original waiter we had was good, asked about drink order, brought some stuff that we had requested such as mustard and chili paste for the lettuce wraps. I must say that the food was very good, oh I know, not authentic, but tasty and well prepared. During our visit the waiter was changed out and things went downhill from there, no more drink orders, food was dropped off and no one came back to see what we needed, I got up and walked to the reception area and pointed at our table and said I needed a waiter. He eventually showed up and I asked for some chili paste and water for the table, he brought that, but then disappeared again. No more drink orders taken, no questions about what we might like for desert, nothing. No mention of any birthday etc, just here's your check, pay up and get out.I then asked for a manager, he showed up and admitted that our waiter had ""Just been promoted to that position"" I have no issue with that, but someone new in a place like PF Chang's should be ""Shadowed"" to make sure they are not making the mistakes this guy was making, don't let them loose on paying customers. I showed the manager my phone with the reservation confirmation on it and asked him what that word ""Birthday"" meant. He apologized and offered to bring over a birthday desert and said that time had come and gone. I explained why I left a 10% tip and told him we were disappointed. He did not seem too concerned until I mentioned the word YELP. He asked what he could to to make it up, by that time I was just venting and pissed off so I was probably a bit over the line, but you go out to have a good time and because they promoted some guy without proper training you have a so-so night.Pros: Food was good as usual.Cons: Birthday overlooked, slacker service involving being left without feedback too long, second drink order never taken, no offer of desert or anything as things wound down.I don't think I will be returning to this location and although we were not ""regulars"" we would go from time to time.",91101

Chang's in general, though I may have been spoiled by my excellent history of experiences at the Sherman Oaks Galleria location. I have eaten at the Pasadena location several times, and have enjoyed the meals, but my last visit there was marred by and ignorant, argumentative, and disingenuous, server. Upon taking our drink orders, when I ordered a whiskey neat and a Tsing Tao beer (that beer is one of things I like about P.F. Changs), the waiter informed my that he was not permitted to bring me two drinks at the same time. I asked how that could be, as I routinely order this at this restaurant and  never had a problem in the past. He then proceeded to explain to me that it was against the law, and mumbled something about the Alcoholic Beverage Control rules. I told him that he was absolutely incorrect and his explanation was complete nonsense, to which he replied that is was a ""company rule"", When I asked when this ""rule"" was created he claimed he didn't know but that he simply was not permitted to bring me what I ordered, I asked him to get the manager at this point, but he persisted in explaining that he had actually gotten in trouble in the past, after a ""mystery shopper"" type report of him serving multiple drinks. I ignored this nonsense and insisted I that I wanted to speak to the manger. He said he could arrange that, and left . After several minutes a manager arrived. She was polite, and immediately told me the server was mistaken, that she would see that my order was filled, and apologized.  As I explained to the manager, being mistaken was not as much the problem as the dogged persistence in arguing with me about the matter and fabricating ""law"", and ""rules"" to cover his mistake. Had he felt uncomfortable about the order he should have consulted his manager.   If not initially, he certainly should have done so when I challenged his position. Standing there arguing with me about something like this was rude and insulting, and is not what I expect to encounter in a good restaurant.Hopefully this was just an aberration for this restaurant, but I will remember this next time I am deciding where to take a friend for dinner.",91101

Since we have not been to PF Chang's in a very long time we decided to go there. We ordered the chicken lettuce wraps. What a disappointment the chicken was on the salty side and the sauce was worse. The lettuce looked old and wilted. We asked if they could replace the lettuce which they did.  We ate the lettuce wraps. I ordered the pepper steak which was so salty that I could not eat.  Told the server that I could not eat it because it was too salty so she asked if I wanted something else. Ordered the Mongolian Beef which was not as salty but unfortunately had to get it to go because by the time the food came out my lunch break was over. My daughter ordered the Walnut Shrimp with Melon which was over sauced but edible.  Service was okay. I don't think I will be returning to PF Chang's any time soon. There are too many good restaurants in the area to be paying for bad food. What I disappointment and waste of our money.,91101

It was my go-to when I lived in the Midwest and couldn't find any decent Asian food. And even though there are tastier Asian options for much cheaper out here, I find myself craving PF Chang's ever so often, especially after I've travelled overseas. We ate at the bar because we did not want to wait 20 to 30 minutes for a table. Service was still very attentive and friendly.  We ordered the chicken lettuce wraps, kung pao chicken, and eggplant. The kung pao chicken and the eggplant was way too salty. But the major bummer was that they got rid of their plum sauce! Which we love with the lettuce wrap. So we tried a sweet and sour-ish sauce instead and it was not the same. Please bring back the plum sauce!!!Packed up leftovers for lunch the next day and it was still way too salty, but still a decent lunch. This took care of my PF Chang craving for awhile. Hopefully next time the food wouldn't be as salty and the plum sauce will be back. Parking is in the attached parking structure. Remember to bring your ticket to get it validated. Depending on how long you park it could be free or at a reduced rate. We paid $1.50 with validation.",91101

To order food . to get our food. And for the check. And what Especially made it so bad was we found a hair in one of our dishes and had them cancel it from our order.

This location is always busy so be prepared to wait. The dishes are good and the prices are okay. They do have a great deal where you can get lunch for two for $40, which isn't bad since you get an appetizer, two main dishes, rice, and dessert. I love the Chocolate Cake! SO GOOD! I would rather come here for dessert and drinks than dinner. If you are out with some pretty picky eaters than P.F. Chang's is a happy medium since it's more Americanized than anything.

While we were waiting, a woman who seemed like a manager showed up out of nowhere without introducing herself or explain what she'd like to chat about, aggressively demanded us to exactly point out what was wrong with the dumplings-- whether it was undercooked or cold, which is ludicrous. When I gave her the look she went on saying how it's not undercooked bc she tried it and they cook it for 10 mins. I just said I don't work there, and I have no idea what's going in the kitchen but the food was cold, and thus we inquired about it. She nodded and walked away angrily.

The girl tending the bar acknowledged us but then ignored us (I think her name was Bianca, or Blanca).  We waited, watched as she served others and took second order for a drink.  Finally I waved my hands rather obviously and she came over.  We each ordered a drink and one appetizer to split.  After about 10 minutes we got our drinks, but no appetizer.  We weren't in a rush so at first it wasn't irritating, but after 20 minutes and no appetizer I started to wave my hands and call out to the bartender.  She made some excuses that it was busy but it really wasn't.  We did finally get our appetizer after another 5 minutes.  BUT HERE IS THE REAL KICKER!!  While we were having the appetizer my friend BEGAN TO CHOKE and cough.  I frantically waved to the bartender and yelled ""she's choking we need water"". . . . the girl came over saw my friend choking and coughing, then walked away to the sink, grabbed a glass, and began washing it, and then washed some others, and then a few more!   I got up and yelled ""She is choking get her a glass of water NOW!!!!""   She looked over casually, picked up one of the glasses and filled it with water and brought it over, no urgency, no apology.  On our way out, we stopped at the hostess desk and express our displeasure and disgust and the hostess just apologized and that was it.  This is by far the worst service I have ever received or experienced in a restaurant, and borders on a lawsuit in my opinion.  Run, don't walk somewhere else.",91101

But I came to the chain for the first time in 9 years, after remembering that I hated it the first time but hoping to give it the benefit of the doubt. But I actually prefer Panda Express to this.A group of six of us from work were in Pasadena on business, and needed to get quick lunch nearby. Somehow the four Chinese people in our group got overruled in the restaurant decision, and we ended up at PF Changs.I deferred to the others in my party do the ordering, and we ended up sharing four dishes off the dinner menu, family-style - kung pao chicken, mongolian beef, mushu pork, shrimp with garlic sauce. We had it with brown rice.I thought that the food is all around kinda awful, but maybe it's just a matter of different palates, because my other coworker thought the kung pao chicken was fantastic. The only one that I thought was palatable was the mongolian beef (granted, I didn't eat the shrimp in the shrimp dish, as a personal preference). The portions weren't very large either, but with the rice, it seemed like just enough to fill us... although we had to stop at Euro Pane afterward for dessert. Heavily overpriced.The positive thing that I can say about this experience is the service - I found it to be friendly, quick and efficient. Our server was aware that we wanted to get out by 1 pm, and so we were in and out of there within 40 minutes.If you're looking for a dine-in chain restaurant, I think you can do a little better at any of the other restaurants at Paseo... I think it's best to skip this one.(I wonder if this is the same way the Mexicans feel when they eat at El Cholo, next door...)",91101

Once we were almost done eating, a woman sat in one of the booths across and had her big dog sit on the cushioned bench.

I was asked to be seated all the way in the back of the restaurant and I could still hear your daughter screaming! Shame on you. Shame on you for not picking up your daughter and walking her out of the patio until she calmed down and for blaming the manager who was simply trying to appease the other 20 people who were seated outside. I heard a couple who walked in after me and wanted to be seated outside but refused to be seated until they saw you get into the elevator and leave. You may have to deal with that kind of screaming and tantrums but other people shouldn't. She wasn't crying, simply screaming and hitting you in the face and you just sat there and laughed. Why should people, who were seated outside enjoying the lovely weather long before you arrived, move inside when you were being the inconsiderate one? P.F Chang's is a family restaurant and as a frequent diner, with a 2 year old myself, I've never had a problem. As a matter of fact, I was just there the weekend prior and an older gentlemen approached our table to acknowledge our well behaved two year old.

My dining companion and I didn't order a lot, only wanting something to fill our bellies after what constituted as a shite day for both of us.Our order:  1 order Crispy Honey Chicken, 1 order Mongolian Beef, steamed rice with both, and a small order of their spicy green beans as mild.For Americanised food, I was pretty satisfied with our small order choices.  My least favourite was the Crispy Honey Chicken - though it was still all right, but the other two were O So GOOD. Those green beans in that sauce were perfect and crisp, and the mongolian beef was just what my mouth wanted.The bill came out pretty average on the expectation level for a chain restaurant like this, and we left in slightly better spirits, our bellies full of chicken, beef, green beans, and rice.",91101

And if you ARE a large party, feel free to laugh and hollar at any given time, because no one will tell you that you're bothering the other diners.And while I was waiting for our waiter, the party next to mine were complaining about how the lady at the counter refused to let her dine by the bar, but let many other groups do so. She blamed it on her race and that it wasn't fair for her to be treated this way. What did the employees do? Tell her it was going to be 2011, and that she should start off the year happy.The entire night dragged on while we waited for our waitress to hand over some takeout boxes and the bill so that we could finally leave.Drive down to San Gabriel or Alhambra for some REAL chinese food that isn't going to cost you an arm.

Spare Ribs - STICKY. Not worth it if you need to go back to the office (side note: tried to wash my hands in restroom - their faucet was broken!!! instead they handed us wet naps) Lo Mein was good... but too flavorful, you know when the noodles just have way too much flavoring going on and the Calamari was my favorite, though I'm sure most people would think it's too salty (I personally love salty). So some other things... waiter Gerard was SO SLOW. I had to walk up to him to ask him where our calamari was, to which he replied... oh, I didn't even have that down!!!

There were a lot more vegetarian items on its menu, so I've only tried a fraction of the offerings. So far, so good.The waiters and maitre d' all worked really hard to keep us happy. When I arrived, they could not find the reservation, but they held a table for us while I waited for my friends to show up.

However, I'm just reviewing the happy hour food and ambience; I've never eaten dinner here.Happy hour is 3:30 p.m. to 6 p.m. every day, not just weekdays. So +1 for that. The chicken wraps and veggie wraps are very good. Spicy with just the right amount of heat, and the lettuce is fresh and crispy. You can also get extra lettuce wraps if you run out. The dumplings are pretty good, but also a bit on the small side. The crispy green beans are addictive and not greasy.I do love the Chinese 88 martini -- Plymouth Dry Gin shaken with fresh lemon juice and topped with sparkling wine -- the quality of the other mixed drinks depends on the quality of the bartender's skills. The Mai Tai can be overly sweet or diluted, so watch out for that.I've always found the service to be capable and friendly. I seem to get a different bartender each time, and recently I got carded. OK, another +1 for that. :-)",91101

The orange chicken was too sweet and runny. I'm gonna keep it short and say the only reason I ate here was because I had a gc. This place is an insult to asian cuisine. Think about it like this, if you're Italian, Hispanic or any other nationality and you eat at an establishment where you know its not authentic, wouldn't you be ""people, REALLLY?! why here?"" mentality.

They do have a happy hour from 3-6pm which I believe has half price appetizers and cheaper drinks.  If you go you absolutely must order the Lettuce  Wraps (appetizer).  We will go to P.F. Chang's just for those alone.  The Crispy Green Beans are also very good and come with a horse-radish type sauce for dipping.  The entrées are more family style than individual, and ordering two is more than plenty for 2-4 people, depending on the people you are with.  (My boyfriend eats more than most Pro-football players, so when he is satisfied, we know that there has been a ton of food.)  Favorite entrées are Chang's Spicy Chicken (although it is nowhere near as spicy as its name suggests) and the Mongolian Beef.  We tried the Lemon Butter Scallops the last time we went and I wasn't crazy about them, but that might have just been personal preference. The service tends to be average.  Not exceptional.  At this particular P.F. Chang's I felt like our service was a bit below average.  While it may have been that we were sitting outside, so were several other tables, all of whom continuously had their water filled while my boyfriend and I sat without water for fifteen minutes. Sometimes I feel that because my boyfriend and I are on the younger side (early 20's) we are given poor service since it's assumed that we won't tip well like most people our age.   I work in a restaurant so I know the stereotypes that all restaurant employees go by, and I know that while a lot of them tend to be more true than you'd like them to be you can't go by those rules every time.  When I tried to pay at the end of our meal, I wanted to pay half in cash and half on my debit (I try to stay away from using my debit card as much as possible.  If I don't have the cash in hand, I don't like to spend it. It helps me to handle my money better).  When I got the bill back, the full sixty dollar amount was charged to my card and the twelve dollars was gone.  The waiter never asked me how I wanted to pay before taking it and he just assumed that I left him a $12.00 tip which I thought was very arrogant.  I'm sorry, but I am not tipping you $12.00 off of my $60.00 meal when our drinks weren't even kept filled.  I will always tip what the waiter or waitress deserves and he did not deserve $12.00.  He's lucky I still gave him the 15%.  Overall, P.F. Chang's is a wonderful experience.  A very good place for a ""nicer"" date out with a comfortable atmosphere.  Food is great and I will continue to go.",91101

I already know that this place is bad for Chinese food because you are basically paying twice as much for inferior quality food. That is not to say that the food is terrible, it's not; it's just that my expectations are much lower for a place like this. What would you expect from a restaurant chain named after Paul Flemming? (Lot's of low fon, that's what...) With that said, the ambiance and service is about on par with the other eateries here at the Paseo like the Yard House or Islands for example. We were here because we were celebrating a birthday and she wanted to come to P.F. Chang's. We walked in without reservations and our party of four was seated within 15 minutes. Our waiter was polite, accommodating, and attentive all evening... I thought their Prix Fixe menu was a good way to sample multiple items with 4 people. The soup was just soup -- you had a choice of egg drop or hot n sour. The appetizers were actually pretty good. I especially liked the lettuce wraps although it's very hard to f*ck up a piece of crispy lettuce. I would have also preferred hoisen sauce instead of the default hot mustard, chili sauce, light soy vinegar that they provided. The crap, I mean crab wonton doesn't taste like crab at all. The choices of entries I left up to the birthday (couple)girl and they chose: Beef with Broccoli, Almond/Cashew Chicken, Crispy Honey Shrimp, and Kung Pao Spicy Shrimp. Since fish was conspicuously absent from the Prix Fixe Menu choices, I decided to augment our dinner with an Asian Grilled Salmon w/asparagus dish. All of these dishes I feel could have been had at a place like Panda Express for the same taste at half the cost... So the only thing else that is offered here and not always at a more authentic Chinese restaurant is the full bar. My friends had a Sakitini and a Mojito, my wife tried an Asian Pear Mojito which I thought was pretty sweet tasting and light on the booze. I seldom order a drink for myself and just had some gingerale... Ok, so now that I've been here I can say that it's ok. I'm not opposed to coming to P.F. Chang's but I would not choose to come for myself. Also for the record, I've been to other P.F. Chang's like the one in Burbank too under similar circumstances...",91101

So that was nice to see that they are trying different things to attract business.On this day I was with a large group. Our server was great and patient with us. We started out at one table and then merged another table with us to create a larger group being served by two different waiters. Our waiter just took it in stride and did his best to serve our immediate group.I ordered the sesame chicken, but was disappointed with all the sauce ladled on top of my brown rice (which I was really looking forward to eating) and therefore didn't eat much of it. :( But there were plenty of steamed vegetables on top. A few of my fellow diners tried the little dessert shooters PF Changs now offers and were disappointed. One said the Tiramisu was dry and another said the Red Velvet had too much frosting.

Second, if you don't mind chains per se, but are just NOT in the mood for one that feels like a chain--big and impersonal with lack of attention to detail--then don't go here.  The huge dining room at PF Chang's is like an upscale cafeteria. We ate on the tiny terrace, which had no atmosphere, but was dark and quiet. Much better. If you're willing to put up with aforementioned chain-like atmosphere in exchange for mongo portions of very tasty pan-Asian cuisine -- then go here!The service was mixed. The hostess seemed -- out of it. Even though there were tables available on the terrace, she told us we'd have to wait. And we did.  Luckily the bartender was chatty, and our waiter was great. He DID explain the sauces on the table for us, and took it upon himself to bring us extra lettuce (which was cold and crisp) for our delicious lettuce wraps. It seems others had worse experiences with service.  Based on my experience and that at others, I believe service at PF Chang's can, at best, be called ""inconsistent"".My favorite thing about the night: A HUGE plate of fresh, nicely cooked shrimp in chile sauce.If I'd just spent the afternoon drinking beer, and didn't need atmosphere but just lots of yummy Chinese-style food (as was the case when I went there the first time), I'd definitely go back to PF Chang's China Bistro.",91101

I had a very positive experience at the PF Chang's in Boston recently, so I assumed that my family and I would have a similar experience on a late Saturday night in Pasadena.  I was very, very WRONG!!  I could tell that several kitchen and wait staff were getting ready to pack it in for the night because it was about 1+ hours to closing time.  When I approached the front desk one of the staff was talking on what I assumed was the reservations hotline when his coworker walked up and handed him another phone for him to also talk on.  Neither of them acknowledged me and that they would help me.  About 5 minutes later, another guy walked up and said he'd would have someone help us soon.  About 30 minutes later, I finally saw the hostess at the front entrance.  There were a couple of other parties that arrived after we did and were seated, had their drink and food orders taken, while my family were sitting at our table waiting for our server/waiter to take our order.  My hubby and I were very tempted to leave the restaurant and go to Paseo Cantina instead.  I talked to the hostess and explained that we were waiting for about 20 minutes and our waiter hadn't yet taken our order.  Our waiter showed up about 10 minutes later.  My hubby and I ordered the spciy eggplant which I thought was very good - the seasonings, sauce consistency and tenderness of the eggplant were right on.  I also ordered the salt and pepper prawns which were a bit on the oily side and tasted more salty than peppery.My kids and I shared a pot of Dragon Oolong(sp?) tea.  We wanted to add sugar too it, but I said no let's drink it the way it came served --  server also provided lemon slices.To the restaurant's credit they did offer us a complimentary plate of what was probably BBQ spare ribs since the kitchen made a mistake in preparing this order for another patron.  So my oldest took the spare ribs and liked them and took the rest home as leftovers. My oldest ordered the honey glazed shrimp which looked like the same coating that is used for orange chicken.  She didn't care for it much and preferred my salt & pepper prawn shrimp and kept eating my food ;( My youngest ordered the grilled salmon which came with string beans and egg fried rice.  My youngest likes salt so she loaded  her rice with soy sauce.  The salmon looked moist and my youngest did like it.  My hubby thought his eggplant was good and he mixed it with some chilis and hot honey mustard sauce.  The honey mustard sauce must''ve had some wasabi in it, so I passed it on to him.  Later in the evening, my hubby's tummy started aching  --- could it have been the chili sauce or hot honey mustard causing the flare up -- since I was OK after eating the eggplant without additional sauces??  It was late in the evening so our server didn't offer us dessert our coffee after our meal.  My hubby and I were quite unhappy with the delay in order and food service.  I'm willing to give this place another try but hesitant if the lunch or dinner service is on the same level earlier in the day.",91101

Chang's in some way might dissolve those misperceptions.

I feel bad for the nonasian people that want to review this restaurant but are afraid to because of all the Asians that bash it.  

Oh yeah.  Sorry to disappoint you ""Orange Chicken"" fans out there but they don't have it.  Although they do not serve it, they do have something similar known as ""Crispy Honey Chicken"".  I think it's tastes comparable.  It came as a shock to me when I actually recently went to a more authentic Chinese restaurant in MPK that also served the dish.  It didn't taste that bad.",91101

I went with a friend who is a pain to go out with because of her allergy to gluten. Luckily they have a great gluten free menu and many accommodations for any allergies.

So, here I was with this big group outside and 10-15 later I get no page. It's 8pm now, which is when my reservation was set for so I went up to the front desk and the manager Alfredo comes up to me and explained that they are waiting for a group that had been finished eating and that they are just waiting for them to leave to set out table. He said the group had been there for an hour and a half and it should be amy minute now. So, another 15 go buy and the manager Alfredo comes up to me again and apologizes, then tells me he will comp some appetizers in the house since we've been waiting so long and that they were setting up for another location and would have us sat in a few minutes. So, we finally get to our seats and our appetizers get there within minutes. They literally came before iur waitress could take our order of drinks. So kudos to the manager for handling that situation well. Our waitress Bailey, was an amazing server and on top of everything and everyone in my group. Once we finished eating, Thai brought out my wife's cake and also included and extra ice cream desert all compliments to the manager Alfredo.

I believe that the reason was the person was working and couldn't hear the phone ring (my family was calling and texting a lot!). Also nothing happened to any of my accounts on my phone. It wasn't until I got home almost an hour later that I noticed it was gone. My bank account, my emil, amazon, ebay, netflix, and facebook were all intact. I think they were still working.  ALSO my group was in the very back. NO ONE had a reason to go there unless they worked there to clean up. MY phone is black so no one would really notice it unless they were there.After 3 hours then it was finally turned off.  That's when they did get off work I think.

(a band was playing and we wanted to listen while we ate). we waited and waited... there were about 6 empty tables. :)  music was good so we werent too angry... 10 min later i couldnt take it. went to the hostess and she was like ""oh we're ready for you"". our buzzer didnt go off jerk...sat down and got the  meal for two for 39.99? or was it 49.99 i dont remember. you get to chose your soup, an appetizer, two entrees, and two desserts. we got the egg drop soup. pretty good for something that didnt taste chinesey. kind of tasted like egg soup i got in japan. appetizer dumplings were ok. just dumplings... sauce was weak.we got the kung pow chicken, mongolian beef? and we ordered a side of spinach. (u need ur veggies!!)worst kung pow i've ever had. actually.. the worst chicken dish i've ever had. it was dry... like... have you ever had dried tofu? but harder... sauce wasnt spicy. it has a flame on the menu and i was worried since i cant take spicy... but even i couldnt even taste it. the only good thing about this dish was the peanuts.mongolian beef was ok. very salty... worst dish of the night? the garlic spinach. how do  you mess up spinach? well... you make it taste bitter... as if you burnt it bitter, and some how have it look undercooked. it looked like i put the spinach in cold oil and cooked it in a pan for 3 seconds. how did it taste so bitter when it wasnt even cooked? where was the garlic??? sooo disapointing.  the dessert was ok. very tiny and cute but thats about it.if it wasnt for the gift certificate i had, i would have been mad. the server was nice and i gave him a good tip but the food was just gross. even if i had a gc i would not come back to this place again. the thought of the day was:""i want to go to every table and ask, 'DO YOU REALLY THINK THIS STUFF TASTES GOOD???.""'",91101

Food came out eventually, and as ordered. No complaints about the food itself.When it came time to pay the bill, our server took my gift card. We witnessed him swiping it through the credit card machine. And then he did it again, and again. Next thing we know, the manager is there, accusing me of trying to pay an $88 dollar tab with a card that had only $12 on it (okay, I rounded the figures, but you get the gist). I told her that the card was worth $100, and it was obvious that the swipe had gone through the first time our server ran it. After he ran it, it was locked, and they had no way of checking for that night. My friend paid for the bill, I was mortified (I get paid once a month, no cash on hand at that time). So much for treating my friends! I felt like such a jerk!Manager gave me her card, and it was finally cleared up a few days later. In the meantime, I spoke to another manager, who promised me some PF Chang dollars. She was very nice.However, when I went to get my refund, the original manager was there.

They looked liked chicharrones but unfortunately they didn't taste as good . The waiter took a while to check on us. When we complained about the scallops , all he could say was that's how they make them. I said HARD and DRY . We asked for something else . When he brought that out , he said yea they were dry and hard not cooked right . No manager came to talk to us , no discount was given . Nothing. WE did not realize we had been there  almost 2 hrs.

The hot and sour soup was OK, thick soup and with pretty decent flavor.  The ""chicken with lettuce wrap"" was just a plain old diced chicken with oyster sauce, can't hardly find the chicken - nothing fancy. For entree, I had the Orange Peel Shrimp and Beef Schezwan.  The Shrimp was covered with heavy sauce (can't figure the taste) with no flavor of orange, nor could I recognize the taste of shrimp. It could have just been a piece of sponge or cardboard.  It was just a horrible dish that tasted like 2 days old.  As for the Beef dish, the sauce was OK, but the strips of beef were so dried and over cooked that it was like a ""leather"" that was sliced into pieces, then tossed in the vegetables.  The dessert in the shot glasses were the highlight of the night.  Light and moist chocolate cake and tiramisu. Over all, the dishes were 2 points for me on the scale of 1 being worst and 10 being extraordinary.  Go to Panda Inn Express, they have far better food than this over-rated restaurant. How many Asians do you see there going crazy about the food they ordered?",91101

In fact, I thought I did like it when I first dined at one about a decade ago. However, the next two times I dined at one (Pasadena), I started realizing I didn't like it so much but probably would still have given it 4 stars. This is my 4th time at one (3rd at this one) and I would have given it 2 stars for the food alone. My favorite last time was the chicken lettuce wraps and I realized this time that they are not so great. About ~3 stars though since it's not bad. The ahi tuna appetizer is so not good though. 2 stars for that one. This ahi tuna is not done the usual way. Comes with a nice salad but not right unless you don't like sashimi. Inside tasted like tuna. Outside tasted strangely of some type of cooked mystery meat with a charred smoky taste. Didn't like the sauce on top. It is perfect to get a seafood hater to eat some tuna. It even looked like raw beef seared on the outside. Maybe you could trick a fish hater with it. It is also perfect for a midwesterner's taste bud perhaps (from my preconception but what would I know). I've heard other people say before, ""P.F. Chang's is white people's Chinese food."" Now I have to break down and admit, yep, totally. Saving grace is the banana spring rolls. On the sweet side in case that's not your thing. Banana in an egg roll exterior with coconut-pineapple ice cream and fresh berries on top. Mmm, mmm. Perfect size for splitting. 3 stars. Also, really good iced jasmine blackberry green tea (add a squeeze of the lemon wedges that come with it instead of sugar).  I am so very glad I was honest with the waiter when he asked and I told him the ahi tuna wasn't so good. He took it off the final bill (so I tipped him well). =D Would not have gone here tonight if my friend hadn't wanted to go. Will not be back either unless it is for the same reason or for dessert & iced tea. Too bad there's no bread so I can fill up on that and then order dessert if I have to dine here again. The service was not so great and there wasn't even a lot of diners. Taking the ahi tuna off more than makes up for it though. (EDIT: Actually, I'm going straight for the chicken lettuce wraps if I eat here again but will ask for less salt and sauce.)",91101

My experience at this PF Chang's in particular has only been fabulous customer service. One time my husband and I were eating there for our anniversary and the hostess screwed up our reservation situation and we had to wait extra time, and to rectify everything, the manager gave us a free dinner! Then tonight we ate there and I accidentally lost my parking ticket and the hostess told me that I show them a receipt I might not have to pay the parking fee. I told this to the manager when he was printing out our receipt, and he gave us the $9 that it costs to cover the parking lot fee.

We opted for the dinner portion and what we got was exactly 8 pieces of chicken. 8!!!! I was shocked. The mongolian beef was half the portion size of what we previously have gotten and what even these pictures reflect. Sadly, the mongolian beef was dry and overcooked to the point of being crispy. Not the delicious steak were were looking forward to. We asked the waitress, and she stated all the portion sizes are now that size and that PF Changs has changed how they do things.  They changed, but not for the better, and the prices certainly do not reflect the sad, sad portion sizes we got.  We spent over 100.00 and left still hungry--Days later, I cannot get it out of my mind and I normally don't write reviews, but I just couldn't help but wonder, PF Changs, what happened?  If we are going to spend that kind of money, next time we'll just go to Cheesecake Factory and call it a day. It was nice when you were a great company who cared about providing a balance between quality and quantity. Now, it's just sad.

I order the Lo Mein with chicken and the Chang's Spicy Chicken- both were mediocre. If they were $5-6 per entree, fine..I wouldn't complain; but at $18/entree umm no. Back to the service- at 5-10 mins after the promised time of my order being ready and brought to my car, I decided to just go in and see how much longer it would be. Server after server walked right past me without even acknowledging me while I stood there waiting for someone to help me.

They obviously don't have any customer service and won't resolve issues if you have problems with your take out. Why should I as a customer call back and even when I did no resolutions. Obviously spend your money else where or different location. Angela should be thankful to be having a job during a pandemic and not treat your customer with disrespect.",92503

I think they were using a skeleton crew. The food was great but we had to ask for the sauces and sugar for the iced tea. They let the dishes pile up at the table and when we were done they cleared everything. We had the lettuce wraps, egg drop soup, Chang's spicy chicken, Mongolian beef, signature lo main, beef and broccoli, crispy honey chicken. The dishes were great! The prices were a little high but I guess they need to make up the difference. 142. Includes tax and tip! That's 28.50 a person. Yes we would go back! Sorry I didn't have my phone so no pics.",92503

Let me start by telling you that they have changed their menu and their prices are a little high but the portion sizes are bigger too. I have not been here for lunch but for dinner it has become really popular. They do delivery, curbside as well as they are affiliated with DoorDash, and other delivery services.Make sure you order their secret menu sauce called ""Ring of fire"". We ordered their Thai Red Harvest Curry (Vegetarian) also we ordered Changs Spicy Chicken (but wr got it with tofu) and also their Avocado Egg Rolls. All of this was amazing. Also if P.F.

Do not order Togo--- HORRIBLE--(started ordering in March because Covid) my girls are obsessed with lettuce wraps and honey chicken.

Chang's until today. We got take out and ordered the Ma Po Tofu dish. I have ordered this dish at several different P.F. Chang's locations and asked to change to a sweeter sauce like the sauce from the orange chicken and it's never an issue. the process of ordering over the phone took around 20 minutes for just one entree here. The guy I was talking to on the phone put me on hold multiple times. First time when I asked for the ma pa tofu(did he not know that existed?), again when I asked if it came with broccoli and again when I asked if I could change the sauce to something less spicy. Like seriously?? you need to know your menu if you work in a restaurant. It's part of training. When I received the food the tofu was soaking wet and had a pool of water under it. It seemed like something that was frozen and microwaved and then served to me. When I went inside to ask for a refund the manager was kind of rude and blamed the watery texture on the sauce that I changed. No sauce tastes like water or creates a soup at the bottom of my plate, ever! And I order this dish frequently at different locations. My advice is that management needs to learn how to take accountability and the staff need to learn their menu and substitutions better. They're all talking to each other and texting in there since it's slow due to covid-19 so maybe take the opportunity to learn something. The manager did give me a refund so for that I give 2 stars and not just 1",92503

So are you going to let me place a takeout order?"" Her reply, ""Well yea, I mean, what are you ordering tonight?"" I proceed to place my order, I remind her my husband can leave in the next 5 mins to drive 2 miles to their restaurant for pickup. She says the order willBe ready in 20 mins which let me just remind you, is STILL all happening before they close at 9pm. So I say all of this to remind you who is reading this review, that if it's inconvenient to their staff to ""help you"" then they will. But based on the back to back hang ups followed by the reminder that was given to me, my bet is this happens regularly and their manager may not even know.

The broccoli and beef tastedliked gum after chewing it for 6 hours. The lettuce wrapped chicken had these noodle things that were so stale I felt like I was biting into a Birkenstock. The fries tasted like they grabbed the leftover steak fries from Red Robin's garbage and used that to make them. The green beans were good. Good flavor but when the best part of a meal was green beans, that's a sad day. The rice was made yesterday in the microwave. We spent over 200 dollars for a stomach ache for the entire team.

The last visit not only had terrible food but the order was wrong as well. Didn't say a word so i decided to call to ask for the store manager and i get this clown Alfredo who says he is confused by what i want when i request the ""Store manager"". He said he was the store manager and i recall it being woman so i asked again and he says he is one of the managers. No moron i asked for the ""store manager"". I wanted to order for my wifes birthday and wanted the store manager to know we didnt say a word last time but wanted to avoid another bad meal especially on her birthday with curbside pickup only. By Alfredo telling me he is confused by what i want when i request to speak to the ""Store Manager"" i proceeded to tell him he is beginning to offend me. (with his stupidity). He says he is very busy and doesn't have time for someone who is offended. This guy has to be great for business. Last time i set foot in this place for sure.It's just to inconsistent.

Mean while they are taking MORE ORDERS?!!I've asked for a manager several times....Update; 05/12/20Angela , the manager for PF Chang's spoke with me todayFirst thing things first, my heart goes out to ALL essential workers! Second, this restaurant and its employees received over 900 orders and CORPORATE apparently did not shut the online order system down ( so they just kept coming in!!)nor were they allowed to bring in the proper amount of employees needed to keep up with this enormous work load. That being said, it still does NOT give ANYONE the right to verbally attack nor abuse another person's.  As witness's (Thank goodness others had ALSO called PRIOR to myself And my witness of WHICH name and number I was given HAD ALREADY CALLED!!!)  collaborated my VERSION of the events and how it unfolded.  As I explained to her about the Yelp review, it wasn't about the WAIT it was about the TREATMENT for THE WAIT.  And the wait trying to find an ANSWER..... and the TREATMENT for THAT!    MOST of their employees are AMAZING!! . But, as I told Angela, after the verbal attack both in person and online, being told I'm not wanted as a patron and the name calling by her employees I do not wish to come back. ( she offered to refund my entire bill which I stated was not fair to everyone who had worked hard that day) Yes, kindness ABSOLUTELY does matter, but it goes BOTH ways! When you treat YOUR customers like CRAP in a stressful situation, it RUBS THEM the wrong way! After all, THEY are SPENDING THE MONEY to have a free day and you are MAKING it.

1967,"3475 Tyler St Riverside, CA 92503",Annie T.,"Riverside, CA",9/12/2017,4,"Food: 4 stars. Bogo entree offer sweetens the deal (otherwise it could be very pricey). Orange peel shrimp so good. Garlic green beans little undercooked but good flavor. Mongolian beef was bit plain to me but hubby liked it. I needed hot sauce (which was bit spicy and not watered down). Kids' noodle was not bad (little chewy with some pieces of chicken). The Kids' crispy chicken was fine but the tiny cup of fruit was definitely not worth it, better to get the side of snap peas (which was rather plain tasting but better than 4 cut pieces of sour strawberries and a ball of honeydew). White rice and brown rice were pretty hard but this wasn't a heavy meal unlike burgers and fries so I was satisfied. * Happy Hour I believe was 3-6 pm. Cost: 3 stars. Can add up so we definitely come only when we have a free app or other offer. Service: 4-5 stars. We come once every 2-3 mths. This young man from the kitchen who brought out the food was very nice and attentive. Our waiter was pretty good too: friendly but we had to wait a bit or flag him down sometimes.",92503

Well to start, just like my review for another location, i don't come here for authentic Chinese/Asian cuisine. I come here for P.F. Chang's. Some people may ask why that is and I can say that the dishes they make are fresh, consistent and pretty darn good. They also don't taste like they are dripping with msg. This location is in the same parking lot as the Tyler Galleria and traffic on the weekends or any busy day sucks. If you have to deal with traffic all week like I do it is not fun getting in and out. Once you get in, parking is pretty cool. We did come at 230 so it was off hours. Service was tops and everyone was super nice and we were well taken care of. I always join rewards options for restaurants so I had a buy one entree get one free. We ordered Mongolian beef, Kung pao shrimp and cup of hot and sour soup. All was tasty and good. The areas I noticed PFs has changed for the worse are the following:1. They no longer bring a cool box of chopsticks for each member of your party to select. They now have the disposable chopsticks sticking out of a glass in the middle of the table. 2. They no longer come to your table and mix different sauces for me to try on my yummy food. I now have to ask them to bring me sriracha, chili paste and whatever else I need, yawn..They no longer have the prixe fixe menu. Now it's all a free for all. Other than that, it's the same old P.F.

It is obviously a holiday and you would think as a restaurant, they would have everything organized and prioritized for family's. My family placed an order on Thursday, three days ago, to be ready today at 4:30 for Mother's Day. We arrived here 10 minutes before the time we chose and called as directed. The woman who answered told us our order probably wouldn't be ready until 5:30 and offered to check if our order was even being made. We waited about 20 minutes and a man answered. I would like to note this man was very rude and obnoxious for no reason at all. He talked over my father while he was asking when our order would be in the process of being prepared and this man answered ""In a perfect world I wish our orders would be on time but this is not a perfect world so you can go ahead and leave and cancel your order or file a complaint because we're behind and I can't make your order right now"" YELLING to my father and my father politely said ""listen man you don't have to talk over me, that's not necessary and I would like to speak to a manager"" so this man responded ""you are speaking to one"" and my father asked to speak to another one then the man proceeded to hang up. Of course since coronavirus affected businesses and they are just now started to reopen there will be setbacks adjusting. However, if you cannot accommodate orders and times YOUR RESTAURANT offered customers to place, you should not be running right now. It is a holiday that people would like to celebrate with a nice meal and for you to not have orders ready for hours is ridiculous. And to whoever this rude manager was I hope nobody experiences something like this either with them as we did. This manager should not be a manager if he cannot properly respond to customers who just want the food they paid for. This is by far the WORST experience we have had here and I hope they fix these errors. Don't waste your time!",92503

Customization used to be very nice- when you ordered appetizers or something requiring a sauce, the waiter would mix it for you to your desired heat/flavor, etc.  Now you get two little cups with no explanation of what they are.  Entrees have also become increasingly pricey.  Portions are small - making them really only shareable for a person or two. Overall - it's just turned into an over priced - small portioned - ok food quality place.  The taste is now very institutional - not a good thing when a party of 3 has some basic and simple food choices with zero alcohol and walks out with a $70 bill.",92503

Janugie and her patronage of PFC.I've been so patient with this location and have given them so many chances.  Today was it for me!  They do get 2 stars for the food. The food is always great,  but when it comes to service, forget it!  Take-out orders take forever, they don't pack the items you request from the website (online ordering), no curbside at this location (it used to be an option on the website and you could select it but they actually didn't have it because they said they said they were too short-staffed but they didn't inform you of this until after orders were placed & you've been sitting there in curbside parking waiting for you food),  the to-go order area is always ""closed"" forcing you to go to the bar and wait even longer,  and this is after some improvement. Ahhh sorry for venting but I needed to put it out in the universe even if I'm the only one who reads this.  LolPlaced an online order today a little before 11:30am to be ready at 12:00pm. Mind you, I'm purchasing lunch with a corporate issued giftcard that was sent to me because of all the service issues we've previously had. We were giving them the opportunity to earn back our loyalty!  I get there right at 12:00pm, to-go area is closed again so I head to the bar and I wait to be acknowledged for more than 5 minutes (bartender looks my way then walks away to the register).  I know I'm short but you can't miss me, c'mon! lol  Finally, I lock eyes and the bartender starts working like crazy at the register.  So I'm still waiting...  Finally he comes over, tell him I have an Internet order and he reads my name from the paper in his hand. Yup - that's me!  Apparently, that frantic work at the register was him working on my order.  He's entering it and the receipt order is stamped 12:06pm!!! But my order was promised at 12:00pm!!!I scheduled it at that time for a reason - work obligations - that was the point of ordering online & selecting THAT time. I had something scheduled at 12:30pm and this was my only time to pick up something and eat. So he drops off the receipt and says my order will be up SOON!  UMMMM it was supposed to be ready @ 12p but ok.... waiting.... still waiting.... Then he had to get a manager to approve the giftcard payment.  Waiting some more....  I don't walk out of there until 12:18!!!!!! 12:18 people!!!!! Online order placed before 11:30am for pick-up @ 12:00pm wasn't ready until 12:18pm!!! WTH??  Mind you, I was giving them a chance so I bit my lip... Didn't say anything the entire time.  Just thank-you's and smiles....From them...No apologies... No thank-you's... But I will say, everything I ordered was there and he packed all condiments, plates, etc. And like I said, food was good. But the service here has been declining over the years and we agreed we're just done.  I think there's like $5 left on the card if anyone wants it!  :P",92503

I find the lack of service from our male waiter inexcusable to ignore kids that had already ordered and hungry and not once check on them especially on a very slow evening.

The other rude host came over quickly and said ""oh yeah put them on the left side of thE restaurant"". I'll be honest with you ithink really bothered me considering there were a large amount of people who walkEd in after us and was already seated.  I feel this was discrimination against my partner and I considered we are Lesbian.

And, the curry sauce (the main point of the meal and pretty much makes the dish) was so gross. It's tart and sour like there's a wrong ingredient in it. It was yellow, yes. But it tasted quite strange. Waiters should recognize an issue with the dish and handle it before it gets to the customer. If a dish is burnt, dry, cold when it shouldn't be... don't even bring it out. Note to self. Go to Changs for the cocktails only.Also, did I mention the curry sauce was all wrong.

Too many other options to screw over your customers. Won't be back",92503

The atmosphere was good, everything I had was really good and the service was excellent. If you like hot and sour soup this one is really good! I'm going back soon just for that. The szechuan beef was delicious, just the right amount of spice. The only thing I would say is that the lettuce wraps are overrated. They were good but nothing spectacular.",92503
2064,"3475 Tyler St Riverside, CA 92503",Vin S.,"Orange, CA",12/27/2017,5,"Came here for an after work date night. The place wasn't crowded at all for a Wednesday evening, but all the seating at the booths were taken and the friendly manager told me that reservations are recommended for booth seating. We had the shrimp tempura sushi with the pad Thai and some dim sum appetizers. The service was prompt and food was pretty tasty. Will return again",92503
2065,"3475 Tyler St Riverside, CA 92503",Belinda O.,"Moreno Valley, CA",1/21/2019,5,Came for date night. Jesse was our server. He took our drinks and appetizer order. Our drinks and appetizers came out in less than 10 mins which was great considering we were there on a Friday night. Our meal then came out within another 10 mins. Jesse was very tentative to us. He always made sure our drinks were filled and continued to check in on us throughout our meal. Jesse really raised bar for 2019 with his excellent customer service! Keep up the great work!,92503

Smaller than other restaurants, but it was nice place to eat after we shopped in the mall.- Drinks are delicious! The strawberry cucumber limeade  and their ginger drink is amazing!- Tofu lettuce wraps are always great!- The Eggplant dish has a lot of flavor and I definitely recommend it.- The Vegetable Lo Mein needed more flavor. It didn't have too much flavor like the rest of the dishes we received.- Vegetable Spring rolls were pretty good. Overall a great place for vegetarians, they have more options than when I last visited this place. (2 yrs ago)",92503

She thought we should be seated last and the last to arrive to be seated first! My husband pointed it out to the host and she was adamant they weren't!  This girl need to pay attention especially since this is probably one of the easiest jobs I can think of!      Our server was friendly and attentive as usual.  We ordered chicken lettuce wraps, Chang's Spicy Chicken, Orange Peel Chicken, and Shrimp Lo Mein.  The food was not hot, it was warm and am inclined to say it wasn't fresh.  The chicken was soggy and the sauces used to coat the chicken looked too thick, the consistency you get when you reheat leftovers.  It was a disappointment especially when your paying over $15 a plate, the portions have gotten even smaller.      I won't be coming back!",92503

2070,"3475 Tyler St Riverside, CA 92503",Annette H.,"Montclair, CA",11/26/2017,5,"I haven't been to a P.F. Chang's in years. I was not particularly impressed when I went so it has never been on my short list of places to go. When my niece was diagnosed with Celiac disease when we noticed that they were recommended by most gluten-free watchdog sites. Consequently, the chain then became one of the restaurants we could go to as a family. The last time we tried to go to one, there was a 2 hour wait. We decided - just no. All of this brings us to yesterday. We were in the area, and this is where my niece chose to go. I cannot tell you what excellent service we got!  We are the MOST high maintenance group of eaters in one group (the Celiac was not with us this time, but we are still a bit on the ridiculous side). Collectively, we have the following allergies bell pepper, pineapple, & egg. We have one that won't eat meat, one that can't have too much bread/sugar, and one that will only eat orange chicken. The allergies can be bad or not depending on the individual, i.e. my sister will have a bad reaction to egg if it is served scrambled into the dish but she usually won't if it is the ingredient of the batter in a fried dish.  In additional we usually drink about a gallon and a half of iced tea throughout the meal if it is good.  Our waitress was EXTREMELY conscientious about everything. She even brought the manager over to discuss our options. She kept our drinks constantly filled (the unsweetened mango iced tea was DELICIOUS!). In all of the confusion,  one of the dishes was served with red bell peppers. We brought it to her attention,  and immediately she took it away. One of the party who does not have the bell pepper allergy made a comment like ""hey"" and we said it had bell peppers so she was going to replace it. Since it didn't affect him, she offered it to him. Which he gladly accepted.  When he ordered a yuzu lemonade - she brought out the bottle so that we could review the ingredient list so that we could make sure it was safe. Throughout the meal they checked on us to make sure everything was up to par. (Everything was great!  Shrimp pan-fried dumplings were my favorite).  My great-nephew is super picky and won't eat hardly anything. He loved the children's orange chicken so much he asked for a second helping of chicken. The restaurant brought out just the chicken with out the rice and broccoli. (He finished both helpings of chicken and most of the broccoli!) We had quite a bit of leftovers. Again the waitress was very conscientious about packaging them up for us. She kept the two same dishes apart and clearly labeled the one with bell peppers. The food was very good but what truly made the meal was the service.   We know that we are high maintenance and a pain, so we try to be as pleasant as possible. It is rare when we find a restaurant so accommodating, helpful, and truly, truly friendly. They went out of their way not only to ensure that we had a good meal but also that we had a great experience.",92503

We went for dinner around 5:30pm and the place was pretty much empty( Cheesecake Factory across the parking lot had people waiting outside.... That should have been my first clue.

Specifically Katie was rude and seemed annoyed for no reason when we should of been upset.

I wasn't paying so I didn't call for a recount. It's really nice inside but the food isn't very good and the portions are quite small for the price. We ordered 3 different chicken dishes and the meat was very dry and tasted old. I've never had a good experience at a PF Changs but I always seem to end up there. It's just the way the dry chicken bounces.,92503

Given that I am of chinese descent, I was very skeptical about my friend taking me to PF Changs for dinner. But this place is WOW. I would rather place this in Asian Fusion than authentic chinese though. Their lettuce wrap's super good. They're even better than the ones I've had at cheesecake factory. We ordered the meal for two which came with two choices of soup, an app, two entrees, and a dessert. The hot & sour soup was a bit too much for me, our family home recipe is much better. But I still kept an open mind. The vegetable lo mein and mongolian beef we ordered were absolutely superb! This is wayyyy better than panda express (thats a no brainer)I would come back for the atmosphere and service. I really liked how clean the restaurant was. (try any local 626 chinese joint, and you'll know how greasy the tables are, & service is equivalent to pretty much non existent.)The meal was more than enough for the two of us priced at $39.95 for both plus we had enough for lunch the next day!",92503

Ordered hot tea and curt brought us  Dragon Oolong tea.   Excellent taste.   We ordered a side salad which is cold and yummy blend of delicious greens with a homemade vinaigrette.   Entire bill was $30. 00.  A no brainer.   Nice job PF Changs and Curt the comedian.,92503

I pointed out that the coupon specifically says what the coupon is NOT VALID with and it only mentioned the ""Lunch pairings"" and I was here to order a wok classic.

I ordered Mongolian Beef bowl, and the wife ordered Vietnamese Noodle Salad with shrimp ($14.95) both are on the lunch menu. Sabrina brought the food, and we began to eat. My wife noticed that the noodles in her salad seemed either ""under cooked"" or raw. As she continues to eat it, we notice the noodles are still in the original shape. Sabrina checked to see how we were doing and my wife told her about the noodles. She went to the kitchen to check about the preparation of them, and then a gentlemen came to the table. I assumed he was a a manger, he showed little to no concern about the noodles, saying that they are cooked and placed in a cold water bath to stop the cooking. He offered to have it remade and she said no, with the fear of them doing something inappropriate because she had complained. He also went back to the kitchen to verify about them, and never came back to our table. When the server brought the bill, I was surprised there was no adjustment for the salad. I didn't expect it to be comped but some kind of acknowledgement would've been nice. As I left, I asked the hostess who the man was that came to our table as the manager, and she replied ""his name is Freddy"". Freddy did not impress me as the acting manager. P.F.

2104,"3475 Tyler St Riverside, CA 92503",C M.,"Riverside, CA",7/10/2016,4,"12/4/17 UPDATE: I still enjoy PF Changs with regularity but not as much or as frequently as before. The food quality and quantity have declined a bit while prices have increased and customer loyalty programs tightened. I hope they take note and improve--I would hate to lose one of my favorite go-to veggie spots.PF Chang's China Bistro (PFCB) provides a fresh, consistent and tasty ""asian fusion?"" experience in a clean, pleasant and inviting environment.  I've been a fan of PF Changs forever...used to drive to Orange County locations (Fashion Island, Mission Viejo, Irvine Spectrum) and LA (Santa Monica) at least 3x/mo until Riverside opened. AMBIANCE:  The decor is attractive and timeless.  The facility is consistently clean and well-attended all the way to the restrooms. Tables are ready with nice chopsticks, cloth napkins and solid utensils. Beverages are served in glass, not plastic (pet peeve.) Real candles add glow to tables for evening dining.  Menus are clear and well presented.  My only objection is the selection of background music which appears to have no thematic rhyme or reason...a bit loud (as are the acoustics in general) and does not quite fit!FOOD: PFCB has standard menu items and tries to keep it fresh by offering a seasonal menu rotated quarterly.  The food good quality.  I feel healthy when I eat there but am aware that sodium content may be a bit high.My absolute favorite thing at PFCB is the vegetarian lettuce wraps.  Many of my non-vegetarian friends actually prefer the vegetarian lettuce wraps over the non-vegetarian ones--that is after I actually convince them that the ARE vegetarian!  The veggie lettuce wraps use a five-spice tofu, cut into very small cubes, which provide a very similar texture and taste to chicken.Other favorite vegetarian dishes include Coconut Curry Vegetables (I order it with five spice tofu instead of regular ""spongey"" type that is standard and add peanuts), Buddha's Feast (plenty of great vegetables) and Ma Po Tofu (prefer that tofu be stir fried well done rather than soft or with five spice tofu.)  I also special request (not on menu) pan fried noodles with five spice tofu.  It comes with chewy egg noodles and a variety of vegetables...a bit high in sodium but I don't order it every time!There is also a good variety of small plates, which seem to be the trend these days as restaurants offer more ""tapas"" type dishes.  The Orange Ginger Edamame and wok-seared spinach with garlic are very good...Crispy Green Beans (Shamefully) delicious with a spicy dipping sauce, Kale & Quinoa Dip (non-fat yogurt blended with shallots, garlic, cilantro and lemon juice) served with sesame-seasoned wonton chips...and I often order (also not listed on menu) a ""Half-order"" of garlic snap peas.  SERVICE:  Good--tiered between your main server and a back server who delivers your food.  On the whole, any issues that may arise are addressed swiftly and satisfactorily--IF you raise them to the attention of your server.  Two of my ABSOLUTE FAVORITE servers are Tamara (very sweet...remembers my preferences so well she sometimes catches an omission in my order!) and Curtis (who also bar-tends and could do stand-up comedy!)HEALTH INSPECTION RATINGS: If you've ever worked in the industry (or tuned into one of Ramsey's shows...Yikes!) you know that environmental health inspections are a VERY IMPORTANT to safeguarding PUBLIC HEALTH...your very LIFE can depend upon it!  I looked at PFCB EH ratings all the way back to 2008 and found that all but one (2012 ""B"") inspection rating was at an ""A"" level.  More particularly, of 22 inspections done, PFCB received a score of ""95"" and above more than half of the time (12 times.) While I am not an expert, I will point out something that many people may not realize...in Riverside, unlike in school, an ""A"" or ""90+"" restaurant inspection rating means a ""PASSING"" grade ONLY...and health inspection rating meaning, frequency and regulations can VARY from County to County.    This is VERY important to me as I try to eat only at restaurants that score in the mid to high 90s. PRICES: Prices may be a bit higher than average but Hours of Happy (HoH) (3-6 PM, M-Fri) prices can bring down your average cost to a more reasonable level and, frankly, the food quality, handling and peace of mind make it a good value for me. (I do wish there was more than ONE vegetarian option on the HoH menu!)  On the negative side, I'm not happy about PFCB's decision to make HoH available only in the bar and patio.  I generally go for dinner and would prefer to be seated in a booth for both HoH appetizers and dinner, particularly since summers are blazing hot in Riverside and (in stark contrast to other locations that make patio seating interesting such as Waikiki, Fashion Island and Las Vegas) the patio overlooks a parking lot and the 91 freeway off ramp! Still, it IS my VEGETARIAN HAPPY PLACE!!!",92503

It's always perfectly flavorful and spicy, without being too greasy and heavy. The tofu lettuce wraps are also to die for, they're packed with protein, low calorie, and DELICIOUS! The best part about this visit: I have a 1 pound puppy that I can't leave by himself, and they let me eat with him in the outside seating area. They even brought out a small to go bowl with water in it for him! I always receive the absolute best service at this location, which always leaves me in a good mood.

2107,"3475 Tyler St Riverside, CA 92503",Shelley G.,"San Gabriel, CA",3/3/2014,1,"UMM where are all my people at? Sorry, my friend and I (both Asian) felt so out of place here. This place is a Chinese restaurant,  I at least expect some Asian customers/workers, did not see any (sadly). Well other than the atmosphere being awkward, the place wasn't busy on a Monday night. You can tell since we found parking right outside the door. As we walked in, there was no greeter to greet us. We waited a bit till someone greeted us and ask us a table for how many. We said 2, she said five minutes. So we sat down, my friend looked around, there was a lot empty tables, so I did not understand why we had to wait, but oh wells. We finally got our table, and the greeter gave us our menu and then asked if we wanted chopsticks. We said yes, and then she opened this box for us to grab our chopsticks, I found that interesting. After she took my order of a Chang's Mai Tai, my friend and I looked through the menus. I didn't know what to get because I grew up in a family where my father cooked these kind of food and I did not want to get something that would disappoint. So we I finally decided. Our server came to get our orders, we ordered Crispy Honey Chicken and Singapore Street Noodle. Apparently each dish comes with a side of white or brown rice, so we got one of each. After our waiter taken our orders, he came back with my drinks and gave us 3 sauces; dumpling sauce (taste like the soy sauce that is on Ha Churn/shrimp or beef noodle at Dim Sum), hot mustard and chili paste. He even offer to mix some of the sauces for us, so nice. A few minutes later, our food came out. I have to say, pretty fast service. For the food, all I can say is EHH. The Crispy Honey Chicken had no honey flavor but the chicken tasted real, not like the one from McDonald's Nuggets. As for my Singapore Street Noodle, no flavor, sighh. Also the rice that comes with the dish was so dry and hard, it had to be old rice and not fresh one. Luckily I didn't have high expectation about this place, I mean, this is a high end ""Chinese food restaurant"", I expected something good and awesome. Very disappointed, for the price you pay, you would expect something good, but you wont find that here. Save your money and go somewhere else, heck Panda Express is even better than this.At least I gave this place a try, I won't be coming back here again.",92503

Surf n turf had maybe 1/4 of a fillet in it, one tiny fake lobster (crawfish) and a whole bunch of battered frozen shrimp. For $24 I'd expect at least a full steak. All of the portions seemed small and if I am not mistaken I think all of these meals are prepackaged and just ""woked"" up to thaw them out. Very disappointed that P.F. Chang's would sell out.

Well that is what she did...the employee's name is Kylee and she was the sweetest, classiest respectful girl, so apologetic as well and giving kind words about ""how good her co workers are and they are so sorry.""'

A waitress without saying a word dropped off some soy sauce at our table and walked away. STILL WAITING. Ten minutes pass and not one person has come to our table to greet us and take our order. THEN, a family gets seated right next to us and greeted by a waitress within 30sec...... I said, ""Okay, we are leaving."" On our way out, I let the manager know about our experience. She asks us if we would like to sit down AGAIN and eat. No, thank you. I will, however, take your corporate number and your name please.

This is rather a review of how our food was cooked vs how it was priced. 7 items for $100.00. Lobster fried rice was bland portion of the lobster tail was small almost like a giant shrimp. Lemon grass chicken salad for $12 was a joke, 3 tiny slivers of grilled chicken and greens that u can count individually cause there was not many, Singapore chicken for $17 that was not even wok cooked and their motto was ""farm to wok"" is a joke. Orange peel shrimp $18 was the most insulting of them all. Frozen small shrimp that looked like someone went to the asian store and bought an over the counter sauce and tossed it in the pan with frozen shrimp. Street noodles for $13 was the most craziest thing ever. Vermicelli Noodles that are tossed in with lemon, green onion, and peanuts that was just awful and felt like a little kid playing cook put together. Last but not least the 3 pcs of battered fried chicken for kids for 6 bux. The batter was more than the chicken itself. I am not sure how they can get away with serving something like this. I can honestly say PANDA EXPRESS is way more of an asian experience than this place. The nerve to charge for ridiculous food just cause your in a restaurant setting . I eat at a lot of places in different settings and this by far is my worst EVER in terms of food / price. You get what you pay for they say and in this case i really really really did NOT get what i paid for.",92503

Tonight my party of three ordered the Beef and Broccoli, Honey Chicken, and Buddha's feast. The B&B and BF were excellent. The issue I had was with the portion size on the Honey Chicken. The meat barely covered half the plate, which seemed small compared to the other dishes (especially considering the price of the plate). Normally, I'd let it slide, but the last few times I've gone, I had also been disappointed with the portions on some of the plates. So, I said something to the wait staff. They were amazing. They came out with a new freshly prepared plate with a good portion. Very professional. If give 5 stars just for the staff, but I have to deduct one because it seems to be a recurring issue.

Chang's came up.  We looked at their online menu and we were pleasantly surprised with the number of gluten free items on their menu.  We had never been to a PF Chang's before.So we went there, taking our celiac son.  He was so excited to order from their gluten free menu.  Most places have 1 or 2 options, but this place had a LOT.  :)So he polished off his appetizer, chicken lettuce wraps, and got about 1/2 way done with his entree, shrimp in lobster sauce, when i heard an employee talking about the ingredients in the sauce....RED FLAGS went off in my brain and i pulled out our NIMA machine to start testing the food.GLUTEN!  :(  We were heartbroken.  We trusted that their gluten free menu would be gluten free...and it was not.  :(  Stupid me!  I should know better than to have not tested it first.  So my son immediately went into the rest room and made himself throw up, getting the food out of himself as quickly as he could before he started digesting it.  :(I showed the NIMA machine to the manager and our waitress, they seemed concerned...but honestly....they aren't making the food....they just use the recipes given to them by corporate.  So I explained that perhaps ""corporate"" needs to get itself a NIMA machine and test for glutens....BEFORE listing items as gluten free.  :(One thing that I noticed...I think that the manager thought she was doing something nice by taking our son's food off of the bill.....no, that was expected.  I think it would have been nice had she not charged us for any of the food.  My husband was about 1/3 into his food when he got up from the the table and went into the rest room to help our son for the next 20 minute.  Did the manager think that we really enjoyed our evening by having this happen...and leaving most of the food on the table....cold?  Not sure the hubby would really want to sit back down and polish off a meal after 20 minutes of helping our son vomit.  :( Then they asked if we wanted to take the all of our food home with us...uh...sure...since we paid for it.  And when we got home we just threw it away....it was very upsetting for this to happen to my son.  It will be too soon if we ever see a PF Chang's again.  :(No, we will not be returning to this restaurant.",92503

Everything tasted extremely salty. Not sure if my palette has changed or altered, but would have to say the food was not as stellar as previous visits. My also 2nd favorite is the sesame chicken. The lo-mien is a good noodle option especially if you had kids that love noodles. Portions are small but that's typical P.F Chang's. Service was okay - nothing great but nothing bad to say either. Had to wait around 15 minutes for a table on a Sunday evening which wasn't the worst thing, but I did notice alot of tables empty, so not sure why there was a wait.

I spoke with the waiter about it and he told me they weigh it for each dish . I wasn't buying that answer! So we ended up ordering another dish. I will say the waiter was very nice and attentive with us. I know it wasn't his call. I did get a chance to talk with the manager and I got the feeling that her attitude was ""dry"" and she seemed like she really didn't care. Other than that it's a great restaurant with a nice vibe.

I signed up to their email list and am always receiving great deals like free sushi rolls, buy one entree get one free, or a percentage off on my takeout bill. I am not ashamed to say I probably eat here at least twice a week. They have low carb meals and great protein options that won't clog your arteries. The egg drop soup is one if my favorite options and it's a savory starter. But really ALL their food is really good.

Food was delicious.  Except for the Singapore street noodle. It was yo salty. I recommend for the best vibe to come after 8:30pm. The rush crowd dies down and you get more of a chill vibe. All in all its worth it. You can have 4 people eat for like $50 bucks. Get the two for one special. I think it's called meal for two. 4 people can eat very good for this special.,92503

But they had two takeout employees and this young man and his counterpart had read my order and missed a few items so I addressed it and after a few more minutes they got it. I get home and realize they got my orange chicken as an orange shrimp dish and also forgot two sides of white rice, My son doesn't like shrimp so I called and tried to tell the employee, before I could finish what went wrong w my order he transferred me to a manager and then I waited 17 minutes and idk how many seconds on hold and I just gave up because my fam decided they didn't like it and I hung up and we ordered PANERA instead. After spending $ 150 we didn't eat the food and spent more money somewhere else. Also I'm in the restaurant industry so I understand certain things, I even tipped the to go crew 20%.

Second of all, I have a rewards card that gives me discounts/free appetizers here. I asked the waiter if we can use it, and he said yes. Then when we gave it to him, he said they do not accept them. He quickly became very defensive. I dropped it because I did not want to make a scene....and he CALLED THE MANAGER. I believe that was unnecessary.

The parking lot is a bit congested and small considering it's next to the Galleria Mall. It was a Friday night around 8p and the wait was around 45 mins. We kept our eye on the bar area and luckily 2 seats opened up after about 20 mins so we grabbed them. The bar was pretty busy but service was still pretty good considering the bar area. The sushi was delicious and very fresh and I love that fresh taste which is a plus for me. We ordered the spicy tuna roll, shrimp fried rice, and the fried green beans. PF change has the best fried rice. So if you go be sure to ordered some kind of fried rice and pick chicken or shrimp! I had a glass of moscato wine which was great (Stella Rosa was the brand I believe) and b/f ordered a Malibu coconut rum mixed drink. He ordered 2 and said the 2nd one was better than the first. Overall good experience for dinner/ happy hour on a Friday night and a plus that the bathrooms were clean! So a tip if you don't want to wait 45 mins keep an eye out for seats to open at the bar because you can still order from the full menu there to.",92503

It was not the same....different menu, Mongolian beef was a poor grade of beef and over cooked, even the brown rice was not as tasty.  I will say the chicken lettuce wraps were still great, however, the chicken seemed different.

So he tells me... babe call it in to do a Togo order, will pick it up on our way to the store. Alright so i did. Called got a recording of the options to push. 1 was for info, 2 was for order didn't bother to hear the rest. Pushed 2 got a pleasant female voice hi my name is Jessica, I have your previous order here would you like that, I thought ""oh wow"", they keep a record of it. Mr.GC said, ""can we hear it?""I had her on speakerphone. She replies, ""yes of course."" We pretty much wanted the same thing as last time but I wanted to change mine too the Hokkine Street noodles. We asked her what is pick up time and that's when we got into a problem. It was about 9:15 and they closed at 10. She said the pick time would be tomorrow morning. We laughed and said ok,but that isn't gonna do... she responds with let me put u on hold and figure it out. So what else could we say but ok. Mind you we have done a togo order before and had been already driving to the location. It takes about 15-20 min from our location to the restaurant. We were on hold all the way and until we decided to just walk in and seat our happy little asses at the bar. Lol... by then I hung up ,but we asked the server if our order had gone through he checked and said no. We explained the situation and then he said I'm sorry about that, but probably was the call service PFChang uses. I told him the girls name who took our order and he said yeah we don't have an employee of that name. Both Mr.GC and I were like wow that is interesting, the server said yeah, he said if you want to make an order to push 3 and it goes directly to the location you want.  The guy was real cool at explaining the whole thing. We learned something new. It made me think what other Togo order restaurant are using a call center to place our order and to keep tabs on our meals. Totally Big Brother in the sky.",92503

There are so many better gormet Chinese restaurants out there and it bothers me that so many people claim to like this place.The service at this particular place is good, but the food isn't worth the money you will have to dish out.I feel like this is a restaurant you take someone on a date to so they think you are cultured and have a little bit of money. If your date has bad taste your rouse will work.Spend your hard earned money somewhere that is worth it (not here).

So we decided to go to PF Chang's here by the Tyler mall. First we ordered the lettuce wraps and specified that we wanted the trio sauces with them. When the runner dropped off our lettuce wraps, he rudely ran away as my husband was trying to ask him for the sauces. We tried to get someones attention for about 5-10 mins and no one would give us the time of Day. There is no teamwork or hospitality here. Finally, we get our sauces and eat our lettuce wraps with cold chicken. The chicken lettuce wraps were bland and seemed to be missing an ingredient. The chicken usually is minced in small pieces, but we got big chunks of chicken. Next we ordered the Orange Shrimp. It was soggy and the sauce tasted bland as well and had a chunk of tofu in it. I also order the egg drop soup and the eggs were thick and looked more like dumplings. As I was eating my soup I bit into something hard. It was a bunch of eggs shells!! I'm not kidding, I'm not making this up. I wish I had taken a picture. I showed the manager and she said she would take it off the bill for me as if she was doing me a favor. I asked if her chefs were new and she got defensive. Nothing we ordered tasted like PF Chang's quality. Nothing we ordered here, not the Lettuce wraps, orange shrimp, even the green beans were not up to par. To top it off there was no comp to our bill. The manager acted as if she had done us a favor taking off the soup with egg shells in it and the shrimp that tasted horrible. She comped us nothing. The least she could have done was offer us a $2 dessert or a drink to get the bits of egg shells out of my mouth. But she was too offended that I asked if her chefs were new.

The waitress did not bat an eye as to how much dirt was obviously on the napkin we used to clean it. Utensils came out dirty. Our waitress was also snobbish and uncaring. My bro asked for a drink with no response, so he repeated his request, only to get an answer, ""I heard you,"" from the waitress. Very snippy.  She definitely should not work with people or at least in the line of customer service. The food was average.  Curry was definitely overlooked and vegetables wilted.

My friend Fran and I arrived early before our friend Linda.  We were offered a booth.  We sat down.  Our waiter came over promptly.  We advised him we were waiting for a third party.  He offered to take our drink orders.  Fran ordered the Mai Tai.  Since I was undecided I told the waiter to come back for my drink order. The Mai Tai was potent and very good. After  my extensive review of their drink menu I chose a Hefeweizen.  $6 for a 16 ounce tall glass.  Fran decided to exchange her drink.  The waiter suggested a pear mojito.  It was not quite as strong which is waht Fran wanted.  Linda arrived and ordered iced tea. We placed our food orders.  I ordered the two piece egg roll.  Fran ordered a salad and the Linda ordered soup.  I ordered the lettuce wraps appetizer as my entree. Fran had the broccoli beef while Linda chose steamed dumplings.  Our waiter placed our order.  About 10 to 15 minutes later another wait staff brought my lettuce wraps and my friend's broccoli beef and the dumplings. I had asked for my egg rolls first, Fran asked for her salad and Linda her soup.  We got our meals in reverse order.  When our waiter came over we let him know of the mix up.  About 5 minutes later the manager came over and greeted us.  When he asked how everything was I told him of the mix up.  He asked what he could do to make it up to us, and he apologized.  I said you can give us a dessert.  He said certainly and it is on the house.  Our waiter came back and explained that the staff was changing over from lunch kitchen staff  to dinner kitchen staff.  He also apologized profusely.  We finished our meals.  I had a doggy box for my leftovers.  The waiter brought us a dessert plate with tiramisu, chocolate peanut butter cake and a caramel dessert.  My friend Linda ordered a slice of the great wall of China chocolate cake.  It is six layers.  Fran and I ate the caramel dessert and the tiramisu.  We asked for a doggy box for the third dessert.  Linda said her chocolate cake was a little on the dry side.  Fran took it home.All in all the food was great despite the mix ups.  The waiter was very professional and the manager did not blink an eye in giving us a complimentary dessert.  I do not frequent this particular chain restaurant very often, but I will certainly visit again in the future.",92503

The veggie lettuce wraps were fresh and tasty but a little too salty. The crispy green beans is a must! Excellent with their spicy dipping sauce. I couldn't decide between their northern style ribs(dry) and their bbq style ribs(saucy) and asked the server for her opinion. She recommended the northern style ribs. It consisted of a plate of 4 ribs and came with dry spice on the side. I thought the meat was on the dry side and needed sauce to add moisture and tenderness to the meat. The most disappointing item was the ahi tartare. Presentation was beautiful and looked delicious but surprisingly, it was bland and salty! Definitely needed a creamy element to enhance the flavors. Our server was great(forgot her name) and gave us great service. I believe happy hour here is from 4-6pm. Overall, my meal was okay for a good price. Some items better than others. I would come back to try other items on their happy hour menu.",92503

The rolls were delicious and I love the sweet sauce ( some form of a Hoisin sauce) that they serve the California rolls on top of it was deliciously sweet but yet savory. The lobster rolls were delicious too but didn't care to much for the sauce on that one. I mean our wasn't bad or anything but I think I just fell in love with the sauce on the CA rolls. The walnut shrimp has always been one of my ho to favorites. I order it with extra sauce and melons. It's delicious with the white rice served with it. And the candies walnuts adds that much desired crunch as well as an offset delicate savory balance against the sauce and melons. Our server was a sweetheart and kept coming back to check on us to see if we needed anything. It's located eight in front of the Tyler mall facing the 91 fwy so you can't miss it.

Now this brings me to why my review is so low. After calling around on my bday my bestie called PF Changs and they agreed to make a reservation for a big party. They were even really helpful about bringing extra chairs when some friends showed up last minute. I wasn't super hungry but knew I needed to eat something cause we were going to hit up some bars in DTF after, So me and a friend agreed to split and entree. Now mind you we and a another pair of friends asked our server if their entree portions were big enough to split and he assured us that they were. IT was extremely disappointing when my honey shrimp came out and by the time we split them we each got 6 measly tiny pieces of shrimp. I was still hungry when we left. Even my friends who didn't share were hungry after the meal.  The food portion size is definitely not worth what you pay for here. The birthday cheesecake slice was pretty good though so they get an extra star for that. And our server was really nice and accommodating.",92503

It gets better, the third waiter I asked was another different one and they still forgot. Eventually I had to get up myself and ask someone again until they finally brought it. Not ONCE did they come to check on us and ask how we are doing or if we needed anything. My boyfriends drink was empty for a while. It didn't even matter if the food was good or not because my mood was completely ruined to eat. I am never coming again. No wonder my boyfriend and I were the only Asians there, it sucks.

2242,"3475 Tyler St Riverside, CA 92503",Matthew F.,"Tustin, CA",1/3/2013,3,"Chang's can be special, or it can be nothing to right home about. This location fits solidly into the latter category.Service was friendly and responsive. Smiles all around, and attention to our table was never in question. The quality of the food was good, with the usual taste pleasers - namely salt and oil - included in abundance. For the uninitiated, this is how P. F. Chang's makes its Asian-Fusion trade: Dousing high-quality ingredients in stock, stimulating sauces.So, we got what we came for. As for whether we got what we paid for, that's where I find Chang's falls short. This joint really costs an arm and a leg, especially considering that their ""cafeteria style"" branch, Pei Wei, gives you the same manner of food for half the price. To wrap it up, come to Chang's for high-priced and well-sauced American-Chinese, or do your homework and find a more authentic joint for far less.",92503

When i say the server had the worst attitude of all she really did, it was the worst service , we then got another manager because the service was just bad everybody around us was getting served but although Jenny did not ask if our food was tasting great,  she kept walking around cleaning tables looking up at the world it's right I will never be back and as for Jenny I hope she has a better day probably won't but I hope she has a better shift last but not least a different manager had came over Becca use I had to ask again,  the whole experience sucked she then nitpicked at the bill and only took off two items when I believe she should've taken care of everything after the whole visit we went through she then mentioned that someone had passed away from the restaurant that was very important I don't know if it was Mr. Chang himself or if it was somebody I'm not sure but that is not an excuse here.

Very rarely does someone post a review for mediocre service or good service for that matter. Tonight's visit started off great, the wife, the 8-week year old baby, and myself, decided to try PF Changs, our first time. We recently purchased our home and need a spot to call our own.Parking was horrendous, not to PF Changs fault; just the mall has really poor parking. We were greeted promptly by the hostess, and taken to our seats' within 5 minutes. Our server, Vanessa, was professional and nice. My wife has been dying to drink a piña colada since giving birth 8 weeks ago, and the whole 9 months without alcohol I can only imagine 'kinda' sucks; needless to say, it was one of things she was looking forward to tonight -she forget her ID in the car. I asked the server if she could let it slide, and she decided to check with her manager-good call on her part. Of course her manager, Lance, came over and personally told us no, that they have a liquor license and certain laws in place require them to ask for ID. I rebutted yes and no, the law in place is set to prevent minors from drinking, which is the letter of the law, not the spirit. Of course I ran out to the parking lot about 300 feet away, again parking sucks, and grabbed the ID.After about five minutes and a couple sips of my mojito I calmed down and thanked him for telling us personally instead of sending the server. The appetizer came out and it was great, I would definitely recommend the pork dumplings to anyone. My wife did get her piña colada and... it... was... awesome! The over all night was a success, nothing bad nothing terrible. However, the personal touch that the MOD showed went a long way tonight. I'm happy PF Changs employs professionals like Lance and Vanessa and I will be coming back for that reason. Overall a great experience.My breakdown is as follows:Food 4/5Service 5/5Ambiance 5/5Noise level 3/5Parking 1/5Overall 3.5, but since I can leave half stars, we round up.",92503

After just a short wait my mother and I had the pleasure of having Jose as our server. I say it was a pleasure because he was winderful. Found out after our dinner service that it was only his 3rd day working for P.F. Changs.  We started off with their lettuce wraps and although it took some time to get them they were delicious and worth the waith. Once our entrée's came I didn't know where to begin. Had a little shrimp pad tai, lemon chicken, shrimp and candied walnuts and pepper beef. Everything was absolutely amazing , the lemon chicken had such a strong lemon flavor, the pepper beef was so tender and the shrimp with candied walnuts was out of this world.... it even had melon balls in it that were so flavorful. This was definitely one of the best dining experiences. As we were leaving the manager asked us how everything was and after expressing our feelings my mother mentioned this was my first visit to a P.F. Changs. When she heard that she said HOLD ON.... DONT GO ANYWHERE and she took off towards the back of the house. Moments later she came out with an envelope and in the envelope was a card welcoming me to P.F. Changs and information on how I could let them know how my visit was and a $10.00 gift card to start a wonderful relationship.I thought this was an awesome touch.I will definitely be back soon!",92503

2273,"3475 Tyler St Riverside, CA 92503",Russell G.,"Murrieta, CA",11/6/2016,2,"I am writing to complain about a very bad experience at P.F. Chang's in Riverside. On the way back from funeral for a 19 year old girl, we stopped for a meal at the store in Riverside. We were obviously not in the best of spirits already, at the time. First of all, the Manager came to see how we were ""doing"" AND inform us that the New Brussels Spouts were not available. We ordered the Spinach and we were a bit disappointed, but I guess these things happen. Then, the experience went from mere annoyance to absolute anger. When the 3 entrees arrived, we asked the server about our two Hot and Sour soups and Edamame. Those that had never arrived. The Manager stopped by and informed us we would not be charged for them. Damn right, since we never got them! No offer of any type was made to us to make up for the confusion with our soups and Edamame which we never received, ERROR #2. We then cancelled those 3 items.        The server then proceeded to be very rude, clearing our plates, refilling drinks and not speaking to us because we had dared to complain about our missing items. ERROR #3 She finally did speak to us when we finished, offering to give us a box for leftovers. We were so put out after such a poor experience, one of the guests asked for the Manager when the meal was done. He did come over and finally offered to pay for the meal, which he did. By that time our evening was ruined. This softened the blow, but did NOT erase this negative meal.       None of this ever had to happen! Had the confusion between Server and Runner been rectified, when it happened, we would have been fine with it. The offer by the Manager to take off the three items we never got, only fueled our anger more. While we eventually received the entire meal as complimentary, but the experience was far from satisfying. I hope their training does not advise this kind of response by Employees and Managers. I don't judge an establishment by IF they make errors, we all do, but how they correct them. Our expectations were not met throughout the entire time there. The meals are not inexpensive, $15 - $20 per plate, so our Customer Service standards are little higher than a fast food place. I do have to say the food is pretty good; however, the service we had this week was the absolute worst.",92503

They were pretty good but the tacos are kind of awkward mix with Chinese and Mexican... I mean it could have been executed differently for different results. My little sister really liked the wontons though, she even ordered another plate. We then ordered the shrimp with lobster sauce and a plate of veggie lo mein noodles, they were tasty also just enough food to fill everyone up and walk out happy :) my mom said it was inexpensive so that's good. Ima have to come back here when debating on where to eat some other time. It can be hard to think of good places to eat in the i.e when I'm feeling picky.

2282,"3475 Tyler St Riverside, CA 92503",Alaria R.,"Riverside, CA",5/13/2013,3,"I have always wanted to go here since they opened up in Riverside but didn't have that chance until Saturday (for dinner).  The restaurant is very nice looking, a lot of detail obviously went into the general design...which gives it a classy feel.  I almost jumped up on the horse out front for a picture but thought it unwise in a skirt (which would have taken away from the classy feel I suppose).However I'm slightly disappointed with the food.  It wasn't BAD by any means and even the service was good BUT, I had the ""dumplings"" which taste just like those frozen potstickers from the grocery store (aka nothing special and over-priced).  I also had the Moo Goo Gai Pan which although I liked it, tastes extremely similar to Campbell's cream of chicken (yep, again nothing special and overpriced).  The Egg drop soup was pretty good though, albeit much thicker than my husband has ever made.  The spinach with garlic however tasted like soggy heated up spinach with a garlic aroma.  I had to cover it in vinegar to choke some of it down.The service was decent.  We had a to flag our waitress down once (although we were waiting on others in the party so I can't blame her for feeling the need to not check back until they were seated).  And they did sell my sister the 2 for $40 selection but had priced the items as single item purchases which actually cost her $48; however, a call to management fixed that very quickly.  And for some reason, when we asked the waiter for the lid to the cake we brought, we all sat around wondering if he pulled it out of the trashcan...it may have been a joke at first but no one wanted another piece of cake after that comment...I think we all would have felt better had they brought the cake out with the lid and left it on the lil table they had to box all of the leftover food.So yes, 3 out of 5 stars because the food was nothing special and they charge you like it would be.  Dragon House and Panda Express have better deals and if you want more 'authentic' Chinese food, Dragon House all the way.  Or maybe just the lunch specials would be worth it at P. F. Chang's...",92503

We were seated right away but the table we wanted was clean but the floor around was a mess. The Host had to come and sweep the floor. Vanessa our server was Amazing. She was super helpful and accommodating since it was our first time. Probably one of the best service we had. Food was great a bit overpriced. Service made it worth while.

2284,"3475 Tyler St Riverside, CA 92503",Jonathan L.,"Lake Elsinore, CA",2/16/2014,2,The servers and food were excellent .. Something you would expect from PF Changs. However the management... Particularly the manager Lance is lazy. Stands in one place sipping on his blended beverage while there were tables to be bussed. People leaving because of service. I see more employees in the back than on the floor.. manager should be taking care of the customers and not socializing and being a wall flower in a facility that needs them to be a manager.,92503
2285,"3475 Tyler St Riverside, CA 92503",Lulu S.,"Manhattan, NY",12/29/2014,1,"Food is horrible.  My appetizer was calamari and it was a small portion for almost $9.  Definitely not worth it.  Usually calamari are rings of fried squid, but their calamari are small strips.  They basically cut the rings of fried squid up to make it look as if they put a lot of squid.  For entree, I got the Singapore Street Food noodles for $12 and it tastes like just noodles with soysauce.  Very salty and no other tastes whatsoever.  The customer service is one the worst that I've ever gotten.  We waited 30 minutes to be seated.  It was a busy night and I saw a lot of people waiting, so I didn't complain.  But what really upsets me is our waitress.  After we finished our meal, we waited around for almost 20 minutes!  The waitress didn't come to check if we finished our meal.  We kept looking for her to get her attention.  Finally we found her and asked for our check.  I was irritated by that time and started looking at my watch.  Another 20 minutes pass by and she still hasn't gotten back to us with our check!  At that point, I just lost my patience and walked up to the hostess at the front of the restaurant and asked her to get our waitress.   The hostess acted shocked that we weren't able to pay for 40 minutes after our meal.  Finally the hostess got the check for us.  The waitress didn't even come back to apologize.   I would have just written a note about how bad her service is on the check and not even leave a tip.  But my boyfriend still left a $5 bill as a token of tips because he felt bad for not leaving anything.  I will never come back especially for that kind of customer service.  Please train your employees better and never leave a customer waiting for more than 10 min for a check!",92503

We ordered online, drove and picked it up. I ordered a bottle of Fiji water and the server forgot my water, luckily I hadn't pulled away yet so I called and she brought one out. When I got the order home we were so stunned at the poor quality of our food. First, the portions were tiny. And I rarely complain about this. The containers were all hardly half-full. The crispy honey chicken was missing the sweet crunchy noodles that are usually underneath. My husband ordered lettuce wraps and there was no lettuce to be found. And finally, the brown rice was completely raw. It was dry and crunchy. I was so appalled I called the restaurant. I got a completely complacent manager on the phone, who sounded like he could care less about the mistakes made. He did not apologize but took down my address to send me a giftcard.A few weeks later it arrived for $25. We spent over $65 on our terrible meal. What a joke.",92503

The service was ok , our server seemed like he didn't want to be there ,he probably had a rough day.All though  in a establishment like this one a server would put in that extra effort to satisfy their customers for that extra tip but it seemed dull and awkward at times but that is  a different story. 2 to 3 hours later my family had stomach pains, loose-motion and really bad gas. You know its all bad after you eat something that doesn't settle right in your tummy.  I will be looking out for other Yelpers and their thoughts about this establishment before I return, no time soon though !

Food and service is always great here so we even celebrate big group events here sometimes. We all know that no restaurant is perfect and food does not come as expected sometimes but what makes PF Chang rise above the rest is how they handle customer issues. On one occasion, we ordered two sea bass and one came overcooked and undersized compared to the other. I reported this to the manager Cameron who apologized and emphasized. He promised to correct the issue and he did in flying colors a he delivered a new sea bass  cooked to perfection and melt in your mouth. My sea bass craving was satisfied and our server Carlos even sent us a delicious new dish at no cost. We are very happy indeed and will definitely come back.",92503

I usually go for the authentic Chinese food, you know steamed fish, garlic crab, peking duck with the head on the plate. The seafood I eat is swimming minutes before they pull it out of the tank. So for me PF Changs is not that interesting. So in order to get a good sample I ordered several dishes, lettuce cups, garlic noodles, stir fried eggplant, chengdu spiced lamb,salmon steamed with ginger. The dishes had flavor, but not what I desire wen I eat chinese food. I guess I need to realize not everyone wants authentic, this place was packed, and everyone looked like they enjoyed their meals. As for the service, it was good. They refilled our delicious jasmine blackberry green tea several times, and the food arrived hot in a timely manner. I'm thinking I might go back again if I can get it through my head this is Asian Fusion not Chinese food.",92503

When I told her everything that went wrong, she fixed my bill and that was that. When I left, I saw her in the parking lot smoking... Again.

2303,"3475 Tyler St Riverside, CA 92503",Rebecca N.,"Portland, OR",10/30/2010,2,"I've only been here twice and I'm not a big fan of it. I mean I do understand that the place is an Asian Fusion restaurant, but the food kind of sucks. The place looks awesome. Walking towards the entrance, there are these huge horse statues, that really don't look anything from the Asian culture at all. Haha...but it looks cool. Inside is really nice. It's dimly lit. All the tables have a cute candle, there is a huge landscape painting on the wall. The place looks really sophisticated. The service was good. All of our food came in a timely manner. The waitress was super nice. She did this little cool demo thing about making the special sauce (soy sauce, vinegar, sugar, chili, spicy mustard), which turned out to be pretty good tasting.  The boyfriend and I did the dinner for two for $39.95. Which gives you a full size appetizer, full size entree meals, and 2 mini desserts. For the appetizer we got the salt and pepper calamari. It was good, but it didn't really stand out to me. There entree meals are kind of like family style. We got the kung pao chicken and crispy honey chicken. The kung pao was probably the worst kung pao I have ever ate. It was so salty. On a scale of 1 to 10 for saltiness it was like an 8. I happened to like the crispy honey chicken, but I don't know if I liked it because it curbed the salty taste from the salty kung pao or because it actually tastes good. And lastly for dessert, the waitress brought out this rack of 8 mini desserts and they you guys choose 1 for yourself. I chose the tiramisu and the boyfriend got the raspberry chocolate cake. The tiramisu was okay, I've tasted better. This wouldn't be a place I would like to visit again unless I had to. I mean I can head over to Dragon House like 3 minutes away, off of Magnolia, to get better Chinese food.",92503

2305,"3475 Tyler St Riverside, CA 92503",ciara c.,"Temecula, CA",12/19/2010,3,"Husband and I have eaten here a few times. Why have I not reviewed PF's before?! Anyway, after some holiday shopping at Tyler Galleria (see review on the mall), Americanized Asian food sounded great. It also helped we had a gift card to use there. We got there around 8pm and had a 25 minute wait. No spots at the bar so we sat down on one of the benches in the hallway. The couple on the bench across from us was a bit off putting. Yes, ok, this is a tangent, however, this was part of our experience. My husband and I were talking. They were talking, too, then all of a sudden started madly making out. Eh..hem. So to them, we didn't exist. Ok, hope the rest of the night went well Mr. and Ms. Public Smoochy Pants. Got to our table. Waiter was friendly, though pretty laid back. We opted for the prix fixe, which some people say you should never do at a restaurant. Some of the items we ordered with the prix fixe were good, others need to be thrown in the dumpster behind the restaurant for the raccoons. To start the selections on the prix fixe, you get 2 orders of soup. I opted for the Hot & Sour, my husband got the Egg Drop. These are standard Asian soups and not very easy to screw up. The Hot & Sour soup was screwed up. The chef may have been fond of BBQ sauce because that was the flavor of the soup. Oh, and it also contained a few pieces of reconstituted chicken, of which I've never seen chicken, nor reconstituted in this kind of soup. I don't eat poultry or red meat so luckily I caught the meat as I put it in my mouth and was able to spit out. Nowhere on the menu does it say what's in the soups. Shared the calimari for an appetizer. It was just ok. For the entrees, I had the Cantonese shrimp and he ordered the Kung Pao Chicken. Cantonese shrimp was the best part of the meal. It came with crisp snow peas and small pieces of asparagus in a light Asian wine sauce. What's nice is they also give you the option of choosing white or brown rice with your entree. So with a good score for the entree, here comes the coup de gras of awfulness. You're allowed to choose two of six ""desserts."" What might be a savory apple pie or a cheesecake is served in the form of a glop inside of an enlarged test tube. Normally, I don't order dessert, however, since it came as part of the meal, I thought ""I'd try a taste...maybe get hooked."" Not this time. I opted for the tiramisu. If you find yourself in this situation, just don't. The top ""layer"" of the tiramisu tasted like rubbery whipped cream with fake sugar. The only good part of this dessert was a small piece of chocolate made to look like a coffee bean. My husband had a ""chocolate mousse"" that was considerably better than the tiramisu, however, don't think that you'd be able to enter it in any French dessert competitions. Soooo, we may be back to Chang's though won't be doing the prix fixe. Guess it's true what they say.",92503

One appetizer dish may not fill you up, but two of them is definitely more than enough. Share with your wonderful company!

Because I'm Chinese to begin with I'm very critical of the food that I can cook on my own at home. However, coming to this restaurant was a great idea for a date.It was my first time here, and I loved it. The food came out tasting amazing, though after several bites it became very salty. Maybe it was because the dishes I ordered involved a lot of sauces? I'm not quite sure, it was different from the way I would cook it myself. None the less, we enjoyed our food. The dessert here is to DIE for. I never tasted such creamy blue berry cheese cake. The tiramisu was a bit frozen, but the cool feel made the taste much more enjoyable in the hot weather. When my waitress found out that it was my first time at the restaurant, she notified her manager who then came over to greet us and gave us a $10 gift card to come back again. Honestly, AMAZING way to end the meal. This spot is the best place to go for a date. You can easily walk around and just hit the shops after eating your meal and the area is beautiful.",92503

I went with a couple of friends who shared the lunch special for 39.95 they got chicken lettuce wraps for an appetizer, egg drop soup which one didn't eat, i was more then happy to take care of that for her. then they had the kung pao shrimp and Mongolian beef plates for their main course. and to Lil mini deserts. i had the spinach stir fried with garlic for an appetizer (which was super good with one of the condiments they had on the table. I don't know what it was but i know its not the siriacha hot sauce or the garlic it was like a mix) and the beef al la sichuan. they claim the sichuan to be there hottest dish, not very hot but still pretty good. Bad side was the beef plates we ordered claimed to be crispy... didn't know what to expect. they were just over cooked it seemed.  i was glad we were there when it wasn't to crowded, the dining room reminded me of a school cafeteria just a bunch of tables squished together unless your lucky enough to get a booth. that's why a weekday for lunch worked out nice hate to be there on a Friday or Saturday night though. Great part for me was there veggies, The julienne celery and carrots that came with my beef were delicious as well as my appetizer never loved the taste of spinach more. Reason for 3 stars instead of 4 was it was a Lil expensive. i know alot of places with equally good food for quite a bit less. the three of us paid $78.00 after tax and tip. and we drank water!",92503

We sat down to find dirty silverware and a dirty glass with food caked on it.  We exchanged our silverware and ordered soup the first soup came out thick and not hot. The second soup came out Luke warm right around then our appetizer hit the table cold as well. One of the soup bowls was caked with dirty food and the plate for the appetizer pot stickers was dirty as well. At this point we asked for a manager thinking like what's going on? Dirty dishes yuck! He came to the table and proceeded to let us know it's really strange the soup bowl was warm but the soup wasn't? We said feel the soup! He was not accommodating or helpful.  They brought out new soup and a new plate which WAS DIRTY AGAIN! They took that plate back and brought another new one! They never replaced our cold appetizer, never apologized and actually treated us like who cares! We come here a lot drive a  while to get here and just saying bad service rude manager cold food not a good combo ... think twice of your visiting riverside P.F. CHANGS.",92503

We waited almost an hour after being told 30 min wait. After being seated we waited an additional 10 minutes to get water. Our waiter took our order, asked if we wanted the child's meal to be brought out with our appetizers, we said yes. I also asked for 1 new clean plate, as one of ours was dirty. After 20 more minutes, server brings over our cold hard steamed dumplings and says ""I'm sorry I don't have the kids meal yet, but these have been sitting on the counter and so I figured I should just bring them. I don't know what happened with the kids meal"". Uh ok? During this time we had to ask another server to refill our water for us. About 10 minutes later, child's dinner came out, followed shortly afterwards with our meal. We never were offered larger dinner plates nor brought a clean appetizer plate. Our daughter was getting antsy, and not wanting to disrupt other diners, I asked our server as he passed by to plz bring my bill and package up my dinner. His response? "" I'll get back as soon as I can"".  We waited patiently until it arrived and another server packaged our dinners. Our bill was $49, so I gave my husband a $50 gift card to pay with and left the server a $9 tip. My husband waited for the server to complete the transaction while I took our daughter to the car. When I drove around to the front of the restaurant, my husband is standing out front waving to me - "" the waiter said there's no money on this card!"" I told him to pay with our Visa, and I called the number on back of card. Long story, but PF Changs customer service verified the correct balance and told me I could go back inside to get my Visa credited and the gift card applied towards my meal. I asked the rep to say of the cell phone with me to tell the manager and she agreed. My husband sat with daughter in the car and now I am back inside the restaurant. Customer Ser rep told me to ask for a manager, so I did. She waited on the phone for an additional 8 1/2 minutes. She asked ""Has a manager come yet?"" No. She then said she was tired of waiting and filed a complaint over the phone on my behalf. 3 minutes later a manager came over and I gave her my phone so rep could explain to her. She finally acknowledged my card had a balance and then ""comped"" my dinner. I was appreciative of that as we spent a total of 2.5 hrs there and I was taking my dinner home. This was on a Wednesday night. Not a busy weekend! Long story short - we came back with some friends 2 weeks later, and I was so lucky! Same server, same manager and same LOUSY service!

There were about 6 empty tables in the shade.  We asked if instead we could be seated in the shade seeing as how we have a young child.  She said she needed to go ask so that she ""wouldn't get in trouble"".  She came back and told us no, that it would be a 45-60 minute wait.  We left immediately.",92503

I loved trying the food and would definitely go back to try other things on their menu (and get more of the crab wontons which were amazing).However, the one thing that makes my visit not a 5 star was the waitress we had while we were there. She was very impersonal for most of our stay and a little on the rude side. She slammed down refills of my drink before I was even half way done with them without even saying ""oh, I see that your drink is getting low so I got you a refill"" which would have been nice. She seemed angry for being there and I just didn't understand what could have happened. Also, on the minor side of things, over half of the tables were clean and empty and it still took 20 minutes to seat us, but there could have been a reason (such as all the waitors attending to people already) to explain that...

The place exudes an atmosphere of calm that is appropriate for fine dining and intimate conversation. We ordered from the four-course ($40) menu to which we started with egg drop soups and chicken lettuce wraps. The latter was good though not surpassing the taste of the already made chicken lettuce wrap you can buy in stores. The main dishes took a bit of time,for reasons  unknown to us (the place was not packed at the time and i probably got used to the least waiting time in most chinese restaurants). Kung pao chicken and crispy honey shrimp with brown rice. The brown rice was dry and so was the kung pao chicken.They got my order wrong so they just gave us the other chicken (im guessing crispy honey chicken) dish while waiting for a few minutes for my order. These crispy honey shrimp and chicken did not offer anything special. We actually had many leftovers of all three and most of the rice. We had a good peanut butter crunch for dessert that was not too sweet and adequately sized for not doing over consumption. Overall, as much as I liked the service and the place, its the food that can invite me back. And we will not be coming back soon.

I really loved that after I called in my order all I had to do was drive up to a spot and they came out with my order and range me up. When we got home, I was pretty upset because I had ordered the hot and sour soup with chicken and it had zero chicken in it. I was irrationally upset, but tried to be calm as I called the restaurant. After all, I had given a $10 tip and expected my order to be checked.The manager seemed like he was condescending when he said in an exagerated way ""Oh Im Soooorry. I thought there was chicken in there. Hmm, Ill tell you what. Ill send you a gift card. Can I call you back tomorrow to get your address?"" I completely thought he was BS'ing me and I was not really amused. I told him that was fine, and then hung up.Now the food iteself was pretty darn good, the Orange chicken isn't breaded, a little spicey. The Beef with broccoli was good, hot and sour soup was way too salty and as I mentioned, it was missing the chicken. The following day the manager called, true to his word and got my address. A week later I had a gift card in hand. Great customer service, yummy food. I like this place.",92503

The Mongolian Beef was excellent.  The Sweet and Sour was good, but was a little heavy handed on the Ginger. I asked the server if it was normally like that. He told us that they make the ginger sauce fresh every day, so maybe we got a strong batch. We would order it again, but without the ginger sauce.

We dined at your Tyler location yesterday (May 16, 2013) and our experience was one of the worst ones we have encountered at ANY RESTURAUNT. When we were sat at our table, we waited 10 minutes before anyone greeted us. The person greeting us was the person that sat us not our server, she stated that our server was extra busy and that he would be by shortly. 20 minutes went by and Erny came by to take our order, he did not mention why it took him so long to get to us. There were a total of 5 tables in the whole restaurant so he could not have been very busy. Our food came out and the orange chicken was cold, our server was nowhere in sight. We just ate it because we didn't want to wait another 20 minutes for him to show up. Towards the end of our meal, Ernie shows up and asks if I want a refill noticing that my soda was all the way consumed. It took him about 10 minutes to get me a refill as he tended to all of his other tables first. When he brought me my refill I asked him for the check and to box up our leftovers. When he came back to box up our food he had his back turned towards us the whole time and was talking to someone in the kitchen across the whole dining room.I have never been treated so poorly by anyone at any establishment, until I visited your Tyler location.

And it was oversalted looked like almost a murky brown color like a swamp also it was not good at all! We asked them to make it less salty and our server said this was the bottom of the serving bowl and we were like oooo ok.. The second ""bowl"" they brought was just as salty if not more... Anyway my dish was just ok... I grew up eating authentic chinese food and this is definitely not... it was closer to panda express then a real chinese restaurant... not enough sauce for the rice and they basically just blanched or steamed the broccoli with no flavor... at least they were nice enough to take the hot and sour soup off the bill.. since my friend ate 1 bite of it... lol and just be aware she was sick at the time too so if you can taste the salt when you are sick then it will be EXTREMELY SALTY",92503

We are in a hotel and they didn't give us forks or napkins. Luckily we had some left o we from last nights dinner. The most disappoint part was the Mongolian beef. $22.50. Hubby didn't want any rice. Please see the photo. 1 1/2 cup of beef and green onions.  The one star is for the tender beef!I got Kung pao chicken and white rice.  It is good flavor.  At least better portion size!,92802

I ordered the miso butter lobster dumplings for an appetizer and chicken pad Thai. The waitress kept telling me they're still making the dumplings since they're hand made and may come out with my entree and that they'd be taken off my bill because of the delay. That upset me since this is an appetizer. The entrees come out and still no dumplings. I'm pretty much done with my entree and she finally comes out and says I won't be getting the dumplings and blamed the kitchen. As a customer I don't care who you want to blame, I don't have the item I ordered. A manager came around who just got there and didn't know anything about the situation. He never came back by the time we paid the bill. Considering we got there when they opened and were the first guests seated, the entire experience is not what I experienced from prior visits to this same location. I should've been offered a replacement appetizer option since they have other dumplings on the menu. So they removed something off my bill that I never received. :-(",92802

The workers are nice and trying their best to get people's orders and help them out any way they can.The food quality has some problems like the rice can be too mushy due to the amount of water in cooking the rice. The noodles remind me more of Panda Express. I enjoyed the best thing on the menu is the lettuce wraps which they are famous for. There can be long line to order and pick up food during dinner rush so just a heads up. I recommend going to another fast food Chinese place or family own Chinese restaurant for food.,92802

Food was surprisingly good (the aforementioned takeout meal was disappointing, and hence our surprise). The tonkotsu ramen was rich and creamy but not too overpowering. The Singapore street noodle was seasoned and cooked well, and the lettuce wrap was as good as always. Our only complaints were that the portions were very small for the rolls and the pad thai was a bit too sweet for our taste. Otherwise, it was a satisfying meal!

So when we went tonight and found everything completely different it was a bit disappointing. That being said the bartender did a great job on the drinks. What wasn't so great was the ""new recipe"" orange chicken...they added considerable spice and didn't mention anywhere. The biggest downer was our favorite.... Street noodles... they were inedible they were so salty. You couldn't taste anything because of the salt. The nail in the coffin was the COCKROACH falling from the ceiling and landing next to my drink and plate. That's when I got up and said nope... the manager was apologetic and blamed it on the open doors but falling from the ceiling is not open doors...he was nice enough to comp our entire bill but still...I just wish he had acted more surprised .... But what it told me was it was the first time.

We ordered a bottled water for the table because the place looked filthy and the glasses the waiter brought out looked and smelled as if they were pulled straight out from the dirty sink ... it was nauseating !!! We had to order 3 large water bottles for each of us just to feel SAFE !!! The chicken taste like eel ... it feel apart in your mouth it was DISGUSTING everything smelled like feet and for dessert we had a peace of cilantro with a hair on the spoon !!!!!!!!

We sat down and the server looked rushed and in a hurry. We waited awhile before we could place our first order for appetizers. He took our order and brought our drinks there over an hour and not once did he bring us refills but the server never came back to take our food order. He ran to every table but somehow forgot us. Also when appetizers were order they didn't bring extra plates, I guess we all had to eat off of one plate. Had to ask 3 times for plates so appetizers were a lil cold.

I would probably have given it 1 star had it not been for the charm and grace of a couple select staff members, who really tried to make an otherwise frustrating night bearable.Chicken Lettuce Wraps: Good salt but no seasoning whatsoever. Way too much water chestnut which significantly watered down the dish. WAY too much.Sweet Honey Shrimp: Low quality frozen shrimp in an undercooked batter, coated in what resembles an ""orange chicken"" sauce instead of honey sauce. Mushy and one dimensional. I ALSO FOUND A CHUNK OF CHICKEN MIXED IN, which is a HUGE red flag.Singaporean Noodles: There is actually no one culturally definitive ""Singaporean"" noodle, and even if there was, this wouldn't be it. Vermicelli was brittle and had no chew, and was still watery when served. The other components were just as forgettable. The lack of unison suggests that the ingredients were all cooked separately, and then thrown together at the end. Strawberry Limeade (spiked with gin): The first one came out watered down, weak, and sour, as did the second one after I sent the first one back. I ended up changing it for the Twisted Whiskey Sour, which actually quite decent.The food took very, very long to come out, despite the restaurant being only 2/3 full, on a Saturday night, in a Disneyland part of town.",92802

The vegetable lo mein was pretty generic and quantity was also very small.And that's where the flavor ended. We got the Kung Pao chicken and Mongolian beef as our entrees. Portion size for the entrees and rice were barely for two people. Both were extremely dry and lacked any flavor at all. I've had better tasting Chinese food at Panda Express. (Strike2)I would have been extremely pissed off if I had paid the full $62 plus $10 tip for this meal. But I had a $50 gift card that someone had given me for Christmas.

My friend and I came to this restaurant because most of the restaurant wasn't open, even tho all of them should be open. The interior decoration is nice. Asian Mac & Cheese: 5 stars, I recommend this dish. I am Asian but I have never eaten this. It's good tho. The ""Mac & Cheese"" is made of Korean rice cake, it makes it very chewy. Tokyo Udon Noodle Bowl: 2 stars, We'll it doesn't taste Japanese at all. It tastes very sour and salty. Korean Bibimbap: 3 stars, this is nothing like the Korean Bibimbap, it's more like American style Bibimbap. Basically there's only meat, sauce, pieces of veggie and an egg. Coconut drink: 2.5 stars, it tastes like coconut milk with tons of sugars. Waiters: 3 stars, very friendly but very very slow.",92802

It was already a red flag when we were the only Asians inside. We ordered some appetizers to share like the crispy green beans, Chang's lettuce wrap, and crab wontons. The only good one was the lettuce wrap. The green beans were definitely fried with old oil and the crab wontons were the worst that I've ever tried. My sister and I ordered the crispy honey shrimp and the signature Lo mein to share and both were disappointing and expensive for what it is. Panda Express is wayyy better. Our server was very nice, but took a while to get what we asked for. You can get parking validated! Don't think I'll ever be back to any location though LOL",92802
2471,"321 W Katella Ave Ste 120 Anaheim, CA 92802",Kevin B.,"Anaheim, CA",5/10/2020,1,"Prologue: I am a hotelier / Food & Beverage manager with 20+ years experience working around the world, my wife, as well. I say this so that you understand that I have seen days when things go wrong in hospitality, when things go VERY badly, and when things are worse than ""in the weeds"". There is ALWAYS a way to take care of customers - I know, because I got paid to do this, for over twenty years.Spoiler alert: BLACKBALLAt 11:59am I placed an order to pick up at 530pm from the P.F. Chang's on 321 Katella Ave. in Anaheim. Please read this again - I called FIVE AND A HALF HOURS AHEAD of my desired pick up time.My confirmed order at 11:59am was #594704121.There was no mention of anticipated delays, whether due to Mother's Day, it being Sunday, just because of staff call-outs, etc.I arrived at 5:20pm to wait in line (I expected this), and it was long, with some visibly unhappy people standing in it. Rather than run up to the take-out counter and see catching aggro from hangry people, I waited until I got just within the doorframe to ask about my order.I overheard a maskless PFC employee tell most of the crowd that, due to unspecified reasons, ALL ordered were delayed, and that they were about 2 hours behind schedule. He urged guests to try to cancel pending orders, even ones that had already paid in advance.No apologies. No options. Not really concerned.As I said up front, I have seen staff walk outs, had 300% of reservations show up on a holiday and EXPECT to be served, had a death on property and a wedding occurring at the same time, and there was / is ALWAYS a way to deal with all customers to make them feel valued. This never happened with PFC-Anaheim. I am glad their names were in the window - Elizabeth Kosonoy (Operating Partner) and Exec. Chef Jimmy Piñeda, SHAME ON YOU BOTH. You knew when you walked in what the day was going to be like, and you did N.O.T.H.I.N.G. to manage it. You hid yourselves, let your staff do the talking while you turned business away, rather than try to salvage what was supposedly a festive meal for mothers and their doting children. They, like my family, WANTED to spend this meal with P. F. Chang's on the menu, the centerpiece of the festivities, and you not only didn't deliver - you turned us away.You had 5.5 hours in my case to call me an tell me earlier that I had a choice to make - instead, you put a fire which will follow you forever on Yelp, and every time I retell this story. If you have two ears and ask what's good to eat in Anaheim (and what's not), you'll hear from me.BLACKBALL: (verb and noun) When you detest service or an experience you received so much that you can't just rate it a zero, can't just post about it, but you make the conscious decision to NEVER return to the offending location ever again, even if you're hungry...even if it's late, and the site is the only one open, that level of refusal is called ""blackballing"". There are a few places my family and I have had to BLACKBALL, for reasons like this, so to say PF Chang's- Anaheim is in this esteemed company of failures speaks for itself.I have worked with former PFC store managers, corporate trainers and the like and I have found them to be hard working, innovative and caring about their customers. Those other locations are out there - find them. Anaheim is a wasteland, and our local Thai place (Lanta Thai in Orange, also on Katella) saved our family meal. Looks like Chang's doesn't have a lock on festive Asian food. You have choices, peeps - vote with your feet and your wallets, and let PF Chang's - Anaheim know of your disapproval.",92802

At 5:45pm we received a cancellation notice by email from P.F. Chang's. No call from P.F. Chang's. Tried to call, but not able to get through. Now we are left with no Mother's Day dinner. This is cramp even for pandemic times. Thank you P.F. Chang's for ruining Mother's Day and losing a customer for life. Heaven will melt before I ever use this restaurant again.Part 2 to the story. Even though PF Chang's made the driver wait 2 1/2 hours for food they never prepared and than canceled our order by email, without a phone call, leaving us to scramble to get dinner somewhere else.

Being a Saturday the restaurant wasn't that busy. Let me rewind my day a little. So before coming here, I was at BJ's drinking and my friend who is getting married called me up and told me that she wants to eat at PF chang's. So I drove from Block at Orange to this location. It was 3 of us , we check in and the wait time was 10 mins. I have visited this location enough, the normal wait time for this location on weekend is at least 45 mins.So I was happy that we will enjoy our food and have a good time. So we got seated, as soon as we sit I told the server its my friend's wedding soon and we specially came here today for her. So he acknowledged it and said he will take care of us. For starters we ordered , beer and Hot and Sour Soup. It took him really long to get the Soup. The Soup arrives which was cold and the server gives us plastic disposable spoons, with absolute no explanation. He left as if everything was normal. I was like is this really happening. So I called him and asked why are we given disposable spoons in sit down. The weirdest explanation I ever heard, he said "" we don't have any clean soup spoons right now, which is why the disposable spoons"". This big restaurant didn't have 3 spoons for us. I don't believe it. I told him , I cant drink off disposable spoons, he said he will try and then get 1 spoon saying"" I very toughly managed to get 1 spoon"", as if he went on a war to get a spoon.Then we ordered the main food which arrived , again this was cold as well. It had been 1 hour into the place and he still didn't give us napkins which has knife and spoons to eat. We had to ask him to get it for us , which he again took time. So the already cold food was just sitting there since we had no spoons to eat off. The person wasn't sorry a bit or gave a apology for the disposable spoons, cold food and the napkins and spoons.Wasted my money. I only tipped around $5.56 to make is $100 , I was not going to tip at all. But I didn't wanted any bad karma. We hardly ate anything at the restaurant, since everything was cold. When I reheated the food and ate it, obviously it didn't have the same charm. Obviously I have been here a lot, that too in a crowded time , but always was served hot food and best service.

Everything seemed to go wrong with their take-out. I arrived at the stated time to pick up my order and was promptly told there were one or two items left to be completed and my order would be out shortly. 30 minutes later, I was still waiting for my food. The real disaster however, was when I got home to serve my family their meal. Everything was cold (as if it had been sitting for over 30 minutes) and from there it got worse. The hot and sour soup was neither hot nor sour. Clearly something went missing when they made the soup. The portion sizes for all the entrées appeared to be half of their normal size and when we were done - everyone was still hungry -definitely not our normal Chang's experience. Huge cartons with very tiny portions inside. Needless to say their quality and portion control Was lacking - or was it? That's always the first sign of trouble with a restaurant and I hope cOVID-19 is not killing one of my favorites. Sadly, I can only give one star for this visit because it truly sucked.

He waited 30 minutes for his food only to find out they made it right the first time. The server re-did his entree for no reason.

After a long day at the park we wanted a nice dinner to enjoy.   We chose P.F. Chang's in Anaheim which is very close to the park.   We had many choices around us but wanted something we could all enjoy.   We called in ahead of time to make reservations or to put down our names but they wouldn't do that so we just showed up.  The wait time was 45 minutes so we waited.  It took an hour then we had to sit outside but they said they had heaters.   When we seated I asked the hostess if they could turn on the heater please?  Sure I'll have them turn it on for you, she said.  No heater turned on until another 38 minutes and the 3rd person we asked finally did it with an excuse that it was probably turned on but it's broken,  it wasn't and we finally got warmed up.  We never ate at the PF Chang's in Anaheim yesterday 10/18/2019 only waited 2.5 hours finally was told it would be another 1/2 hour as they were very busy.  The children were falling asleep so we asked to talk to the manager and he finally came out but not to talk to us he was chatting with a couple at another table so my husband got up to talk to him asked for the bill for the drinks, water, tea, lemonade, apple juice , coke, mojito and one bourbon, and the manager said no worries so we left.  We missed out going back to Disneyland as we had to find another place to eat.   Worst service We've ever experienced in our whole life!    Pick another restaurant for sure!",92802

2508,"321 W Katella Ave Ste 120 Anaheim, CA 92802",Paul T.,"Santa Ana, CA",6/27/2018,3,"There are two things I can recommend at PF Chang's: the Chicken Lettuce Wraps (which according to their fortune cookies, they claim to have practically invented) and the Oolong Chilean Sea Bass.   I wouldn't be surprised if their Chilean Sea Bass is not ordered very often because it's the most expensive item on the menu at $28, and it's not one the stereotypical Chinese dishes that one thinks of when you eat Chinese.  It's a shame however because on the several times that we've ordered it, the Chilean Sea Bass portion was large, and the fish was nicely cooked, flaking apart with a fork.  At most places that serve Chilean Sea Bass, it typically costs $40+; so it's actually a bargain at $28 at PF Chang's.   Other dishes that we've tried were a bit mediocre (Ginger Chicken with Broccoli and Chang's Spicy Chicken).  Nobody has ever said ""I adore Chinese food!  Let's go to PF Chang's!"" (Actually, probably many people have said that and deserved a laugh.)  Obviously, it is not authentic Chinese food but there's a market for this food with nice décor, friendly service and reasonable prices.Happy Hour here offers great deals on both drinks and several popular appetizers including the Chicken Lettuce Wraps at about  1/2 price.Interesting Fact:  PF Chang's was cofounded by Paul Fleming (hence ""P.F.""), who also started Fleming's Steakhouse, Pei Wei, and Paul Martin's American Grill.",92802

Not my cup of tea but the noodles looked like cute little worms that were fun to eat. My surf and turf was good and was enough for 2 ppl. The dish seemed disjointed as if you put 2 dishes on you plate at a buffet. It had salt and pepper fried shrimp and lobster on one side and a stir fry of filet mignon, potatoes and asparagus on the other side. Both the tasted great and had plenty of flavor.

It was a bowl full of crispy noodles with heavy veggies and no chicken. The Mongolian beef was burned and tasted like coal. The server was missing and never refilled our drinks or checked on us. Our plates piled up in front of us over a course of a two hour meal, and we had to sing happy birthday to my dad with a pile of dirty plates around him. I couldn't capture a nice family picture because our table looked disgusting. Finally their card system was down so the manager made photocopies of my cards and said he would bill them later.

For being Americanized Chinese food, they deliver on a good customer experience while integrating the latest technologies that are ultimately customer centric.Keep in mind, though, if you are coming here, you are likely going to park in a parking structure that only gives you one hour free. For what it's worth, PF Chang's here will validate for an additional hour, so you basically can get 2 hours out of parking in that structure. I recommend parking on the second floor as that will get you as close to the restaurant as possible unless you like to walk.I typically order the chili garlic string beans, a few boozy drinks, two proteins (one land one sea) and steamed white rice on the side. These are all good, though, if you're not a fan of garlic, you may want to pass on the chili garlic string beans especially if your gastro-system is particularly sensitive.It is on the pricier side, if you want cheap Chinese food, don't come to PF Chang's. But if you're looking for a more upper scale Chinese place while still retaining some sense of being casual, come here.There is a full bar and my god there is a plethora of hard booze on the wall.There is free WiFi here.Come hungry.",92802

The salt content was over the top as well! I guess they're trying to make up for the lack of flavour with extra heavy salt!! I didn't complain.

We often get Theron and on Christmas Eve he truly made our night spectacular with his warm sweet disposition, which is constant with him . Tonight Earwin anticipated our every need, was so zen , and without us even asking moved our table away from a large table of very loud inconsiderate women. If you're coming to P.F.

Food and service was actually pretty good, but I could not give four stars due to the inconvenience of not having a designated pick up spot. Food:Lettuce wraps with chicken - Plenty of lettuce and filling for two people. Definitely could be a meal and not just an app. 4 stars. Spicy tuna roll - a bit pricy ($11?) for the quantity, but tasted ok. Have had better at legit sushi places. 3.5 stars. Side order fried rice - blah is all I can say and mushy too - 1 StarSide order Brussels sprouts - very tasty but I usually expect them to be crispier. Likely due to take out and steam within containers. Do what most Chinese restaurants already know, let the steam release out of container - 2 starsService - my call was answered promptly and they even remembered to include extra siracha sauce. So many places forget the condiments. I also left my CC behind and they kept it for me - 4 stars. Could have been 5 if they called me back about CC and they didn't forget extra wasabi. Convenience - parking in the structure is free for first hour, so not bad if you have time and want to walk over and get your food. Not really convenient for take out like other places who designate spots and even come to your car - 2 stars. Could have been higher if they walked me through what I needed to do once I got there.",92802

We were understanding about the delay, as that is expected, but to cancel our entire order with no explanation?! What kind of customer service is this?? A place called Tan's was way more professional and took our order LAST MINUTE and is going to have it ready within the hour.

Just plain bad service.  Needles to say it was a terrible experience.  The eorst for this place.   The servers are bad here.  Well if you want a real review there it is.  If your looking for a good dinner go elsewhere where you will get service and not wait over an hour to get your dinner.   1 star for the service.   We pay the prices listed we expect service for our hard earned dollar.    And they want a tip???!!!   Here's one.  ""Don't plant corn in the snow"".  That's my tip tonight!!!  Maybe next time they will provide adequate service for what is expected here.  The kicker our fortune cookie said you will have much to be thankful for    We're thankful to get out of this placeUpdate.  We went back into this location and decided to sit at the bar area.  We were met right away and the drinks were right out our order went right in and the food was out quick.  The service was better at the bar from our last visit.   The food was really good.   We only wish the server would have checked in a bit more to make sure we had our drinks filled.   Other than that this visit was better than the last.  This is why I have updated my review.   I feel they can improve the customer service and they will be a 5 star location.",92802

Tonight was probably the best experience we have had at any of them! We made a reservation for 9:30, arrived at 9 and they seated us after a short wait early, even though they were very busy. I expected it to be slower service since they were busy and I did read the reviews before going here tonight, but boy was I wrong!I believe our waiter was named Marco but he had glasses and was wearing Levi's tonight. Right when we sat down he took our drink order and a very short time later took the rest of the order. Shrimp dumplings, crab cream cheese won tons, veggie lettuce cups, wonton soup, veggie fried rice and lo mein, mongolian beef and on accident honey chicken instead of shrimp. Most of my family is Pescatarian and won't eat meat except seafood. After all the appetizers we were getting full. When the main courses came out I realized the mistake that I had said honey chicken instead of shrimp.   Since we were all full anyways everyone was cool with not re-ordering it, but our waiter insisted on ordering one for us. When it came out it was so good and since we felt bad about it we all gorged ourselves on it. But aside from this above and beyond action the food was excellent. If you are on yelp reading reviews I would say to give them a try and if you have the same great experience I did, leave them a nice review! These days people will complain about the smallest things, but this is proof that if you have an issue and communicate it in any way, they will take care of you!!

I'm not. You're in business and you better care - A LOT - about your customers experience. But I don't write a lot of critical reviews because I usually do my homework and am very careful about the places I choose to visit. Last night was an exception. I normally check out places but last night because of the situation I didn't have time. I also don't normally go to corporate chain restaurants. Last night I did. Bad decision on my part. I'll own that. Let me say up front - The food was fine and what you expect from a chain, even a little better. Predictably good AND predictably not amazing. And our server was great and did the best he could with a bad situation. This review is about MANAGEMENT. Simply put, somebody was asleep at the wheel last night. Whoever was in charge of reservations and running the room did a terrible job. I'm not saying he/she is a terrible PERSON. But I am saying a poor job was done and the system appears broken. We arrived early for our reservations and were told it would be a short wait while our table paid the bill and finished up. 45 minutes later no table. And as I sat there I saw that a number of other people were given disappointing reports about the state of their ""reservation"".  They say misery loves company but I can tell you there was nothing to love about it. But I did realize the problem was bigger than just us. So they eventually called our name and walked us into the dining area and tried to see if we would be willing to squeeze three people into a two top. Not gonna happen. So we stood there - not going back to the holding area and not accepting the two top. I knew whoever moved first was going to lose. I looked around and saw several open tables. Our host excused himself went back to talk to someone and then - magically - we were allowed to sit at an appropriate sized table. So we sat and our server quickly appeared and immediately set the stage for further disappointment by announcing that the bar was severely backed up and said that we could order drinks but it would likely take a good while. And it did. A long while. Again - it's not the servers fault. It's management. There's a convention in town with 20,000 attendees and this place is very close to that mass of humanity. It seems to me that Someone in the office needs to plan a little better and pay attention to the schedule at the convention center and staff accordingly. A lot of what happened last night could have been minimized. Maybe it was just a bad night. Maybe the computer blew up. Idk. But it wasn't good. Hopefully they're on top of it. If not - it's gonna be a rough ride.",92802

I told the person I spoke with that I could pick up the dressing and sauces and was willing to pay extra for someone to drop them off. She said that she did not have anyone available. She sensed that I was not happy and offered to give me a refund of $25 gift card via email. She took my email address, address, and phone number and said that I will get an email of the gift card credit. I have not receive any email of the gift card!",92802

2545,"321 W Katella Ave Ste 120 Anaheim, CA 92802",John M.,"Cardiff, CA",3/19/2018,2,"We were attending a convention at the Anaheim Convention Center and made a 7:30pm reservation at P.F. Chang's at Garden Walk.  It's a P.F. Chang's so you pretty much know what you're going to get food-wise, and overall we were not disappointed in that regard.  And, our server was quite good.However, I want to highlight some of the difficulties with the front desk that need to be addressed:- We had a 7:30pm reservation for 4 people.- At 7:20pm, we realized that we were running a little late and I called the restaurant to notify them that we would be 10 minutes late.  We were told that they would hold our table.- As expected, we arrived 10 minutes past our reservation and at that time we were told to wait for a table to become available.  - For a little while, we watched people get seated who had been waiting without reservations.- After about 10 minutes of waiting (now 20 minutes past our reservation), we mentioned to one of the front desk staff that we were waiting for a 7:30pm reservation, but they didn't do anything.  - After about 10 more minutes, we asked someone else why we hadn't been seated when we had a 7:30pm reservation, and then they seated us.Our question, is this really how a reservation system is supposed to work?  If you make a reservation, doesn't that mean that your table is reserved so that you don't have to wait?Bottom line: This inefficiency sure makes me question whether I'll want to go back to P.F. Chang's next time I'm in the area.",92802

The main food dishes were super yummy and well worth the wait.  I was not too impressed with the appetizers. Overall the evening ended well but I'm not to sure I'd return to this location.",92802

Before checking in to our hotel we decided to do a to go order. After picking the food up and going to our room I find out 2 items were missing from my order. So I called the restaurant and ""Jesus"" I believe his name was the manager said come back and he would give me my items. (Which was missing rice) when I got there he had the items ready and apologized. He then gave me a little something extra for my time and having to come back it was a surprise and not expected at all but made me happy. the portions of chicken seemed small for there price. The following day we returned to the restaurant to give it one more try. It went well food was good our server Carlo did a good job. (The coconut pineapple ice creamIs very good)",92802

2553,"321 W Katella Ave Ste 120 Anaheim, CA 92802",Dave O.,"New Smyrna Beach, FL",9/26/2015,5,"I am always glad to see a P.F. Chang's restaurant anywhere close to where I'm staying when traveling for business or pleasure. I can't count the number of reviews I've read regarding this restaurant chain over the years and they always seem to be all over the place. Fortunately I've never had a negative experience at any of their locations and I consider myself a pretty tough customer for the most part especially when it comes to extremely long waits whether its for a table or for the food and I have very little sympathy when the service is bad or inattentive. So I guess I'm pretty luck to be batting a .1000 when it comes to great experiences at any of the P.F. Chang's locations I've visited. This location was only a short walk from the hotel, we arrived a little after 7:30 PM and we were able to be seated immediately. I really need to put more effort in remembering the servers names because fortunately on this night we had exceptional service. She arrived at out table and greeted us with a giant smile and a very inviting personality I know some could careless about this and it's always expected, but to me this sets the tone and it's always good to meet someone who loves their job, the company they work for. I think she told us she has been at this location about seven years and her intimate knowledge of the menu and customer service skills made it clear she has been successful. After taking our drink orders and making a few recommendations she left us so we could explore the many options offered here. This is never a difficult choice for us because the food is always so consistence. I recently started exploring gluten free options and I was happy to see a nice array offered for dinner.  Lettuce Wraps - Always a safe and delicious choice, the minced chicken mixture was plentiful and filled with an abundance of flavors and textures. The lettuce leafs were cold, crispy and held together when filled and rolled. This is absolutely one of our favorite dishes. Gluten Free Broccoli and Beef - I ordered this extra spicy, it came out hot with plenty of lean beef mixed with very nicely cut sautéed broccoli tossed in a brown sauce that was filled with spice but not overly spicy. When our server returned with a set of fresh drinks she also had the kitchen prepare a bowl of hot chili oil just in case I wanted a little more heat, which I gladly accepted. Another enjoyable dinner and dining experience at another P.F. Chang's Restaurant and hopefully another great table for our server.",92802

Sat down ordered our appetizer and or food got our appetizer within 10 minutes. We finished our appetizer and waited about 35 minutes for our food, mind you we only ordered 1 dish and it came cold. Not pleased with this location at all. I would say maybe the server was good but could have been a lot more attentive to our table. Wouldn't recommend this location.",92802
2555,"321 W Katella Ave Ste 120 Anaheim, CA 92802",Angel B.,"Anaheim, CA",8/15/2015,3,"Yelp challenge 2015  160 /365A few years ago this place was real tastey. Not sure what happened. Made reservations online, which was super easy and convenient. Arrived on time and seated right away.What I love about this place is the Ambience. At night, its dim, tables are comfortable and the setting is nice. Dishes are presented nicely and plates are just big enough to get the right amount of food. We had a huge red card on our table indicating our occasion. It took a few minutes to meet our server, at least 5 or so minutes. Finally he arrived.  He must of not noticed the red card, because he never looked at it or aknowledged anything. Unless, he did say something, and I didnt hear him. When we left I asked the front what the cards are for, if the waiter doesn't aknowledge anything. The manager apologized for our server and said he should of at least given us a special desert.Our server, disappeared a lot. The station he was working was not even that busy. Most of his tables had people sitting at different times, so it is not like he was running around because everyones orders were coming out at once. I saw other waiters in other sections that were very busy who were very attentive. Very attentive, busting their tails. As for our table, we really didn't have any service. Our waiter did however tend to the table of 3 generations ; pretty teen, mom and grandma next to us. Perhaps he just wanted to give us privacy. The couple next to us looked neglected too. But the family before the couple, seemed to have excellent service. We ordered an appetizer to start as we were still going over the menu. We ordered the dumplings. When we ordered our meal no more than 5 minutes later, we ordered the Prefix meal and an additional dish because we love to eat. The meal came with 2 soups, an appetizer, 2 main dishes and desert for about $45. He wouldn't let us use the dumplings appetizer we ordered 5 minutes before, because he put on for 6, not 4 and couldn't change it, or didn't want to change it. So we had to order an additional appetizer. Makes no sense. Especially when those dumplings came out AFTER we ordered the second appetizer and minutes before our meal. Which tells me he forgot them in the kitchen.  I am sure it is easy to change something like that, especially dumplings which is probally ordered frequently. So we ordered the cream cheese wontons too, which came out first.Onto our meal. Our hot and sour soup, was just like the name. Hot and sour. Pretty tastey in a thick rich broth and lots of tufu.  The rice was dry. For a place that serves rice all day you think they get it right. Im not a huge rice eater to begin with. But the hubsters is. For the first time, he didnt finish his rice, or take it with him.The honey crispy chicken had very little flavor and was overcooked and very starchy. Not as good as I remembered it. The thai noodles seemed like it was missing something, and are not your typical Thai noodles you may be used to. The Orange chicken was my favorite out of the 3 dishes, just not as crispy as I am used too. We were stuffed afterwards. When we were done, we still waited for our server to notice.We did a lot of waiting here. When customers are slowing down on their meal, a good waiter is on top of it and starts asking if they need anything else, any boxes, maybe some water, ect. I felt like we were doing a lot of waiting, while the waiter was elsewhere.When we left our waiter was up front, which explains why we never saw him. He was busy socializing with the hostess. We still tipped him cash close to 15% on our $75 bill, which was very generous. I hope he at least shared it.At the end, when we were leaving we voiced our concerns to the very sweet manager, who listened to us and apologized for our lack of service and experience. She was very generous and invited us back for dinner on them, with a giftcard which was unexpected. We already paid the bill and were not looking for anything else.  In the end, everything was resolved, which is why I am giving it an extra star. I will return to see if the next visit is any better. Which I am sure it will be.Maybe we just had an off night.Review 565",92802

I thoroughly believe that it is all stemming from what the people are using as their reference point. This is a chain so I'm not going to compare it to a restaurant in China Town or something like that but it is just your normal run of the mill chain restaurant. Nothing special, nothing terrible. I took my daughters to eat here after a long day at Disneyland, we sat down right away and our waiter was nice. We ordered spring rolls and pork pot stickers. They were ok. I got a side order of Long life noodles and I thought that it was pretty good.

I'm a relatively simple person (as long as you don't ask anyone who knows me) so I went with the chicken fried rice and hot and sour soup. The chicken fried rice was delicious, almost buttery. It's not like the fried rice you'd get in a Thai restaurant, but it's good in its own right. The hot and sour soup was good as well.

To my surprise PF Changs had quite a good selection of eats as well as drinks for happy hour.Happy Hour times are  3PM-7PM - Monday through Friday, 9PM-11PM - Monday through Thursday, 10PM-Midnight - FridayWe sat at the bar and service was ehhh at best. We had to ask for menus, and a few times to get our waters refilled. The bartender seemed preoccupied with his coworkers and frequently was in the bar corner joking with them and ignoring customers.To start we ordered a bottle of SAKE each and a variety to appetizers which included:      GEKKEIKAN SAKE JAR $5The sake came warm and in a cute little jar with cute cups. The jar poured about 3 full almost 4 shots. We ended up ordering 3 jars each. 4 STARS***  HAND-FOLDED CRAB WONTONS $4.00 (4 Per Order)Crispy wontons filled with crab, bell peppers and green onions, with spicy plum sauce. 4 STARS*** These were filled with the perfect amount of filling and fried to perfection. the sauce was sweet with a little spicy zing to it. CHANG'S CHICKEN LETTUCE WRAPS $6.00 Wok-seared chicken, mushrooms, green onions and water chestnuts served over crispy rice sticks with crisp lettuce cups 4STARS** I enjoyed this dish, chicken was seasoned great not too salty or bland, the lettuce was very fresh and overall very filling dish. We ran out of lettuce and had to ask for extra lettuce.  SALT AND PEPER CALAMARI $7.00Crispy strips tossed with Fresno peppers and green onions, with sweet chili dipping sauce. 3 STARS*** the calamari were tiny little strips that didn't real have too much flavor. and once you dipped the calamari, all you could taste was the chili dipping sauce   AHI TARTARE WITH AVOCADO $7.00Sushi-grade diced tuna with cucumbers, scallions and citrus soy sauce, on crispy wonton chips 4 STARS*** I enjoyed the ahi tartare. didn't care too much for the crispy wonton chips after a while, but the ahi tartare by itself was perfectly seasoned with just the right amount of cucumber and scallions. The quality of ahi was pretty good too, not the best i've had but certainly not the worse either.  SPICY TUNA ROLL $7.00Rolled-to-order sushi-grade Ahi with crisp cucumber, daikon sprouts and sesame-seasoned rice. 3 STARS*** basic spicy tuna rolls, nothing spectacular. Bathrooms are nice and clean. This location is large with plenty of tables to accommodate almost any size party. Parking is available in the structure.

The spare ribs were also gross this time with barely any flavor or texture.. oddly they tasted boiled which isnt what we remember. The beef sichuan had weirdly textured beef almost like jerky which we didnt like or expect (should have said something on menu). The best parts of the meal were the cheesecake and shrimp with lobster sauce or maybe the fortune cookies if they had bothered to give us any with our take out order (ugh).

There were several big parties that night, and we were seated near the kitchen so it was a little noisy. I ordered the chicken lettuce wraps, my mom a small side of the fried rice (which didn't seem like it was going to be enough for her), and my dad the Mongolian beef. It took a little while to get our order, and another table got their order before ours (even though we had ordered before them).

Chang's, but I did go in with low expectations because most of my friends find their food to be overpriced Americanized Asian fusion food. I think going in with low expectations worked in my favor because I was pleasantly surprised. First of all, they have an awesome kids menu! Everything on the kids menu is $5 or less and it includes so much food for them! I loved it!My husband and I shared the vegetarian curry and honey walnut shrimp entrees. The portions are extremely generous and the vast majority of entree items are under $20. We very much enjoyed the honey walnut shrimp and I liked the little melon balls included with it. While definitely not authentic Chinese, it was still delicious. The vegetarian curry dish was more disappointing. While the curry itself was flavorful, the vegetables they put in it was way too Americanized. They put huge chunks of almost raw carrots and cherry tomatoes for goodness sake! Why not add some snap peas or edamame? And instead of American broccoli, do some Chinese broccoli/bok choy! Needless to say, I picked out all the carrots and cherry tomatoes because it tasted gross with the curry flavor. That was definitely the biggest disappointment.I finished it with a nice pot of green tea which was perfect. Would I come back? Only if I had a gift card.",92802

It's in a shopping area, so parking is in the structure. The pick up wasn't ready by the time it said it was. The brown rice was given to a different order that had a large party dinning in the restaurant  so I was going to have to wait until the rice was ready. I said just give me the white rice because that was done. They pissed me off and once I said give me the white rice that took another 5 minutes to bring that out. The girl behind the counter was fine it was nothing she could do because of course she's just helping people with online orders. I won't come back to this restaurant and I live less than five minutes away I'll spend my money where I am appreciated. Yeah I didn't leave a tip either.",92802

First of all, let me acknowledge that the service and food was good. What happened was that no one let me know that their ""servers were down"" and they can't accept gift cards. I literally asked a worker before we sat down if they accepted our business gift cards, which they gladly said yes. At the end of the meal, our server said the servers were down and they can't take my gift cards. Asked for manager and was told he isn't here and that this is corporate policy so their hands are tied. Excuse me? Corporate was the one selling bulk gift cards to our company.  I was embarrassed but mostly mad as I we spent money on gift cards and now had to pay for our meal. I would have at least been ok if they took 10% off or offered a free drink/dessert. When asked if the servers would be up soon, they replied with ""it was supposed to work today, you can ask corporate."" No thank you, we will never come back and neither will any employees.

Most of the food near Disney isn't the best since restaurants are usually jam packed, and this location rang true to that. It was the worst quality of P.F. Chang's that I have had. Very disappointed. Spend over $60 and it was not worth that. I got the usual appetizer: crispy green beans.Family style meal: spicy chicken, sesame chicken, brown rice.Won't be back.",92802

Went in on a late Sunday afternoon, the host girl told us to expect 25 to 30 minutes wait since we asked for a booth. Headed straight to the bar, surprisingly our booth was ready even before we received our drinks, that was fast! It was a very comfy and intimate seating, had a good view of the entire beautiful restaurant and patio, nice! How I have missed the extensive Asian fusion menu, so appetizing just looking at the items! Lots of seafood and vegetarian choices. Our delicious food:Spicy tuna roll: the spicy tuna and rice were fairly proportioned, the flavor was so good, very spicy, loved it! Hunan style Alaskan cod with veggies: the fish slices were so tender inside, nice crispy texture outside, the sauce was extremely flavorful, so delicious! Kung pao scallops: spicy and salty, scallops were very fresh and tender, the Kung pao flavor was amazing! I rarely get to eat anything in Kung pao flavor because it is chicken usually. Garlic egg noodles, with minced cucumber: the textures of the noodles were so good, the garlic and spicy flavors were just so yummy!Wonton soup, with wontons, shrimps, chicken and veggies: the soup was light with enough flavors, loved the shrimps and veggies in there! Desert:Banana egg rolls with coconut ice cream and fresh strawberries: hubby and I loved the coconut ice cream, the banana egg rolls were delicious, not too sweet, just right for me! Drinks:Organic Agave margarita, Yuzu Mojito, Kirin light: the Mojito was a little bit too sweet, but the margarita was so good. Our server was very friendly and attentive, I was very happy with his service! We really should frequent this location more often, it's a beautiful restaurant with great comfort food and service, I just LOVE it! Ps. Remember to validate parking ticket!",92802

Chang's isn't a place I normally go to, but I was craving something sweet and I was with my group of people so it was set in stone that we would go!We came in for a walk in and they accepted our name and we had only waited 10-15 minutes. By the way the host was very sweet and welcoming. We sat on a nice table in the center of the restaurant and eager to order some food. Our nice waiter came up took our drink order and gave us a few more moments to look at our menu. She came back with our drinks and took our order. Now this is where the reasoning of the two stars begins.We were pretty hungry as soon as we sat down and had waited 45min-1 hour for our food to come out. The server didn't give us an update because she was busy with the other tables as well.Our food runner came, we all were relieved and excited to eat. We ordered half brown rice half white rice, fried rice, sweet sour chicken, broccoli beef, Mongolian beef and Orange peel chicken.But instead we received, one bowl of rice, hot fresh fried rice and cold lukewarm dishes that were dis portioned. The sad dishes were under a heat lamp for quite a while or out for too long as they looked a bit dry except for the hot sweet and sour chicken, but even that had cold veggies. The beef broccoli was literally a plate full of broccoli and 5-7 pieces of beef scattered along the random sized florets. Now I'm only complaining because this is a pricey place that has been in business for a long time and it should live up to everyone expectations instead of a fast food joint. We had let our server know the situation and she immediately took action to make amends. She was wonderful and helpful. She went to the manager and got us Togo meals to replace our room temp meals that we finished(we were starving and couldn't wait at that point)At the end we paid for our meal and I had asked the server if they were short staffed and she said no. Hopefully the back kitchen will get it together because when they remade our meals it was still white rice no brown rice and instead of Mongolian beef it was Honey chicken.Great front of house +Lost back of house -",92802

We were not in a hurry so it was ok. When our food finally came the lettuce wraps were spot on. My sweet and sour chicken was Luke warm at best. The problem was there was no rice. I was almost done before he finally brought it. BUT it was in a bowl that had dried food of some kind caked on the outside of. Wasn't really sure how clean the inside of the bowl was so we asked for another bowl. 5 minutes later it showed up, very warm, problem was my entree was finished.  He asked me if I wanted more water and I told him yes.

Finally a hostess swept it and it still looked disgusting. Several tables unbussed the entire time we are here. Very gross!The place was NOT busy, maybe 8-10 tables in entire restaurant and young manager was just standing at the bar talking to a small group of employees. Not work related as they were laughing, etc.This is the second below average experience we've had and I don't know why we keep coming back.Server was 4 stars but everything else was a 1 that's how I came to a 2.Cooperate if you read this or care please step it up.

2603,"321 W Katella Ave Ste 120 Anaheim, CA 92802",Andrea M.,"Rosamond, CA",2/11/2020,3,"PF Changs is one of my favorite places to eat.  There is not one in my home town and the closest is 1.5 hours, so I mostly get to enjoy it on vacations.  I ordered takeout.  The take out experience went really well.  Easy to order online, fast and friendly when I got there to pick up my order.  They sent me to the register area and I was in and out in a couple minutes.  Overall the food is good, but a couple things I did not like.  The Mongolian Beef had huge chunks of meat.  I like mine a little thinner, but others may like the chunks.  I had asked for extra sauce it had no extra sauce, so good think I asked for extra or it may have been dry, or maybe they just ignored my request.  However, it was flavorful, could have used more onions, but that's probably just me, I love onions. My rice was good and a little sticky which makes it perfect to eat with the beef.  The lettuce wraps are so good I could eat them everyday.  I love the flavors, the chicken with the vegetables, and I add the rice noodles for a little crunch.  Now what happened to the huge, beautiful lettuce cups?  Mine was more like lettuce from the $.99 store.   However, they did offer extra lettuce at no cost, which I liked because I just like a little meat mixture with mostly lettuce, kind of like a lettuce wrap salad.  Here is my big complaint; (I know it's been gone for a while) but where is the old sauce?  The sauce they created at your table and asked how spicy you wanted it.  Now they come with 2 sauces and neither even remotely compared with the old sauce! One had a wasabi flavor and I hated it, the other was ok, but no where near the old sauce.  Overall good experience.  Would go back.  Good location if you are staying near Disneyland.",92802

Chang's, but since it was a chain I always somewhat discounted them. However, I was hungry, it was late, and a bit of Asian food sounded good at the time, so why not.I was pleasantly surprised. The wait for a seat was probably going to be fifteen to twenty minutes, but the bar was pretty much clear, so that is what I went for. Too bad they didn't have any ciders available. I guess ciders are not all that popular in California yet... oh well, they will catch up eventually.For an appetizer I had the Hunan Dragon Wings, which are new and quite tasty. The wings are plump and have a good kick to them, but not so hot that they are impossible to eat. Well, at least not for me. I am probably a horrible person to rate the spiciness of things, since I consider jalapeno peppers to be mild.Next I had the Shrimp Tempura Roll, which wasn't even on the menu yet, but apparently is now on the on-line menu. Also quite good, but I have also had better sushi. Still, the tempura crunch you get from something like this is always nice.Finally, for my main entree I had the chicken pad thai. I don't usually get this dish anywhere, so it was a pleasant change. I wasn't able to finish everything, so I had them box it up and I took it back to the hotel.

In fact, they kept prioritizing the larger groups over the smaller ones, so you end up with more small groups upset with the service because the kitchen is overrun with large group orders. This is my third time at this particular location, and all three times, I have seen this happen. However, the service this particular visit was excellent. One server really did a fantastic job: Theron. We had waited for quite a while, and by the time we sat down, we were pretty hungry. Theron was extremely attentive to anything we needed. And as someone who worked in the restaurant industry on a managerial-level, Theron handled his section with an insane amount of efficiency, speed, and personality. Not once did we have to ask him for anything. He was 3-steps ahead of any ask and had a great sense of humor. If I could rate just Theron, he would easily earn 5-stars. But rating the restaurant as a whole and taking the incredibly inefficient reservation system into account, 3-stars is about right.We will be back- and hopefully, Theron will be working when we request his section.",92802

Changs that I really like.  I typically get the garlic noodles which are bursting in flavor and have a bit of spicy kick to them but the pepper steak is also an excellent dish I have tried.  Unfortunately it seems that many locations have not too recently modified their menus so not all items are available at all locations.  This location at the Anaheim Gardenwalk gets very busy for dinner so I recommend making reservations when time permits you to do so as the wait often rises over an hour.  I have never had a bad experience at this location.  The food is always hot and fast, the servers are friendly, the pricing is affordable and the restaurant is always immaculately clean.  They have loads of seating inside as well as a nice heated patio area.  This may be the best bang for your buck if you are looking for a semi fancy sit down Chinese restaurant at affordable pricing in the area.  I am craving this already and look forward to returning soon.",92802

The Wait: My boyfriend and I came here on a Sunday night for dinner. The hostess said the wait would be around 25 minutes and got our number to text us when our table would be ready. After about 40 minutes of walking around the plaza, we were getting impatient and still didn't get a text so we asked the hostess how much longer. She looked at her screen, gave a surprised look and said, ""OH! We can seat you now."" The Service: We already picked out what we wanted on the menu when we waited outside, so we were ready to order ASAP. Absolutely NO ONE came to us for 15 minutes (we literally timed it out of boredom of waiting) to take our order, not even to bring us water. Eventually, a young waiter came running to us and apologizing, it was pretty clear he forgot about us. The Food: Food. Was. Bleh. I don't want to be too harsh, but I could honestly get Panda Express and have it taste better than the chicken and beef dish we ordered, and for a WAY cheaper price too. We were starving at this point, and we didn't even finish our food. That's how you know how bad it was. Bill Complications: We ordered a SIDE of fried rice. They charged us for a main dish of fried rice, which was way more expensive. We asked our waiter, and he said that the dish he brought for us was the main dish, even though we ordered the side while physically pointing to it on the menu. He said he would change it on the bill, the manager came to address another complication with a coupon code they made a mistake on too, then eventually brought the bill out again and didn't change the price for the fried rice. This whole ordeal took up the majority of our time at the restaurant. My night ended with my boyfriend continuously apologizing to me for picking this place to eat. But for a successful chain, I expect the level of quality in food and customer service to be at least satisfactory, and it just wasn't.",92802

We had reservations last night (Friday) for a bigger party. They were extremely busy which wasn't bad. However when I went to the restroom with my infant to do a diaper change the changing table in the restroom was broken. I also have a toddler so this was beyond frustrating. So I cleaned the space between the sinks to take care of it. Multiple women asked why I wasn't using the stall that had the changing table sign on the outside of it. Well my daughter at 6 weeks has a colostomy bag that had to much gas in it and I had to take care of it on the counter! It was not only uncomfortable for me but for others! However, I can't not release the air as I risk leakage and that creates a much bigger issue. For a restaurant this big full to max capacity I'd hope that they would have functioning necessities within their establishment for the paying guests. Also our pad Thai had noodles that were not cooked all the way through. We ordered 2 of this dish, minutes apart and both dishes had this issue. Very disappointed to say the least",92802

I know their portions are smaller than the average Chinese restaurant but even for their standards this was a little bit. The gluten free fried rice with steak came out and it was mushy and flavorless. We told our server and they redid the dish. It ruined our meal since we couldn't enjoy all the dishes together and had to wait. They brought out the remade dish and the first couple of bites were an improvement less mushy but still lacking in flavor. We were told that because it's gluten free the flavor would be milder but we only ever order off the gluten free menu and never have this issue. Idk if they had someone new making the food or somebody who just doesn't care but we walked away disappointed.,92802

I'm asian, so I was very wary of managing my expectations for this restaurant lol. All in all, a decent meal. The portions are pretty large! We took home 1/3 of our meal, and we both can eat LOL. The ambiance here is also intimate but lively, with the dim lighting and floor-to-ceiling glass panels.We opted for the prix fixe menu, which includes 2 soups (choice of hot n sour and egg drop), an appetizer, 2 entrees, and a shared dessert. We also ordered the garlic spinach, and crab wontons.I LOVED the crab wontons!!!! But seriously, it's pretty hard to mess that up. The worse something is for your health, the better it seems to taste! I also adored the chicken lettuce wraps... Could've eaten that for my whole meal! Refreshing, crisp, and seasoned well. Pretty authentic, like what you'd find in a legit Chinese restaurant. Our shared dessert was also yummy, creamy coconut ice cream and 2 banana egg rolls drenched in caramel. My sweet tooth is why I won't be summer bod ready.I actually had to add my water to the hot n sour soup since it was too thick and salty for my liking, and the egg drop wasn't bad - but I've had better. For our two entrees, we had garlic noodles and Mongolian beef. Garlic noodles don't even have a hint of garlic.. So you've been warned! It was good, but it's better off named ""just noodles with cucumber, no garlic"". The BF seemed to really enjoy the Mongolian beef, it was very well marinated and seasoned too!Not too shabby, PF Chang's!",92802

We waited around 30 minutes for these dishes. We were ignored! We spoke to one of the managers. He did nothing to apologize or help. Service continued to go downhill with nobody bussing our table. It was stacked with dirty dishes and unused wine glasses. We had to ask for it to be cleared off, but that did not happen. Finally at the end they brought out a birthday cake.... the wrong one!

I get it, my husband works graveyard, nights, and weekends and he doesn't want to go to work on a holiday either, our daughter works early mornings and weekends, I have worked weekends and holidays in the past so we really try to give the benefit of the doubt and understand that working on holidays suck. We met our daughters in Anaheim because it was the most convenient location. (We usually go to Irvine and ha e been to RanchoCucamonga several tomesI was really disappointed since we will be moving to Anaheim from Fountain Valley in June. We figured this would be our go to restaurant, but that will not be the case. We walked in and sat down. While waiting for our waiter, a server, who looked miserable, wiped off the table next to us right onto the floor. I thought she would at least put the rice and crumbs on a plate, but nope. So I looked at my daughter who said she was going to go get a broom and I just needed to watch. Well watch I did. Watch as she came back again and put new forks on the table, watched as another waitress walked by, looked at the mess on the floor, and continued to walk away. Watch for almost 10 minutes as everyone there looked at the mess and walked right over it. Finally our waiter came out with a broom and half way swept it up. I was floored. While we were eating the same waitress did the same thing at the table behind us. I can only imagine what the kitchen looks like. I ordered my favorite ginger chicken and it was complete flavorless. I would have probably let the waited know and maybe even had the plate exchanged for something else however our waiter disappeared and didn't come back until he brought us boxes and the bill. This is not what I expected from PF Chang's. I guess I'll have to make my way back to Irvine.",92802

It's no surprise why I'm a chunky monkey as my fatness can never say no to food. No such thing as diet since the first three letters spellout die ^_^I love PF Changs and even though it's not the most authentic, their Chinese food is really good! It's one of those places you either like it or you don't like.Menu:I swore I hadn't eaten for weeks so I decided to over order. Less is better does not apply when hungry or hangry (hungry-angry)Chicken lettuce wraps- Chicken nicely minced with the right amount of peanuts but just a little bit too salty for my taste. It was ok.Dynamite shrimp- Battered fried shrimp glazed with a sweet sauce with a hint of spice. One of my favorites.Pad Thai- Why did I order a Thai dish at a Chinese restaurant? That's like ordering an Italian dish at a Mexican restaurant. The noodles were dry and the sauce was bland. Kung pao- Stir fry dish served with cubed chicken, peanuts and red peppers in a dark spicy sauce. Chicken was very tender and sauce was just right. Honey seared chicken- Battered chicken with sweet honey sauce, it was oh so good!Service:First time server introduced himself he seemed a bit annoyed but by the time he took our orders he was in a much better mood. He was consistant in providing us with good service, on top of getting us refills, to go boxes and our check. Happy to see he turned his frown upside down.Tip:Happy Hour Monday-Friday3:00pm to 6:00pm with seating in the entire restaurant and not just the bar or patio area.Location:It's located at the Anaheim Gardenwalk, right across from Mcckormick & Schmicks and next door to the Cheesecake Factory.Overall experience:If you haven't been to PF Changs, your missing out.

She comes back with plates and two UNWRAPPED straws on a plain napkin. She takes said unwrapped straws with here BARE HANDS and inserts them herself by the top into our drinks.

My sis had a gift card to use so we went here for dinner last night.The wait time for a table wasn't too bad considering we got here right around a busy Sunday night. Our server for the night was Laynie. She was very sweet and helpful on recommending to us what dish to get between a few of our choices. We decided to get the calamari appetizer, lo mein with pork, shaking beef, kung pao chicken and honey glazed shrimp. We also opted for brown rice since they don't serve jasmine rice unfortunately.I ordered a strawberry cucumber lime drink and I must say it was quite refreshing and delicious. Definitely recommend although no free refills.We got our calamari first and it was served with a side of salt and pepper and this sour sauce which was good when combining them all together.Our food came out in a reasonable amount of time considering how packed the place was. I thought the quality of the food was pretty much like Panda Express and wasn't too impressed but it was just average. The shaking beef dish was SALTY however. I like my food salty but these people don't mess around with the salt. I felt that the broccoli and asparagus in the beef dish were soaking in a salt bath. The honey shrimp tasted the least saltiest out of all the food we had. The brown rice was kinda mushy so I didn't enjoy it as much.It was a good thing we used a gift card considering the prices here. For the portions we got and the prices were averaging $15 per dish it wasn't well worth it in the end.I must say again though our server Laynie was awesome. She did a really nice job.My other gripe with this place was the restrooms. The urinal in the men's room was like a mini hallway and there was urine all over the floor so I couldn't get too close to it without stepping in a puddle of piss. Very poor restroom management and there were paper towels all over the floor too.They say a restaurant with a not so clean restaurant has not so great food.

Quality and price OMG really might as well just go to Panda Express.  Panda Express orange chicken add some red chili for $8.95 gives you twice as much food and honestly quality as good at Panda Express.So here's the thing it's my birthday month they gave me a buy-one-get-one-free for my birthday.  The entree was $17.95 for they're pfchangs equivalent to like an orange chicken a little spicier.  The portion was thank goodness white meat but just one entree not enough for two people really to share like they used to in the olden days. Came with brown or white rice. We also got the other dish was ginger chicken. I asked the waiter does it have any flavor or is it kind of boring and just unbattered and he said oh no it's really good it's got ginger and garlic and the broccoli is steamed, chicken just not battered. It shows up and chicken was dry leather. Plenty of broccoli and basically no other flavor. We returned it for just another portion of basically the same pfchangs special chicken. So while we're waiting rather than getting the normal lettuce wraps which last time I wasn't impressed with. I asked waiter about egg rolls. He said pork or chicken.  Ordered pork. I almost shit my pants when they arrived they weren't even good. They were soggy they weren't crunchy. I didn't look at the menu for prices of the egg rolls. When the bill came,  $5.95 for 2 soggy ass egg rolls.  Really PF? Get your shit together.  That is a joke of an egg roll. It is apparent that this location depends upon tourism from Disneyland and people who like to spend too much money on subpar Chinese food.  Thank God I had gift cards from family.  Sorry folks.

Then 40 min later we were sat at a different type of table than requested. Then 2 of the 5 menus were sticky so the beguine started out pretty rough. I can say at least after 5 mins being seated another waitress came to take our drink order and appetizer order as our waitress was too busy and would help us out soon as we were told.The service did change over, however our new server seemed overly busy and 3 times had to be asked for refills which took a long time each time. The food took a really long time to come out and was warm but not hot. Then we saw a manager a younger thin male in a suit talking to another table and joking and laughing with them I even timed it for 16 minutes. And yet the place was so busy we couldn't get hot food? Seems there are some real needs of training and time management that could be addressed. I mean we did have a bill that exceeded a hundred dollars. It's not like we were at a drive thru, I expected much better. I believe PF CHANGS earned a FAIL this time. Which is sad to say because I'm usually a fan. :-(",92802

I asked if the bar had open seating and opted to sit there. The bar tender acknowledged me right away and I ordered a Sangria, BBQ Ribs appetizer, vegetable spring roles and the market side of fried rice. The Red Sangria tasted watered down. The fried rice and ribs were good. I only ate half of one the spring rolls. These are typically a favorite, but the taste was off. I then asked the bartender to order the chocolate cake to go. He put in the order in right away and cashed me out. Twenty minutes later, I was still waiting for desert to go.If I visit again, it would only be with a party.

The first time didn't really impress me, but we came to give it another shot. We weren't really hungry, we just came to try a little of everything. So, we order the dinner for two, Lettuce Cup, with honey chicken and Mongolian beef, got a side of noodles and Brussels sprouts. In all honesty, I expected the honey chicken to be a little bit crispier, but on the bright side the chicken wasn't dry. For the Mongolian beef, I guess I just expected it to be more moist, but it was quite dry. The lettuce cup was good, it wasn't filled with fillers but had a lot of meat. The flavor on the hand wasn't the same as a traditional Chinese food, but it was still good. For the side of noodles, the server was right the entrée would have had more flavors but for a side it was pretty good with a kick. For the Brussels sprouts it was a better side because it had lots of flavor from sweet from the pineapple and spicy from the peppers. Overall the food was pretty good especially the desert. The banana rolls with the pineapple mango ice cream and the vanilla ice cream was a great way to end our food adventure. The pineapple mango ice cream is something I would recommend everyone to try at least once. I also want to comment on how pleased we were with our sever, Theron. He was very helpful and sweet. Usually my sister gets nervous the server will get upset because we came to try a little of everything. But with Theron he was great and welcoming. He was patient with all of our questions and when we told him about our allergies he made sure to accommodate as much as he can.",92802

We placed a $100+ order for take-out to utilize the Super Bowl promo they were offering. I don't know if this location is always subpar or if they were having an off night tonight. When I went to pick up the order I asked for ""extra soy sauce."" I wound up getting 1 container of soy sauce and 1 container of chili paste. Fortunately, we had some soy sauce at home because the 1 container wasn't going to be adequate for the 5 entrees we purchased. The portions appeared to be skimpier than usual (and I'm not a big eater.) The oddest part was the lettuce wraps. Instead of giving me a bag of lettuce cups like they usually do, I got a head of browning romaine....seriously! WTF?",92802

It then took another 30 minutes for everyone else to get their soup. I had a Buy one entry get a second Free emailed coupon on my cell phone from P F Chang's, So 4 of the group ordered the two-person combos, and myself and one other ordered a single soup, a single salad and our two entrees. So I got my soup and him his salad after that 20 minutes when the others got their appetizers, then waited another 40 minutes to get our dinners.  The wok seared filet mignon I ordered was not very good, the strong salty sauce way overpowering the steak. One piece of the steak, filet mignon?, was just plain chewy, impossible to chew up. Some filet mignon! Then they had a problem processing the check as they could not combine all 6 meals into one check even though the one coupon (emailed by P F Chang's) was buy one entry get the second free for one meal only. Apparently, having more than 2 people eating when using a coupon is not within the P F Chang design. Overall, we were 2 1/2 hours, which is reasonable in France when you eat out, but rather uncommon in the USA. I enjoyed the gathering with my kids and a grandson. I wish I could have said the same for the meal. Never again P F Chang's. Horrible service and horrid filet mignon earns at most one star as that is the lowest you can give.

Water was never refilled (I was mooching off my daughter's after fin). Having spent years in the restaurant business, these are business killers. I guess people just don't know what bad service is. Plus, the atmosphere was pretty raucous and loud enough that we all had to raise our voices just to talk. All this cost us $150 for four people. Yeah. Remembering now why we don't come here that often.  UPDATE - I reached out to customer service as requested right after they posted a response To my review.

Overall, i had a good time with good food, but next time i'll be going to a different p f chang's location.",92802
2717,"321 W Katella Ave Ste 120 Anaheim, CA 92802",Mario V.,"Orange, CA",7/2/2018,2,"We ordered 8 entries. The Mongolian beef was hard and over cooked and closer to a jerky than a tender meat. Also the pad thai was ordered.  We ordered shrimp because this plate is normally done with shrimp unless one asked for it specifically asked for a vegan version. We asked for the regular shrimp version and got hard over cooked tofu. It was so hard it was too tough to tear apart. The spring roll were over cooked and had very little taste. The cause that came with it also lacked taste. The crispy over was ok. It need more orange taste and the sauce also lacked in taste. The lettuce wraps were ok. We ordered as a starter.  The other iteams we ordered were not horrible but ok, not worthy of addressing them specifically.  Now the service.  Katie was our server. We came to our table about four times. Brought the hot sauce for the food at the time the desserts were being offered.  I think she needed assistance.  In general the food was ok, it was acceptable but not super delicious! I addressed these issues with the host, who was lovely, and the manager.  The manager only said""thanks for letting me know"". I thought he would maybe inquire further but he didn't.  Maybe it was not that important to him. The bill was only about $200. Maybe the was more important tables.

They stopped offering the deal without notification a while ago and I was so irritated with their lack of customer service that I didn't return for months. I decided to give them another shot today for takeout and was super disappointed. Their chicken lo mein was terrible - the noodles were so overcooked they had no texture. The pan fried pork dumplings were falling apart. The sweet and sour chicken was mushy. And the steamed rice was dry.  This is hands down the worst restaurant at the Gardenwalk.

Our waitress cared less and as I asked her to bring us please more napkins she responded, oh those cloth napkins are for you to use them. She was rude and not professional. Half of food arrived our table cold. We had to wait 25 minutes to asked for boxes. My husband asked a different waiter to get our check since we didn't see our waitress at all.

Chang's in Walnut Creek, CA.   Back then it was all about making your own special sauce, having soy sauce as salt, chili oil as pepper and vinegar to cool everything down and of course the limo ride (where you as the server orders the whole meal for the guest so just like a limo ride, they can relax and not worry about ordering).  So those days are dead...the special sauce is pre-made and you only get it with lettuce wraps; there is no ""trio"" of sauces always at your table and the limo ride is replaced by a price-fixe meal......but hey things change!  Here is what hasn't changed:***Chicken lettuce wraps are still amazing: they still know how to take ground chicken, water chestnuts, onions and mushrooms, cook it to perfection and lay that over a bed of crispy rice sticks with cool crisp lettuce cups.***Chang's spicy chicken is still fantastic: chunks of white meat chicken dusted with potato starch to add a little crunch and then stirfried in a sweet spicy sauce...SO GOOD***Mongolian beef is still unbeatable: I don't even eat beef anymore but we get this and add broccoli to it so I can have stirfried broccoli in the sauce...delicious***Anything orange peel: Orange peel chicken, shrimp or beef is still great.  Love the tangy spicy citrus sauce***Kung Pao Shrimp and Scallops still better than anywhere else: Especially the scallops which they dust with potato starch to make more crunchy paired in that dark sauce with just the right amount of kick and spice***Spicy Long beans are so yummilicious and now you can order it as a side dish!  I'm always going with a full order but it's nice to have optionsWe've hosted a birthday party at this location and then eaten at the bar a bunch of times.  Service is pretty consistent for a chain restaurant and what we order is always good.  We've tried SO many Chinese restaurants since I moved here and we really can't find anywhere nearly as good as the places we used to frequent up north, so I'm grateful to have P.F.

I started on a gluten-free diet a couple of months ago, and eating out has been difficult, to say the least. Eating at Asian restaurants has pretty much been impossible; few places provide gluten-free options, and many don't even know what gluten is. That's why I was so happy to discover that PF Chang's is super gluten-friendly. They have a lot of gluten-free options and even place these foods in specific dishes which they only use for gluten-free foods. To be honest, I expected PF Chang's to be a glorified Panda Express. I was wrong. The food is delicious and, as far as I'm concerned, authentic enough. I have no complaints about the quality of the food here. I ordered the gluten-free lettuce chicken wraps, egg drop soup, and chicken fried rice. All were delicious. Our waiter was very accommodating. He probably stopped by our table every 15 minutes to ask if we needed anything and/or to fill water. Ambiance of this place is incredible and perfect for a nice date with your significant other. It is kind of noisy, but we went during dinner time on a Friday night. I'm very tempted to give this place 5 stars, but I can't bring myself to do so. Why? Way too expensive. Expect a regular dish to be $15-25. The portion size is moderately sized, but not enough to make someone like me full. I'd probably need to order an appetizer and a soup on the side, making a full meal for me anywhere from $20-$35 depending on what I get as my main course. Gluten-free foods even cost a couple dollars more than regular. Overall, I had a very positive experience. Food is amazing. Price is not.",92802

Back then, I remember having their chicken fried rice, Sea Bass with Spinach and the Salt and pepper prawns.  They were all outstanding, however, today we had the Waldorf salad, hot and sour soup, garlic noodles and the Northern spare ribs. Unfortunately, the only item we liked were the Northern spare ribs.The garlic noodles was plain and lightly sweetened, but not too bad, definitely three stars at max.  The hot and sour soup tasted more salty than hot (spicy) or sour. The Waldorf salad tasted a little bitter, maybe due to the type of lettuce that was being utilized. Every other items is a 2 stars max, other than the Northern spare ribs.Initially, the service was great, I even gave him about a 30% tips. Our waiter was friendly, but the only recommendation I have for him was to check with us if we needed anything. We did not get one refills for our drinks, nor offer to get desserts. So we just decided to grab a refill to go and skip the desserts this time around. Hoping for a better experience, but certainly had worst.Our bill came out to about $39 and with $11 tips, it came out to $50. Was the meal and experience worth that? Maybe not, but I must say, it's fair to give them a three stars because I did have a much better experience last time. So I am going to just assume this was an off moment experience. Most likely will not come back, not to this location anyway. I do want to say thank you for having a clean booth. I have not sat at a clean booth at a place to eat without having to wipe it down myself in awhile.

We even asked for the manager who then also repeatedly made us feel like we were crazy and that it was not freezing cold and blowing air is just circulating air.

I feel that sometimes is hit and miss with waiters and waitresses at restaurants, but this time around our waiter was phenomenal. It was very attentive very helpful and very patient. If you have been here before, well you already know that the food is good! But if you havent it, then you really have to try the lettuce wraps. The restaurant was busy but it wasn't overbusy where he was unbearable. Maybe it was the fact that it was during the week and not the weekend.

CHANG'S . . .Why, when I placed the order (at the Irvine Spectrum) it couldn't be ready sooner than 30 minutes, I don't know!But I did show up 2 minutes early & parked at the curbside and went into the restaurant to pick up my order, where the hostess informed me the order wasn't ready yet & it would it would still take a few more minutes to get ready.FINE!  Figure I would wait . . . yet after 10 minutes the second hostess informed me that the order was ""being finished"" and do I mind having a seat.  Well, yes, I minded very much,  You can tell me I am wrong, but it appears to me that someone forgot to place my order and they had just started it.  Please don't try to fool me otherwise.  The restaurant may have appeared somewhat busy, but it was only half full on this Thursday night.  I simply wasn't willing to wait because someone forgot to start my order . . . I understand that with chain restaurants like yours such orders go through a processing center . . . but it shouldn't have needed 30 minutes in the first place . . . I bet it would have taken 10-20 minutes tops if I was seated in the restaurant & ordering it in person.  I TOLD THEM TO CANCEL MY ORDER AND I WALKED OUT!!!BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE!!This is the second strike against you, P.F. Chang's.  One year ago I contracted an intestinal parasite, Giardia, from another location (Newport Beach) form an order of the Chicken Waldorf salad I had, and I required a 10 day course of antibiotics in order to treat it!  I am pretty sure it was the Kale ingredient that was contaminated.  Luckily I am a physician and was able to recognize the infection and treat it promptly!I do not like this kind of service . . . I do not like eating contaminated foods either.If I continue to encounter similar problems, I will guarantee you that I WILL NOT BE RETURNING . . . and I will post on social media of my direct experiences with P.F.

One of the dishes should have been reheated, it wasn't hot when it arrived. Even with these problems, the food was okay. You kind of know what youre getting at a chain like this.

2783,"321 W Katella Ave Ste 120 Anaheim, CA 92802",Liz N.,"Anaheim, CA",5/12/2019,5,P.F Chang's will never disappoint you. You get what you pay for and then some! I love the food and mostly the amount that we get for the price we pay. I come from a big family and when we go out to restaurants it's sometimes hard to make decisions on where to go that would fit everyone's taste. Thankfully P.F Chang's has something for everyone in my family and most likely yours as well. The staff is very friendly and the managers are very involved with their guest. Depending on what day and time you go you might be waiting 10 minutes or about 45 minutes for your food. Quick tip: If you want a quick sit down meal heading out to this P.F Chang's especially on a weekend night might not be the place for you. Being the fact that they are right next to Disneyland this location in particular gets very very busy. I personally am a patient person and completely understand that businesses get busy every now and then. However not everyone knows how to patiently wait. And instead of leaving guests sometimes decide to make the staff's job harder than it should be. Good things come to those who wait. Overall my family and I absolutely love this place and we encourage everyone and anyone to give it a try! As I stated it won't disappoint.,92802
2784,"321 W Katella Ave Ste 120 Anaheim, CA 92802",Gizelle M.,"Santa Ana, CA",1/6/2020,1,"So where do I begin.. After a long 12 hour shift working with children on top of being 5 months pregnant, of course you don't want to go home to cook and clean. My boyfriend decided to take me out for the night to be spoiled. Mind you I've never been to P.G Chang's ever so to go there being all fancy and stuff I was at awh when walking in there. The hostess sat us at our table and I'm looking at the menu. About 10 minutes later there was this older white couple that sat in the next table to us. So this short chubby white waitress which I didn't get her name(find out later by the manager her name is Karen) took the couples order right off the bat and they seemed to be regulars of hers. The waitress(Karen) was chit chatting her life away with them while I'm over here looking around at her and other waiters/waitresses to see who's going to take our drink order at least to get started.  I was already irritated and my boyfriend ask Karen ""we have been sitting here for about 10 minutes and no one has taken our order yet."" She had the audacity to respond to my boyfriend saying, ""another waitress will help you out."" All I can do was look at her and bite my tongue and not go off on her considering I'm pregnant, hungry, and tired. I saw another young waitress attending another family that walked in after us already with their drink and appetizers on the table! I told my boyfriend that I will go ask the hostess who will take our order if not we will just order it to go. I walk over to the hostess and let her know what happened all she can do is apologize and tried to get someone at our table to serve us right away. So I sat down and waited a few more minutes. I got over it and ask my boyfriend to just order it to go and leave. Just the vibe itself I did not like at all. As my boyfriend is ordering for us, I ask the hostess if I can speak to the manager. Moments later I believe her name was Kim? She came out to hear my complaint and I explained the situation of what happened. She apologized for the inconvenience and offered to pay for our meal which was greatly appreciated. Kim took care of my boyfriend and I. But overall I'll just say for the first time experience, I hated it and I will for sure will not be coming back to this location. In a way I felt discriminated because of my race or probably because I wasn't dressed right for the restaurant I personally do not know. Secondly I feel like Karen either needs to be fired or be given some customer service classes to accommodate the customer and the job title itself. I personally I have worked in retail and fast food for 7 years and I know to never treat my guest or customers in such manner. The least she could've done for us is say, ""meanwhile you are waiting let me take your drink order and I will let your waiter/waitress know you are ready."" Simple as that! I hope management gets to see this and replace whoever is not fit for the job because I do not dare on my worst enemy to be treated the way I was tonight.",92802

Food:Appetizer Vegetable Lettuce Wraps: my favorite! really good flavor and even sharing with two it's filling!Entrees:Pad Thai: I liked the flavor and the cilantro on top was a nice touch.Garlic noodles: Really good! It says it's spicy, but it really wasn't at all.Mo Po Tofu: ask for it with crispy tofu, delicious! Although the broccoli pieces were very large and not cooked all the way which was hard to cut up and eat.Cashew chicken (with Tofu instead): the sauce lacked flavor, but the veggies and tofu were cooked perfectly. And ask for extra cashews, I didn't see much in there.Drink:Strawberry Cucumber Limeade: yummm! I really liked this drink. The strawberry and lime was the main flavor but you also had a  hint of cucumber and it was so refreshing on a hot day!Our server was really nice and attentive, although she did disappear towards the end and we were looking for her for a few minutes.

The two hostess seemed nice as they greeted me and my friend as we walked in. However, one of the girls was completely rude; yawning while taking our name. The wait wasn't long so that was good. We got seated and then waited for our server. I noticed the hostess that seated us was nearby standing with a server holding onto each other like they are a couple. I mean come on... Be professional here. Our server Jimmy was really nice and helpful. He took our drink order and gave us some time to look at the menu. Everything was going well until our food came out. We ordered the Lobster fried rice and a beef dish to share between the two of us. So I asked the food runner if I can get an extra bowl (to share), and he says ""bowl of what?"" So I replied, ""just a bowl"". And he replies back, ""like...empty?"" as if I was asking a huge favor from him. There was no spoon with the fried rice so I flagged down our server and ask for a spoon to scoop the rice. He comes back with the spoon in a napkin and I go to pick it up. And what do you know...it's an ice cream spoon. I chose not to believe that was the only spoon PF Chang's had. I mean if I was on dessert I could understand the tiny spoon, but I was still on my entree. That just really killed it for us. We just wanted to get out of there. We barely started eating and we wanted to leave. We asked for the check and to go boxes and took our food home to eat. I don't know if it's because this location is next to Disney or what their deal is, their staff should really adjust their attitude and use some common sense. I'm only giving this location 1 star because our server was really nice and patient with us. He technically didn't do anything wrong by bringing me a spoon, but why a dessert spoon...The food... Eh. Fried rice description is a lot better than it tastes. Very sad looking with a wad on cilantro thrown on top. Beef was overwhelmed with green onions, but flavor was good. If it wasn't for the gift card from work, I wouldn't ever come back",92802

The service and attention to the customer was excellent.  I made an online reservation and came in 5 minutes early and the host checked us in and had us seated right away. Our waiter, Jason, greeted us with a smile and efficiently took our drink and food order. After 15 minutes, he came back and apologize for the delay of the food coming out of the kitchen and offered us complimentary egg drop soup (which my daughter described as 'delightful') and lettuce wrap to hold us over from our hunger. We truly appreciated the gesture. Like I said, P.F. Chang's is our comfort restaurant and Jason is the only one that has treated us with genuine kindness and concern. Thanks Jason and P.F.

The food was not better than average take out and not as good as some take out I have had.  Their well known lettuce wraps came without the sauce so it was half eaten by our table before that arrived. The beef and broccoli consisted of broccoli very firm with nothing on it, no sauce or liquid of any kind and excellent beef. I did notice upon leaving that the dish on another table was prepared the usual way. None of the 3 people at the entrance desk were welcoming or even a little friendly.  We were bluntly told in response to giving them our name ""You are late, you will have to wait"" . We were 15 minutes late due to underground parking (which we were not aware of) and which resulted in a 15 minute walk.  On the upside the Martinis were outstanding and our server, Josh,  was very good.Oh...and who serves a sushi roll with no wasabi or ginger?",92802

Indoors is a little darker and has a more intimate feel--if you've ever been to a PF Chang's before anywhere else, this is like the rest. They also have a really nice outdoor seating which I found had a lot more space and had a calmer feel. My father and I really enjoyed the food! We ate there on Saturday, and then came back for dinner on Monday as well. Here are the dishes we had:Vegetarian lettuce wraps: These are like the regular lettuce wraps, except for tiny cubes of tofu instead of chicken. They were delicious! The dipping sauce I didn't particularly care for--I found they tasted better just by themselves.Buddha's feast: This is basically a huge plate of steamed vegetables. Very good but nothing particularly fancy. The best thing about this dish was that we used the sauces from other dishes to flavor this.Vegetable curry: I was rather lukewarm about this dish. Tasted OK but I was not excited.Chile eggplant dish: This was my favorite!! It is a spicy dish, and really delicious. The eggplant is to die for, and you we used the sauce to flavor the vegetables from our other dishes.Spicy tofu and broccoli: This was another really, really good dish. The tofu is amazing, the best tofu I have EVER had! The texture was perfect, and the sauce really tasty. The is heaped on top of a huge bed of broccoli, which with the sauce was really delicious as well. The brocolli was cooked just right, and not too soft.I hadn't been to PF Changs in a long time before this, but the experience was so enjoyable that I am definitely going to go more often!",92802

Calamari wasn't great either. the breading was literally just coating the squid, when I took a bite the squid inside didn't even look or feel like it was fried? It felt like it was reheated or something. Food over priced. The dessert makes me laugh at how it tries to mimic actual Asian desserts by using similar ingredients to pull it off. Well nice try though.Idk we came during happy hour and everything came out to $75.00.. what the.. Service was okay. I can tell my waiter hated his job. Pretty monotone.

The appetizers I routinely order are the lettuce wraps and pork dumplings. The main course is the tea smoked Chilean sea bass, which is excellent. This is a solid 4 star course. If you don't like fish, the house chicken dish is pretty good. Never had an issue with service, and the atmosphere is pleasant.",92802
2803,"321 W Katella Ave Ste 120 Anaheim, CA 92802",Cristina B.,"Redwood City, CA",4/6/2015,3,"They take reservations. Make use of this information. I came here during Wondercon 2015 at the Anaheim Convention Center, and we were told 1.5 hour wait, but we were able to snag some seats at the bar. The service was great and the restrooms were clean, but it was frustrating to be told of such a long wait with empty tables all over, so I assume it was a staffing issue? Hopefully that's something they can fix in the future, as this is one of the few restaurants that caters to the dietary needs within my group of friends (celiac and vegetarian).",92802
2804,"321 W Katella Ave Ste 120 Anaheim, CA 92802",Scott A.,"Wasilla, AK",5/25/2017,1,"The food was mediocre. I ordered kung pao chicken and was not impressed. The sushi rice was dry and seemed to have been left out all day long. My daughters chicken was so dry and hard that she thought it was bones. To top things off the waiter and bus boy collided behind me and a tray of drinks was dropped behind me. This resulted in the back and sleeves of my jacket, which was hanging on the chair, to become drenched. The liquid also went all over my legs and shoes. I received and apology and a towel. Most restaurant would have offered to comp a desert or meal. I wasn't looking to take advantage of the situation - in fact when I was leaving and mentioned this to the manager she offered and I declined. I don't want to have to prompt them in to how to treat their customers. My recommendation, if you want Asian food, find a low-key Chinese restaurant that is off the beaten path. They have the best food and service.",92802

The gentleman at front first claimed that there wasn't a call, then there was and then confirmed the check in and said that he had made in error and it should be ready within another 30 mins. Before we left after waiting another-hour and half after they said 30 mins, I confirmed the sequence of events and their only excuse was that they made an adding error and accidentally sat 2 large parties in error before us. I relayed the information and they stated they let 2 large parties cut in front of us in their error. This is this locations ethics and accountability.

So my review is based mainly on the service. Our waitress looked rushed most of the time, maybe she had lots of tables? I don't know... I couldn't tell, because it was between lunch and dinner time so it didn't look to busy in there, but it's also a pretty big place.So when we asked her a couple of questions, two of us, not the whole group, she seemed a bit annoyed, tad bit awkward/uncomfortable, tbh. After that, nobody wanted to really ask her anything, makes it weird, makes it uncomfortable... Just not as enjoyable as it could be. The food was good, so that's why the 3 stars.",92802

Isn't the table supposed to be ready at that time. But we had to wait for 20 minutes. I came to ask twice to see if the table was ready, they always said that they were cleaning up. 5 mins later, my cousin came to ask the reception guy, Carlos, again. My cousin wondered why it took so long to clean under the table for 20mins. It could just take around 5 mins. Carlos then told my cousin :"" you should be doing it then"". that was just so RUDE.

I am ashamed to say so, but I like this food.Orange chicken- flavorful & light-crispy-nessBroccoli beef- a little too much sauce, but the right flavorcombo fried rice- A good mix of meat, but not enough shrimp & didn't have that special flavor to it- seemed like it had a lot of brown sauce, whatever it wasMushu pork- This had very strong bamboo flavor, and not enough meat.Overall, I would eat here again, I'd previously had some fried wontons & the sushi isn't that bad either.

We did complain and they offered us to move but we were 30 minutes in and at that point it was inconvenient to us to move. The service was terrible, table never cleared of empty glasses and app plates. We had to flag down someone for refills and for our table to be cleared so the main entrees would fit. Only brought out 3 servings of rice for all of usAs for the food..VERY disappointed the wings were taken off the menu, the salt and pepper calamari seems to have been changed as well. Portion very small.Didn't they used to make a better sauce for the lettuce wraps?  Honey Walnut shrimp was terrible. I just think for the money you pay here its not worth it.

We had the Chang for two meals and it was a great deal. The reason why I am giving 2 starts is because there is mold in the bathroom vent. Went to the restroom and looked up and it was all over. You can tell it's been scrubbed but you can't wash mold off. This is a health hazard and when telling staff, they were so casual about it and didn't seem to care about the concern.

We ordered Mongolian beef, crispy honey chicken, sesame chicken, lettuce wraps, walnut shrimp, and wonton soup. We ended up needing to order two more entrees and they had them out right away!

2831,"321 W Katella Ave Ste 120 Anaheim, CA 92802",Darrus B.,"Downtown, Los Angeles, CA",12/3/2018,1,"By far the worst dining experience that I have ever had . For starters I work in the industry so I am quite understanding and aware of how hard the job is being a server and managing in the service industry . That being said service , cleanliness and the overall hospitality was appalling . We arrived from Disneyland at about 11:15pm on Friday Night  which was the last hour of dining for the restaurant . What I was struck by first upon walking in was the greeting from the host  or manager not sure of which, However  it was non welcoming . We were sat at a table which was directly under a vent , very cold . The menus were filthy and stained . We waited about 8 mins to be greeted by our server . The sever greeted us very coldly saying that he would be right with us . It appeared he was doing his closing side work or checking out the other servers not sure . Another 5 mins passes and then our server returns to ask for our order . 13 mins for a proper greeting . My fiancé's  family were visiting from out of the country so it  was embarrassing considering the service   . We ordered Honey chicken , General Spicy Chang's Chicken ,  Black Pepper Chicken and Tempura Rolls . We ordered two glasses of Malbec which took over 15 mins to come , 15 mins for glasses of wine . In seeing how non busy it was it should not have taken 15 mins for two glasses of wine . When the wine comes it was served improperly with no tasting . No sauces were prepared which struck me as odd as well . We asked about the  air conditioning and how cold it was and the server said that nothing can be done . There was no manager present on the floor . I went to the host at the front and asked who would I speak with about commenting on my experience and she replied to go on line ??  My mother in law ordered coffee that came out cold . We asked for another coffee and that took another 7 mins . My sister in law and her husband ordered a coke that never came out which we had to ask for again  and then it came out .  Food came out Lukewarm not hot but we ate it . We paid leaving a 20 percent tip for an experience that was poor ( hospitality industry Karma ) . For me to leave a review like this is a testament to how horrible the experience was . The gentlemen whose name I will not say,  our server had a shaved head and glasses . His service along with the lack of support from his management team  , the lack of cleanliness and the unfriendliness of the greeter was enough for me to not ever step foot in a P.F. Chang's again .  No table visit or acknowledgement from a manager , wow! Coming from a place like Disneyland where hospitality and service is a second language and an earlier day dining experience at the original pancake house which was phenomenal , the experience at this P.F. Chang's was underwhelming and horrible across the board ...",92802

Checked back around 8:00 pm and told us that the 7 pm reservations were still waiting. Ugh, seriously? Finally at 8:29 pm we were seated. Yes, 1 hour, 1 whole damn hour that we waited! Good thing our server named Trevor was awesome. I'll give him a 5 star for his customer service. On our way out, none of the ladies where you check in said bye nor thank you....they need to be trained by Trevor. Food was good but im not too sure with time management.

We ordered beef and broccoli, sweet and sour chicken and Kung pow chicken. As I was eating my Kung Pow Chicken I noticed a VERY fishy taste. (I'm a non seafood eater and it makes me gag.) long story short manager comes over and tells us she would go talk to the cook to see what happen. She never came back to tell us what happen. Waitress asked if we wanted them to remake it. I decline because I'm just so sick to my stomach over the taste. My husband was with me and he was still eating so they made him a fresh plate. We get our bill and the manager took the chicken off but very disappointed that she never came back to explain what happen. I'm not sure if I will ever go back.",92802

For some reason I expected the Chinese food here to taste amazing but honestly it was mediocre compared to what I've had at familly owned restaurants for about half the price. Its just too much dough to fork out for honestly tasteless food. Its like they are afraid of seasoning in this place. Also as far as service goes. A lot of the staff just acted like they hate that you're there. I work in foods too so I would understand being tired but we got attitude for not particular reason and it kinda made the night uncomfortable.,92802

I went here with the gf and it was pretty busy. So we took seats at the bar which was not so busy. Our waitress took our order, we ordered and appetizer, an entree, and two drinks. Th drinks came out followed by the appetizer. We were asked by a waiter not our waitress if we were doing fine and if we needed anything and we kindly said no. We were given the bill for the drinks, appetizer and entree but the entree never came. We waited patiently and the entree never came. The waiter came over again not our server and asked in a surprised manner if we were still waiting for food, what tipped him off the pristine silver ware and untouched plate in front of us? We said yes and he was shocked, he went to find our food it never was cooked. We told him to charge us minus the entree he did, we tried to pay he walked off to continue to hangout with another male waiter and our waitress ignoring us again. We flagged down another waitress to help us pay and she got the attention of our original server. She finally came back and helped us pay our check. Her body language while helping us was that of disinterest and made it seem like we were bothering her. I would give this place a one star but I feel it's too mean so I give it a two star, it's not ok to treat anyone who is Hungary and tired this way especially when we are from out of town. There is a little bit more to this story but that's the gist, please go somewhere else and stop paying rude people's salaries.",92802

Its a shame I forgot his name. Overall the food was great, I loved the dynamite shrimp appetizer , it has a spicy kick to it - then we had chicken noodle soup that my husband loves, and for entrees , the lo- me in and spicy chicken , brown rice was perfect. The down side was the dessert - i expected a bigger portion for two- but since i was stuffed with the food already i didn't mind it was just enough to satisfy my sweet tooth.",92802

The three star rating however, was due to the fact that everything tasted like pure salt! My sister joked around saying the menu options should say salted chicken, even saltier chicken, or sweet and salty chicken. That's basically the gist of it.If you do decide to go though, make sure to try their chocolate dome for dessert. It's still a little salty but definitely complements the chocolate (which is flour less and also gluten free). It's unbelievably AMAZING!",92802

While the location is central to the convention center and Disneyland an easy to walk to for those staying at neighboring hotels, it's a nightmare once inside. Our host ""lost"" our reservation which was made just moments before. They then ""found it"" yet continued to make us wait for over 1/2 an hour. Our waitress was wonderful, but some of the other waiters smelled strongly of alcohol. Perhaps they spilled something on themselves, but it extremely noticeable even from a table or two away. Service was SLOW! As in, I think the hand chose, killed, cleaned, and then cooked the chicken we ordered. Portions were large, and meant for sharing. We each chose to get out own entree and we walked away full and with some leftovers. Prices are nothing special - what you'd expect from a comparable chain. Sadly, my experience reminded me why I don't dine here when in Anaheim on business. You'd be better off driving 1/2 a mile and going somewhere else.",92802

I always like to check out the restroom because it's a good indicator of how the back of house is treated. The paper towel trash bin was overflowing with several paper towels on the floor. Service was friendly however after we ordered our meals it took a really long time to get our food. We had the lo mein, spicy chicken (which wasn't spicy at all) and the Mongolian beef.

A bit disappointed that they sort of changed up my orange peel chicken but still, everything was cooked to perfection. I also had the won ton soup but I would never order it again only because I don't like seafood.  Hubby had the egg drop soup and he wouldn't order it again because it's like a raw egg was dropped in it. Duh. Haha. He had the fried rice with everything in it and loved it. We had some raspberry chocolate won ton I believe but we were so full, it was not as enjoyable. Also had the cucumber sesame side. Simply delish. Oh yeah, let's not forget the calamari my hubby wolfed down and my perfectly cooked chicken lettuce wraps that he also wouldn't stop eating.

My dine-in experiences here have always been stellar. They give great service and I've never had a complaint. Their catering/to-go side of the business, however, is a bit of a different story. They tend to occasionally forget an item (especially on large orders), and they never give plates or napkins--I don't know whether they just don't stock these items, or they don't readily want to give them out, but it's proven inconvenient every now and then depending on where you're ordering the food for (and if that place has its own place settings on hand).  Anyway, nothing horrible by any measure, but could use improvement so I'd give the take-out arm of the business only about 4 stars at most.",92802

I think we saw our waiter once the whole time we were here (props to the food runner for doing her job for her) and she took over 20 minutes to come get our drink and food order, then she disappeared. The hostess was rarely at her stand, she seemed too busy gossiping with the waitstaff in the back. The food took longer than usual to come out, but our fried rice and Mongolian beef were good (the beef was excellent actually).",92802

It was busy for Sunday dinner, mostly filled with large groups from a convention. Food was less than average and portions were small - very disappointing. Pepper steak - nice flavor, but way too much gooey sauce on topPad Thai with Chicken and Shrimp - flavor also good, but very disappointing. Noodles were overcooked and falling apart. Bean sprouts were also overcooked, and not crunchy like how pad thai should be. Chicken was white meat and too dry to be edible. Shrimp was sparse and very tiny (less than half an inch).Both portions were small, we left feeling hungry.Service - Server was polite, but had to apologized for long food wait. Also forgot to bring rice. One plus for bringing last soda refill in to go cup.Disappointed I wasted my money here. Won't be returning.",92802

2906,"321 W Katella Ave Ste 120 Anaheim, CA 92802",Andrew L.,"San Leandro, CA",5/10/2018,2,"I bring my kids here for dinner whenever we are in town to visit Disneyland. This is one of the few places where my kids have a good appetite. On April 20, 2018, everything was fine like our previous experiences. Waitress was pleasant. Food came quickly and was hot. We paid with a gift card, but we were told that it had not been activated. The waitress told us the issue. She said she will contact the manager to see if she could further investigate. She asked us to be patient. We waited for a few minutes. The manager and another (possible) assistant came and explained the additional steps they took to verify if the gift card was activated and/or spent. They confirmed that the card was never activated. We were grateful they took the time to investigate, but it sucked that we do not remember who gave us the gift card and we do not have the receipt portion that shows it was activated. April 22, 2018, we came back again. It was about 6 PM and we were seated in the patio area. Another family of four sat next to us. Waitress 1 took our drink orders and it came quickly. Waitress 1 said she was going on break and Waiter 2 will replace her. Waiter 2 took our order then he took the order from the other family of four. It was a coincidence they ordered the same dishes as we did for our children (noodles and fried rice with a side or broccoli). Within 15 minutes, Waitress 3 brings out a plate of noodles an fried rice for the other family. We waited 10 more minutes and Waiter 2 brings out my order along with my wife's. He said that he was going to check on our children's orders. 5 more minutes goes by and he brings out a plate of noodles and fried rice for the other family. The other family acknowledged that they received their order. Waiter 2 told them to just keep the additional dishes and he walked away.  Waiter 2 comes back shortly after and we advised him that our children had yet to receive their order. He advised he would go check with the kitchen. 10 minutes later, a woman (dressed like a manager) brings out a plate of noodles and fried rice and apologized to us. However, she showed no sincere/sympathetic emotions or facial expression besides looking slightly annoyed. She placed the plates down on our table. Apologized again without showing any sympathy and walked away. I looked at my son's fried rice and side of steamed broccoli. The broccoli looked like it was just grabbed out of the package and was tossed around a pan/wok for 30 seconds - the broccoli was still raw.  It was too hard for my toddler to eat. We couldn't enjoy our dinner it took nearly one hour for our kids to get their food and we couldn't feed them our food because it was too spicy for them. It was getting late and we wanted to get to the Disney Parks. Waitress 1 came back as the other family left with their 3 boxes of leftovers. We just asked for the check, paid, and left. Due to the time of day and the mood of our children, we did not have time to have a talk with the management staff about our experience and confusion and inconsistencies with the staff attending to us. Unfortunately, we will be coming back again because my kids loves the food here",92802

No delay for those of us at the two-top tables and that's not always the case in a bustling, packed dining room.  Our waiter was Jason, ask for him! Not only did he make suggestions about the menu that broadened our PF Chang's dining experience, he gave us great advice about our planned trip to the Mouse House down the street.

I walked over from my hotel in like 10 minutes and they said they would check and see how much longer and actually had it ready in less than 15!

She loves their Sesame Chicken but had made a comment she would try something else due to this special occasion. Well, she ordered the sesame chicken...we laughed, the waiter said it was his favorite too. It came and was inedible. No flavor, bland...in fact, everything was not up to par this night. We were highly disappointed. We were looking forward to it, what a let down. We left 80% of our meals at the table, no to-go boxes and spend a pretty penny. The best thing we had was the Happy Hour Lettuce Wraps. Won't be back.",92802

I go for my birthday every year! The reason I'm writing this review is because on my birthday this year, I went, and as usual, my family and I ordered dishes to share (not picks from the lunch menu). The food came out looking like it was sitting on the counter for a while (which could be worse, I guess), but the food also came out in TINY portions. The Sweet and Sour Chicken I ordered literally had 12 pieces of chicken on it. It was a tiny little heap in the middle of the plate. It cost $13.95!!Last time I went I also noticed that their portions were getting smaller, but I thought maybe it was just that day. This is the second time that happened... So, I think I won't be going on my next Birthday - which is so sad. It's delicious!",92802
2914,"321 W Katella Ave Ste 120 Anaheim, CA 92802",Oliver C.,"Artesia, CA",7/7/2016,3,"First time trying P.F. Chang's after hearing about it for all my life. It is billed as an asian themed American restaurant or an Asian American fusion restaurant. It seems like they combined an American fine dining atmosphere with an Asian American inspired menu. Many of the menu items can readily be found at your neighborhood Panda Express. The only dish that I was surprised to find on the menu was the lettuce wrap which you can really only find at a Chinese restaurant, and even then not that many have that dish. P.F. Chang's does use better quality ingredients. For example, I had Mongolian beef and the beef didn't taste like mystery meat and was sauteed well, though the cook went a little overboard with the sauce making it overly salty. The price wasn't that great for the type of food I had. My friend and I had a 4 course meal with their dinner for 2 for about $45 or so but it was almost all standard food (egg drop soup, hot and sour soup, chicken fried rice, mongolian beef). Gluten free items have a $2.00 upcharge which, until that night, I did not know was pretty standard for gluten free items at restaurants. In the end it was still Asian food. It was a surprise tasting Chinese food cooked with better ingredients and I enjoyed the change. At the same time, I find the takeout Chinese food store on the street corner of Anytown, USA pretty much can satisfy my need for Americanized Asian food. P.F. Chang's interior is great for a nice sit down meal, but for me Asian food and the ambiance of the restaurant just don't go together, and that ambiance is what you are really paying for at P.F. Chang's.",92802

I come here when I crave the Dynamite Shrimp and the Combo Lo Mein. I like that all the menu items are sharable portions. Happy hour menu is actually pretty good as well, lots to choose from and decent prices. (only at the bar) Usually spend about $40-$50 on 2 Sapporros (sp?) and food for 2 people during happy hour (I love to eat).I DO NOT recommend their cocktails. On different occasions I ordered their specialty drinks and did not like them at all. I had to send them back and get a beer instead. Service is actually pretty good, I've never had any complaints on the service. 5 stars only if the cocktails were better.",92802

Not even kidding, so when PF Chang's was suggested for dinner, I was all-in. We headed over around 9 pm, and the place was pretty busy. With a 30-40 min wait for a table, we chose to sit on the patio right away. A bit chilly, but there were heat lamps (and I was starving!). We ordered a few things (the food is good for sharing), including dumpling soup and beef and broccoli (my favourite!). We had 3 orders for 2 people, and had enough for leftovers!

Food was supposed to be ready for pickup half an hour ago and it's still not ready. On top of that the worker that's supposed to be at the take out counter is nowhere to be seen and the hosts in the front are no help either. They just keep saying to wait at the counter but no one has shown up for 20 minutes now. And the line for pick up is just getting longer. Whoever is supposed to be working take out should definitely be fired. I can't begin to imagine how the in house service is compared to this. If I didn't already order my food over an hour ago I would just go get food someplace else. There's plenty of better restaurants nearby that definitely have better service. -10/100 wouldn't recommend.,92802

Stay away from the Brussel Sprouts.  I am not sure what they use on their Brussel sprouts but the ingredients will mess your stomach up.(No it's not the spices cause I eat spicy food all day and have no issue with anything spicy or Hot). I think they use subpar ingredients in their oil.  My friend and I ordered them and the next day they had us going to bathroom all day.  Everyone else in the party was OK except the two of us who ordered the same side dish (Brussel Sprouts). I am not sure if they use Grade A or non = GMO or cheap ingredients but something had both or our stomachs messed up the whole day.  We were not sick  so no nausea or anything of that nature. just having to go to the bathroom all day.  Other than that.  It was good.  I was not blown away but it was good.,92802

I ordered my entree after I finished my appetizer and waited for 5-10 min. By the time I ordered I was full. The food was alright.. It wasn't amazing as I thought it would be.

My brother picked this location for his birthday dinner, and I was not looking forward to it. But, it was great and I am glad we came!Our server was amazing, first of all. We had a party of 7, and none of us ever ran out of drinks. He was constantly checking on us and was able to answer every question asked of him.For starters we ordered Chicken Lettuce Wraps, Egg Rolls, and Calamari. I also ordered a small cup of egg drop soup for myself.My egg drop soup was good - but different. I believe it had a beef broth base, which is weird for egg drop. Different, for sure, but not bad. I tried the calamari and it was good, until somebody at our table poured salt all over it. Yuck. But, prior to that, I enjoyed the calamari, it was cooked well and I liked the dipping sauce. I didn't eat the rest of the appetizers, but everybody seemed to enjoy them.For entees we ordered:Crispy Honey Chicken - Effing delicious!Pepper Steak - Super Good!Chengdu Spiced Lamb - Surprisingly great - probably my favorite of the night - pretty spicy though!Sweet & Sour Pork - I didn't try this, but everybody enjoyed it.Shrimp with Candied Walnuts - This was okay, I thought the shrimp was a little fishy, but the sauce and the melons were great!Double Pan Fried Noodles - Mmmm, so good. i wish we had ordered two orders of these so I could have had more!So, six entrees for seven people - there was nothing leftover, and there wasn't enough for anybody to get seconds of anything. But, none of us walked away hungry.After dinner certain people ordered the mini desserts - I didn't have any, but they were all happy with what they got.This was a great experience that definitely makes up for the bad time I had a couple years ago.

So get it while it last!) We mostly came here for the chicken lettuce wraps because its their signature appetizer dish here and we always liked eating them.  We always order extra lettuce with this dish (its free so why not).   If you've never had this before you must try it.   CHANG'S SPICY CHICKEN:  Tender, diced chicken breast lightly dusted and stir-fried with a tangy sauce of sweet and spice.  Their chicken is WHITE which is what I like about the dish.  The sauce reminds me of eating mcdonald's chicken nuggets with ""sweet & sour sauce"".   I didn't taste any spiciness in this dish even though the name is spicy chicken....its more of ""sweet and sour chicken"" instead. This dish was $13.95 which should have cost $7-8 instead.  The portion is like at panda express..but because its with white chicken breast thats why it cost that much.  MONGOLIAN BEEF: Tender flank steak wok-cooked then quickly tossed with scallions and garlic.  I've tried this dish twice and its really good...but its best with iceberge lettuce instead of rice. (the one in lettuce wrap).  Yes I'm kinda crazy eating like the korean people: mongolian beef wrap.  But the idea of it is pretty healthy when you think about it.  You're getting your veggies in this meal though so why not go for it.  DAN DAN NOODLES: Scallions, garlic and chili peppers stir-fried with ground chicken and served over hot egg noodles.       -  We ordered this dish once and NEVER EVER gonna eat this dish again!!!!  It was the worse dish here or maybe the chef had made it worse, I don't know but all I can say is YUCK!!!.       - The taste reminds me of spoil food, yes that's how bad it had tasted.  The noodle was soggy mix with spean sprouts and cucumber, and chicken.  There wasn't anything special about this dish at all....We ate 25% of it and left the rest.  I've tried not to waste the food, but I couldn't continue eating it since it didn't tasted that good.  I didn't even TOGO it home either.     - I don't recommend this entree but you are welcome to try and waste your money on it.  PF CHANG 4  COURSE MEAL FOR TWO FOR $39.95:  If you hungry this option is good for a couple of 2.  Which includes a choice of soup, starter appetizer, 2 entree and 2 mini desserts.  The portions are the same even if you had order them separately and you'll save a lot of money.SERVICE: service here is good...well if you get good service and good food then good tip for the waiter or waitress right.   So far I haven't had any bad service yet.   This location is really noisy ...I feel like I have to raise my voice when speaking to the boyfriend even when sitting right next to him there...Hahaha!It's best to make reservations ahead of time here because it can be really busy on weekends including Friday.",92802

Waiters which I can't remember her name was friendly and fast took our drink orders almost right away. Not a good start  since my drink had  lipstick on my wine glass, immediately sent it back. Appreciated the waitress not having an attitude about it when bringing a new one. Started with spring rolls and lettuce wraps, plenty for two people. Like dummies we both ordered entries , which was such a waste. Honestly just one entree was enough to share, even if you're both big eaters. I ordered ginger chicken and broccoli and rice. We were enjoying the quiet outside area and ordered 3 rounds of drinks:) we then indulged with a chocolate wall dessert, perfect for two to share. The manager came over to say hello , think his name was Demetry or Darius- I'm horrible with names, but he noticed our table was wobbly and took care of it right away. Next time I'm there for a conference , we'll be back for lunch.",92802

We got up and asked a server if someone was coming. Our server came and said she just clocked in. Huh? Ten minutes later, a different server came and said she's taking over because the other one was going on break. Huh? Thought she just clocked in? Anyhow, ordered happy hour drinks. Two came and the rest didn't. Our server said sorry, there's only one bartender. The bar was full and the restaurant was filling up. Who scheduled only one bartender? If I was the manager, I would get back there and start making drinks. The drinks took forever for the rest of the night. At one point our waitresss forgot about my husband's drink and disappeared forever. The original server came back and things got back on track but we were done eating. This was the worst service we've had at this restaurant. We were celebrating a Birthday and our son was home from the Navy. It was not a memorable night. Definitely not coming back.",92802

My iced tea was refilled every time I had about 1/3 left without me asking. Dirty plates were removed promptly and replaced with clean ones. The whole experience was great!

I like the modern look of the restaurant, it was very pleasant. Our waitress was the best I have experienced at any PFs.

The second time I went was with my mom for our girls weekend. We were greeted quickly and were ready to be seated but my mom requested a booth so the hostess was more than willing to accommodate us as long as we didn't mind waiting. We never mind hahaOur server was Garth and he was perfect and hilarious. Could not have asked for a more perfect server for our last meal before my mom went back home. We ordered the sweet ginger peach tea (our favorite) and Garth went the extra mile to tell us to let it steep for another two minutes. Nice touch. Chicken lettuce wraps are a must! Again Garth was on top of it and brought out more lettuce after we had eaten the first four lettuce leaves. He brought out two, just enough for each of us to eat what was barely left. He didn't over do it by wasting the lettuce leaves. Great observation to detail I love love love the steamed shrimp dumplings that chang's offers. Total must when I go. They were much more delicious than I remembered. We had orange peel shrimp and Mongolian beef with white rice. And of course, dessert consisted of the delicious banana spring rolls! (drool)My mom and I had a great time and Garth was an excellent server. It was a very relaxing, filling and just fun meal to share. Garth was also awesome enough to find me before we left to return my sunglasses to me. He came up to me as I was sitting, waiting for my mom on a bench (still in the restaurant) and says ""I don't think you're going anywhere!"" I look up and there he is wearing my sunglasses. Too much fun! So thank you so much Garth for adding to our girls weekend. And thank you pf chang's for your excellent food and staff!",92802

We waited 15 minutes for a server to come over to us and ask us if we've been helped, we said no. She never came back. Our actual server arrived 10 minutes after that to ask for our drink order. My husband and I ordered a bottle of wine listed on the menu. About 10 minutes later she comes back and let's us know they don't have that wine. I ordered a glass of another wine (my husband was over it), we put in our food order also. We received our food about 20 minutes later, still no wine. As we were about half way done my glass of wine finally comes. Food was a C-, lacking flavor, cold, nothing special.On top of that, our section was completely empty and the wait in the lobby and outside was unbelievable. We heard about 3 separate families walking to the bar/bathroom saying things like why are we waiting so long, all these tables are open. It was super awkward because at this point we were the only two in this huge section and so many people wanting to just sit down! All in all, we won't be coming back.

All four of them faced the back wall, and not the front entrance.  Unbelievable.  I have been in the restaurant business for many years, and the management at this location sure hasn't taught their staff much about customer experience or appreciation.  This may be one of the worst restaurant experiences I ever have had.  Can't blame it on being busy either.  The four ""hostesses"" had a lot of time to face the back wall and chat amongst themselves.  I finally flagged down ANOTHER employee walking by and asked them to help me with my to go order.  At least she genuinely seemed to want to help, but she disappeared into the kitchen and didn't come back.  I seriously thought I was getting punked at this point.  This was not really happening at one of my favorite restaurants!  Next, I stopped ANOTHER staff to ask him for help and he finally got ANOTHER person who was actually able to walk behind the to go counter and grab my bag that had been sitting there the whole time.  And if the entire pick up experience wasn't bad enough,  the girl who rang me up and hastily bagged the plastic ware, etc obviously didn't read my order because I ordered plates that were not in the bag, and was given spicy sauces when I did not ask for any.  Did you catch that I had to go through talking to someone FIVE times and then got my food?!!!  If I cared to ever come back to this location, I would've asked to see the manager, but I really didn't care to spend another minute in there.   Really unimpressed by their lack of care, training, and management.  Will stick with my favorite P.F. Chang's in La Jolla, and just stick with going to CPK when I am in Anaheim (next door to this worst P.F. Chang's).",92802

I called an hour before leaving my house and drove about 30 minutes to come eat and drink for the happy hour I was told was going on. I was told 3 to 7 and 9 to 11. So I come in with friends and get situated on the patio where our server informs us happy hour was not happening. Then informs us that it's only happening in the bar area. The bar has no tables. Sitting side by side with several friends makes a hard conversation so I spoke with a supervisor to see if it could be considered as I was not informed of this when I called. I was dismissed and needless to say felt extremely frustrated. I will not be returning. You offer happy hour but only in one section of your restraunt. If someone is still coming to your establishment to spend money I don't think this should be an issue.,92802
2986,"321 W Katella Ave Ste 120 Anaheim, CA 92802",Lee Anne P.,"Westminster, CA",11/10/2016,2,A place to hang out but not for good Food. They tasted very salty and greased not good for someone's have a high blood pressure . Make sure check your ordered when they bring the food out  . We ordered 1 place they brought out the food we didn't ordered and not even offer to switch . Never come back there ....,92802
2987,"321 W Katella Ave Ste 120 Anaheim, CA 92802",Cheryl S.,"Anaheim, CA",10/25/2015,2,"I have been looking forward to going to this restaurant for quite a while. I always heard good things. I have to say I was extremely disappointed. After we arrived the waitress brought our appetizer plates. my boyfriend noticed that his plate had previous food on it then when I checked my plate I noticed it was dirty as well. Not off to a good start. Anyhow the appetizers came which were very tasty, we got steamed edamame and egg rolls. However our dinner took an extremely long amount of time to arrive. My son had drank 4 sodas while we were waiting for dinner and I asked for water and it took me about 10 minutes to get the glass. once dinner arrived we were happy. my dish unfortunately was not that great, I got the kung pao chicken which was very dry. My boyfriend got the cashew chicken which was really good and my son ordered the honey shrimp which was delicious. Anyhow after you're done eating we had been there nearly an hour and 35 minutes. I was so ready to go it was getting late. We asked for the check and waited about 10 more minutes and I finally had to go ask the hostess to get our waitress. By the time she finally arrived with our bill then came back to give us our card back we had been at this restaurant for 2 hours just for a regular dinner. That does not include the 30 minutes we waited to be seated. I don't know if the service and everything was bad because of its location. But I can say I will not be going to PF Changs again. I have to admit I enjoyed Panda Express more . plus it's alot cheaper to go to Panda Express for good food then it is to pay $95 and have a horrible experience at p.f Chang's.",92802

I had the Kung Pao Shrimp,  it was so salty . The breading was soggy not crispy like fresh breading should be . You can tell it was frozen shrimp. My friend got the Lo Mein it wasn't anything special we would of rather gone to our local Chinese food spot . Oh and there is nothing cool about the coconut cooler.  Waiter was nice you can tell he has had unsatisfied customers before.

F. Chang fried rice with Shrimp.  The place is very noisy.All the food was very good.  The food was promptly served and hot.  I even ate it with chop sticks.Our server was Franky.  He did a good job.,92802
2993,"321 W Katella Ave Ste 120 Anaheim, CA 92802",Shawn D.,"Fullerton, CA",1/5/2013,4,"This would mark the first time EVER, that I would eat here.First impressions are everything and my first impression of this place was that it was very nice inside and the staff, right away, cheery and ready to serve, were upbeat and smiling. Very cool. Everyone here genuinely seemed to enjoy where they worked and what they did.The waitress had brought a plate with little cups (porcelain) with different types of dipping sauces in them. One was red (Chili paste), the other was what looked like a soy sauce consistency but with what appeared to be diced little chives in them, and the other was what I THOUGHT to be Honey Mustard. Boyyyy, was I ever wrong. I first took a dab into the yellow one, thinking it was good ol' honey mustard. The instant it hit the back of my palette and down my throat, all I knew was it was in fact Wasabi Honey Mustard (at least it tasted like Wasabi) and it burrrned. Don't get me wrong, I like my wasabi on sushi (tiny dabs when combined in soy sauce and ginger slices) but this was just crazy spicy. Anyway, not to drag on about that but it was a funny moment at the table. I think my facial reaction was prices less, judging by everyone laughing and giggling.We started off with Egg Flour Soup, which is always a choice of mine when deciding on Asian soups. IT was great! Not too hot and just the right start to the upcoming appetizers and entree.Then it was onto the Appetizer. The Crab Wontons. Very good and it came with Plum Sauce (another favorite of dipping sauces) and I have nothing but good things to say about how it started out with the food and these things were Suh-weet!For my Entree, I went ahead and had Kung Pao Chicken. For some reason lateley, I've been in the mood for some spicy foods. Don't ask me why. But it wasn't too bad and the portions were just right enough to where I didn't feel too stuffed, but yet, satisfied without the feeling of ""wanting more"".Finally, finshed off with dessert ofcourse. I chose the Chocolate Peanut Butter Crunch treat. Dude, it tasted just like a cross between a Snickers and a Kit-Kat maybe. More Snickers than Kat, but it was a decent sized slice and it left me feeling satisfied, both on the taste buds and as well as the stomach. Our Waitress was great! I wish I could remember her name, but she reminded me of a young Kate Beckingsale ;-) and she was quite pleasing to say the least.Anywho, afterward I ended lunch with a nice walk through the Garden Walk Plaza, which consisted of a few stores, one being O'neill and a candy store (which is a big plus!) and then that was all she wrote!P.F. Chang's China Bistro, or more like Pretty Fabuloso Chang's China Bistro is a perfect dining place for some good Asian Eatery.Check it out, the locations are pretty spread out through SoCal, so find the one nearest you and go have a Wonton! Or have a ball...or yeah...you know what I mean.",92802
2994,"321 W Katella Ave Ste 120 Anaheim, CA 92802",Amy S.,"Brea, CA",10/25/2015,5,First time going to PFC's tonight. We had great service and the food was awesome! Definitely will be coming back.,92802
2995,"321 W Katella Ave Ste 120 Anaheim, CA 92802",Aaron D.,"Anaheim, CA",2/11/2009,5,"So, a lot of different ways of looking at Chang's. I do really enjoy sitting outside on their patio and having some food and drinks. They have a real nice patio and they have good quality heaters when they have them on. They have some delicious mixed drinks. And the tropical iced tea is pretty nice as well. So, as far as updates - I am bored with their sauce. They need to come up with some more inventive ways of interesting me sauce wise. It was cool that they make custom pot sticker sauce the first few times I went there - but they need to graduate beyond that at some point. Otherwise they will just continue only interesting new customers and repeats will eventually become bored and move on. If there was a PF Chang's in my hometown growing up I would have loved it. But, when its sitting across from McCormick and Schmick's, Roy's Hawaiin Fusion, and down from the Cheesecake Factory they really need to pick it up a notch. Also, as I have recently read their nutritional information and realized that most of their dishes are a heart attack waiting to happen I have been a bit less enthused. Even the coconut curry vegetables was outrageously full of calories and fat. This is a disturbing fact. The Great Wall of Chocolate(read piece of chocolate cake) has over 2000 calories and over 90 grams of Fat. I mean - I recognize eating chocolate cake is not like eating a raw carrot - but these numbers are outlandish. Any idiot can make food taste good if they are allowed to use enough fat, sugar, and grease. The upside is that they can change the way they make lots of their entrees if you ask. You can ask for low sodium, less oil, no oil, etc. The point is - they should have a variety of items on their menu that are trying to clog my arteries. I should have some random ability to order a few things that aren't outrageously bad for me. So, Chang's no longer gets a 5 from me. They may not have deserved it anyway. I do love the setting. I do really like the location. The food is tasty. But, its awful for you. See this guide from Chang'spfchangs.com/pdfs/nutrit…It will spell out the craziness for you if my words were not enough.",92802

2997,"321 W Katella Ave Ste 120 Anaheim, CA 92802",David A.,"San Francisco, CA",12/28/2013,1,"The meal was decent but service was terrible.  This could be because we were a relatively large group a few days after Christmas.  Waiter lost my validated parking ticket and told me he handed to me, indicating I lost it.  Only after asking the Manager to look a little harder did he find it. Food was OK - suped up and regular old Chinese restaurant food - but no way worth the premium. For the price, you expect either wonderful food or good service.  Here there is neither.",92802

We were down in Anaheim for our Disneyland vacation and the same day we arrived, we walked over for an early dinner. It was not busy at all and got seated right away. Soon after the waitress finished taking our order, another waiter walked up to our table and gave us a free order of lettuce wraps. He said he knew we didn't order it-but the kitchen ended up making an extra one so we could have it. I was delighted since I love the lettuce wraps--but after the first bite-I realized it was waaaay too salty. I order the Chang's spicy chicken--which was cold. My hubby had the Vietnamese salad and the noodles were RAW. When we told the waitress--she said they were al-dente. But no--the noodles were raw- my husband is Vietnamese and we eat vermicelli noodles all the time. He couldn't finish his meal and sufficed his appetite with a few more bites of the salty lettuce wraps before just downing his beer and waited for us to finish. I noticed my son was just picking at his food as well-which is odd for him-coz he's a teenage boy with a huge appetite. After tasting his broccoli beef plate I found out his plate was really salty as well. So it seems the cook(s) are a big heavy handed with the soy sauce! For the  price we paid for the lack of quality-We will not be coming back.",92802

Unfortunately their chicken noodle soup didn't come with the normal pi rice noodles. That was the only bummer of the night. I get that every time I come here. The asparagus is always great and another thing I always get. I loved the double pan fried noodles and the Mongolian beef. I always order too much so I can have left overs.

Didn't mind it, we kicked it at the bar and drank a few Kirins. We got to our table after having a couple beers each and ordered our food. Service was kind of slow but the waiter said they were sorry and their computers went down. At the end, we were waiting for our desserts but just had to leave. We were going to the Ultra Heat Lounge at 9pm. We walked up to the front desk and asked to pay and that we had to go. The manager said they were sorry for the delays and said our dinner was on them!

Was with 5 others and it took a bit of time for the waiter to come around and take our order.   We sat for about 15 minutes just waiting for that to happen.   Once our order was taken, the waiter comes back 5 minutes later and asks 2 people in our party what they ordered because he couldn't figure out what he wrote down.   Then about 30 minutes later our appetizers start to come out.   Only 5 minutes after that our dinner comes out too.   The timing was clearly off with either the kitchen or our waiter.   One person in our party was never given their food though.   They of course told us to eat and we proceeded to do so.  The waiter tells us it will be out soon. 10 minutes go by and still nothing has come back for our friend.  Once it eventually does come, it's not even correct.    The waiter says he'll go correct it... The problem though now is we all have to get to our movie in about 10minutes or so.   Our friend tells the waiter don't worry about it and we just need the check.   The food the rest of us got was totally bland.   A very unfortunate experience here.   The one bright spot was that the manager was completely professional and takes care of our check.   This would be a one star if not for her pleasant professionalism.    Thank you to her but I hope if you decide to go here that the waiter is gone.",92802

We sat inside, and it was just a little too loud inside, but that's probably just me being a grandma. Our server was super friendly and helpful. I don't go to P.F.  Chang's often, so she was helpful when we asked for her recommendations. We got the 2 for 40 deal, which was plenty of food. For the entree, we got the kung pao chicken, which we both really liked, and the Beef a la Sichuan, which we both hated. The beef was SUPER dry. I didn't eat much of that, and I would def not recommend ordering anything steak related there (maybe this obvious, considering it's Asian food). The food was also REALLY salty overall. Overall, it's what you expect for the chain, and since we had a gift card it was fun and worth it, but I don't think I would really go back..maybe for happy hour or something.",92802

Chang's.Yes, we came here with a large party, but I have been to other places with large parties, and they have delivered in spades.  Not so much here.  1.  They seated the wrong group at our tables.  When we asked them, they went and checked, and confirmed that we were to be seated outside.  We then sat outside, and about 5 minutes later, we were told that we were in fact to be seated inside.  This is a forgivable mistake given that our parties were about the same size (if this was the only mistake).2.  Service was extremely sluggish.  Yes it was a large party, but the restaurant wasn't terribly slammed, and they should be used to this kind of thing.  Our drinks were not refilled that often, the clearing and adding of plates was incredibly awkward, and after our dinner course (we ordered the 4 course prix-fixe), they waited another 10-15 minutes to take our desert order (should have taken it in the beginning), and then it took ANOTHER 20 MINUTES for it to come out.  It was so bad that I asked for it to be boxed up the second it came out.  3.  The food was TERRIBLE.  Seriously, I enjoy the food at Panda Express much better.  Our ""Sichuan"" beef was more like a beef jerky, our honey chicken was bland and lacking any depth, and our wontons were just deep fried with nothing to them at all.  There was not a single thing that stuck out for me at all.  The only redeeming thing was that they split up our checks into smaller portions, making the bill easier to pay.  That's the only thing I like about the meal.  I will never come back.1 star.",92802

We paid $50 more than we wanted to on our $70 bill. We will not be coming back to PF Changs. No sir! The only positive was the outdoor setting was nice and her cucumber/strawberry lemonade was really good. Other than that, don't waste the money on just an ""Ok"" meal that's twice the price.",92802

It was kind of like it didn't even have a flavor at all. I left feeling dissatisfied with the whole experience and honestly I don't think I'll ever dine at another PF Changs again.

3036,"321 W Katella Ave Ste 120 Anaheim, CA 92802",Crystal C.,"Bellingham, WA",12/30/2014,2,"Okay, 2 and a half maybe. We went here purely because we were given a gift card for Christmas. We were quoted a 15-20 minute wait for 2 at around 5:20. We were seated at around 6:00. The interior is nice but there appears to be a lot of tables that remain open while people are being quoted close to an hour wait. This could be because of reservations or trying not to slam the servers with so many tables at once, but it seemed odd how many available tables there were. We were greeted pretty quickly and ordered drinks and an appetizer right away. About 10 minutes later we ordered a couple of dishes to share. Shortly thereafter the main entrees showed up, and we never received our appetizer. The food runner didn't apologize but asked if he could just leave our food with us and he would check on the appetizer. We told him to forget about the appetizer and to ask our server to remove it from the bill. When the server eventually came back he told us he had been in the back waiting for the appetizer. I have serving experience so I know that you shouldn't send main entrees to the kitchen when a table hasn't even received their appetizer, especially if you know the entrees won't take long at all. To the credit of our server he did come back some time later to ask if we wanted the appetizer anyway despite it having been taken off the bill already. Chang's fried rice: it was good, typical fried rice, can't really go wrong with fried rice.Moo Goo Gai Pan: this dish was aesthetically beautiful but lacked flavor and was very bland. I took it home and sautéed it with some jalapeño olive oil and a few spices and this made a HUGE difference. Overall, I'm a much bigger fan of a more authentic Chinese place and cuisine. For being a corporate chain I expected a lot friendlier and more attentive staff. I don't think I saw a single staff member here smile once. Maybe it's because they turn so much business based on location that they don't feel they need to ultimately provide much customer service, but I can say it's unlikely that I would ever come back here unless we were given another gift card. Even then I would consider letting someone buy it off me for a little less than face value.",92802

Haven't been to PF Chang's in ages so looked forward to some good Americanized Chinese cuisine. This place is pretty huge. Nice, woody décor with warm interior ambience. We started with crispy green beans as an appetizer. Highly recommended. The green beans were light and crispy on the outside yet crisp and fresh on the inside. The dipping sauce was killer! I enjoyed the garlic noodles: simple, slightly garlicky and sweet. My wife thought it was too sweet though. The veggie lo mein was also very good. The noodles were kinda sticky but the overall flavors were very good. The pepper steak was basically flank steak with bell peppers and onions in a garlicky  sauce. It was alright. Nothing special. The sweet and sour chicken was disappointing. The chicken was cooked alright but the sauce overwhelmed it. Way too thick, sweet and tangy. Our server performed her job well. She was attentive and got what we needed. So in the end, I got my PF Chang's fix. Overall, I would give this place 3.5 stars.",92802

Dan Dan noodles were so overcooked that they were completely stuck together in a sort of mush. To be fair, the chicken in black bean sauce that my gf ordered was excellent.I sent back the two failed dishes and they replaced them, I actually didn't want them any more but was not given that option.Charged full price for everything, manager gave me a free appetiser for next time - wow how lame",92802

Chang's?  Chain restaurant - from California to Cheektowaga, they're all about the same.  Modern, fashionable interior styling and the knack for taking dishes that you would normally find on a buffet table for $10 all-you-can-eat, improving on them slightly and charging $15.Hey, it is what it is.  But if you want a good East-West fusion and a comfortable dining experience, without having to serve yourself past a sneeze guard, then P.F. Chang's is always a good choice.I ordered the Kung Pow Chicken and some spring rolls.  My colleagues ordered the lettuce wraps and Crispy Honey chicken.  The food was good, it was served relatively quickly - a great feature for hitting any restaurant on a business lunch, knowing you won't be there for 40 minutes waiting to get your order - and the wait staff was friendly, accommodating and very attentive.But alas, it is a chain.  I can't see giving chains more than 3-stars in most cases since they all lack originality and home-town style.  But this location definitely earned full marks and well deserved 3-stars.",92802

We ate here on Saturday and Sunday night as we had gift cards for here and it wouldn't cost us extra.  I will say, please book a reservation if you decide to come ahead of time as they book quite fast and you can be left waiting for a long time.Sat. 3/21/2015 We ordered a coffee (disneyland took alot out of my boyfriend) and a Coconut cooler (was so good and refreshing!! but ask for light ice as they filled it up with a bunch of ice and not a lot of drink). Both were refreshing plus two waters. We got the chicken lettuce wraps which were so good!! as our appetizer. Our main course of chicken fried rice was decent, it was slightly overcooked and a tad bit mushy, but our other dish orange peel beef absolutely had no flavor which was disappointing!! Our waiter was nice, but not attentive as it was busy which was okay. Sun. 3/22/2015 We came back, my boyfriend ordered the pear mojito which was very tastey but had too much alcohol for my liking. I got again the coconut cooler with light ice. This time we got the Prefixed pairing for 2 as we thought it would save us some money with the gift cards and of course it was more expensive then the night before. So, this came with an appetizer, a soup, 2 main courses and a dessert. I got the won ton soup and he got the hot and sour soup. Mine was so bland and inedible to eat and his was so jell-o-y like that he couldnt eat it either. We just ate our appetizer, the chicken lettuce wraps, which were just okay, better the night before. We got chicken lo-mein which was decent and we got sweet and sour chicken which was so bland and almost to the point of being inedible. Since dessert came with our dinner, we had a choice of Rasberry chocolate wontons or vanilla bean wontons. We opted for the vanilla bean wontons since it had the rasberry sauce and chocolate sauce on it as well. It was absoluting horrible. My boyfriend didnt mind it but definitely not something he would ever order again. Also, this was suppose to save us money, but it actually costed us $10 more than the previous night, which was fine since we had gift cards but outrageous at the same time when we think about it. My boyfriend and I decided that PF changs is not good and we wont be back, but since we have gift cards, we will use them up by having drinks and since the one local to us has good dessert, we will go for dessert as well.

Placed our ordered, the new lobster roll, mongolian beef, Pad Thai chicken, chicken fried rice, and spicy chicken.....all was amazing one of the best meals we had in years. The atmosphere, the service and the food has 5 starts. Thank you for a great date night and a great meal....we are so so stuffed!!! Can't sit to eat the leftovers tomorrow!!! Will be back soon!!",92802
3072,"321 W Katella Ave Ste 120 Anaheim, CA 92802",Keziah M.,"Orange, CA",7/6/2016,1,"So I think my temper was definitely more hot than the food tonight. I'm not a huge fan of this place to begin with but I live close by so what the heck. Started off with some drinks for happy hour. I'm a very observant person and the last thing I want is to be served food and beverage in/on dirty dishes. My drink was served in a dirty glass and I noticed right away. Told the bartender Samantha who turned around and poured the dirty drink from the dirty glass into another glass. I'm not one to waste alcohol so I let that slide. Me and my sister finished our drinks right away and I'm pretty sure there was at least 10 or 15 minutes left of happy hour. The bar wasn't full at all but someone(a gentleman)had Samantha's attention for quite some time while I sat with no drink. Amazingly enough she finally looked my way and then I was able to get more drinks. Missed happy hour price so of course not happy about that.Food came and it was not hot. Our noodles were actually cold. Very bad! I was hungry so I ate. I hate to complain because I've had my time in food service so I know the struggle but when I observe carelessness and laziness, I draw the line. As I'm eating, I see the bartender(yes, same one)pour champagne in a glass a take a napkin to the rim of the glass. Don't even want to imagine what she was wiping off. When I get the check I almost lose it because it was exactly what I expected and I'm very frustrated by that. Of course one of my drinks was charged regular price and both of my sisters drinks didn't even make it on happy hour. I'm totally done with Samantha so when I can finally get someone's attention I request a manager. Guess word gets to Samantha that the black chick requested a manager so she feels the need to come and try to correct herself and give me attitude. Sorry but being busy or anything else you feel you are, gives you no right to be rude to a customer or make excuses for you being a horrible bartender/server! Speak to Ruben who comps the cold noodles and revises the check. Sat and ate the desert that came with the meal while the bar completely clears out. Guess Samantha is too busy being consoled by two coworkers to notice me waving my freaking arm at the end of the bar to cash me out so I get the heck out of that dump. At this point I feel like a cartoon character with steam coming out of my ears. I blaze down to the front with check in hand to meet Ruben again who's in a state of complete shock to see me with the check. Ruben is fabulous and shows much better character then the immature rats at the bar and offers to comp the entire meal. I just want to pay for what I ate and leave and I tell him as much. We go back and forth and he caves and takes my money. I told him I'm completely disgusted with the place when he offers me a gift card. No way I'm going back there. I will give the only star here to Ruben for knowing how to do his job. Hopefully he can teach something to his team about providing quality customer service.",92802

I'm not sure why we decided of all places to go to PF Changs for quick and easy food, but that's how it worked out. Our waiter, Lucas, told us that it was highly unlikely that we would be getting our food on time. Apparently we weren't thinking clearly and ordered food anyways. He was very accommodating and tried to bring out our food asap. Honestly I have never had anything I didn't like  at a PF Chang's, my only qualm it is usually pretty crowded, but then that is a sign that the food is good right?",92802

If you are planning to go, I would strongly suggest that you make reservations. Also, if you are going at this time, be prepared to talk loudly with your party. There is little in the way to break up the noise if you are sitting inside, so it is super loud. We had a table of eight, and I could not hear the people not sitting directly across or next to me. That aside, the food here is actually pretty good. No, it's not authentic Chinese, it is very much a chain restaurant, but it is usually flavorful and I leave satisfied. The service staff is good, keeping drink glasses full, offering recommendations, etc. Beyond the restaurants along Katella, the Garden Walk is pretty run down. The only other things worth going to are the movie theater where you can pick you own seats and the candy shop.",92802

Changs.  I kind of have to.  It's been a family favorite ever since the first one was built at fashion island.  I am addicted to their chicken lettuce wraps.  Hi my name is Katie and I'm an addict.""Hi Katie""I could eat these every day of my life.  This is the only application of iceberg lettuce I can tolerate and for some reason they always have the freshest lettuce.  What's even better is the sauce they make for you.  I have been known on occasion to drink this straight from the container, I'm dead serious, it's that good.  Have them mix it up spicy and then add some more chili paste to your lettuce wrap and you are set.  Yummy. Now as far as the entrees go I usually go for their prefix menu and add on some Lo Mein.  I like lots of combos.  Mongolian beef, sesame chicken, crispy honey chicken, beef a la sichuan, kung pao scallops there are some decent choices.  Now remember this, when you go order a side of the sichuan style asparagus they are beyond tasty.  One of my favorite things to do is to pair these spicy veggies with the sometimes overly sweet Mongolian beef-perfect combo, they really should just wok it up together.Service is usually pretty good, I think the wait staff is kind of useless here besides refills, you do everything on your own.  But as long as my China mist iced tea is refilled I am a happy camper(I really like their iced tea choices too!)Now don't waste your time with the single serve desserts they taste like refrigerator to me.  I prefer the chocolate dome or the banana spring rolls, both are a pleasant and welcomed surprise form the usual frozen and plated desserts most chain locations offer.(remember i said I worked at a steakhouse, which is still around and kicking, none of desserts were made in house most of the time we had to chisel away freezer burn and cover it in chocolate fudge.)  All in all I like it and I'm happy to receive gift cards here or meet friends for a meal.",92802

I was surprised at how small the entree was.  I've eaten at PF Chang's before (different locations) and remember having better food and service.  I tip well (normally over 20%) even with mediocre service but didn't feel bad about a 15% tip here.  I very rarely tip below 20%...but this waiter had better things to do than provide us with good service.  I understand being busy but he could have checked up on us now and then.,92802

Chang's for a long while now.  For Christmas this past weekend, a friend gave my husband and I a $25 gift card, and with that it was off to the Anaheim Garden Walk for a long awaited meal.  Atmosphere:  The night started out great.  The wait was 2 hours, but since we were a party of two, we came just in time to get seated immediately.  We were seated outside and it was great.  The inside was a bit crowded and noisy, but the patio had a relaxed atmosphere and although it was a chillier winter night, the overhead heaters made up for it.  Everything was cute and classy.  The Garden Walk is always a nice place to spend an evening.  We also had a bit of an unintended show as a balloon animal artist set up on the other side of the glass and was making some elaborate shapes.  The restaurant was planned well so the tables seemed spaced a nice distance from each other.  Food:  We ordered the Prix Fixe dinner for two:Soup:  I got the hot and sour soup and my husband ordered the egg drop soup.  His was more savory- almost like a chickenless chicken noodle flavor.  The hot and sour was tangy with flavorful tofu.  Unlike some restaurants, the soups were not too heavy so they don't fill you up before the main course, which is refreshing.Appetizer:  My husband begged me to get the salt and pepper calamari (I really wanted the lettuce wraps).  It was decent.  The salt and pepper mix was served on the side along with a sweet tangy sauce instead of your typical tomato base.  The calamari wasn't greasy- which I liked- but wasn't particularly unique. Entrees:  Kung Pao Shrimp & Chang's Spicy Chicken.  The Chang's Spicy Chicken wasn't very spicy.  Everything about this restaurant is definitely Americanized.  The foods are definitely salty and devoid of heat (Chang's ""House Sauce"" was basically flavorless oil, watered down wasabe, and chili sauce).  I wasn't impressed with the Chang's chicken and agree with other reviews about it being comparable to Panda Express.  I did like the Kung Pao Shrimp.  It was salty, but the shrimp was cooked perfectly and I liked the seasonings.  It could have had more heat (I ate the chilies served with it which helped).Dessert:  My husband ordered the Tiramisu and I ordered the Mini Triple Chocolate Mousse.  We shared them so we could try both.  I'm not a Tiramisu fan, but P.F. Chang's was really good.  I loved my mousse and the small sizes are perfect for a small treat after a large meal.Service:  Fantastic.  We were seated immediately- which started the whole night off great, had many servers refilling our drinks (they forgot once but immediately apologized) and our waitress was friendly, despite being clearly overworked.  She cleared our table quickly with each course and our food came right away.Conclusion:  Service and atmosphere are great.  Not super unique (it's reminiscent of Yard House for me), but nice.  The food and price, unfortunately, were underwhelming and will keep this from being a regular spot.",92802

We spend 35 bucks and feed the 2 of us, my daughter, and grandson. That's really good especially considering how good they are. The 4 star review instead of 5 is simply because the location verses the parking is bad. You can only park in the underground parking structure and have to pay. Besides that it's a great place.

The portions are very small and the food is overpriced. The flavor is there and the service is WAY better than a Chinese restaurant, but it's not the greatest Chinese food I've ever had.  When I went, it was my friend's birthday so we did the whole $25 per person with a family style meal and dessert for each person. There were like 20 of us, and it definitely did not feed all of us. Being polite, I didn't spoon half the food onto by plate, and sadly, it didn't fill me up. Their lettuce wraps are pretty good, but their fried rice was basically soy sauce and veggies.

She was prompt, attentive and took care of our group with a constant smile and even joked around with us, as we were quite chatty to her that night.  She really made us feel welcome and was truly loving her job. We later learned that she worked at a school during the conversation. Those children are in great hands.The hostess ( I forgot her name) was wonderful as well. The extra touch of the manager coming over and thanking us for dining at PF Chang's and asking about the service was excellent.We get to Anaheim often and will not hesitate to have a wonderful experience at Pf Chang's again.  Thanks Laynie for making a tough work week into a fun evening!Gary, Mae and Aric",92802

The food is absolutely amazing.  That said, I won't be going ever again because of the rude girls at the front desk. My friend had recently received a promotion and a group of 5 of us wanted to treat him to dinner. This is where he picked. I walked in and asked how long for a table of 5.  One of the girls said, ""Well its really busy. So it will be like a 2 hour wait at least.""  I stared at her, in shock.  I had never heard of that long of a wait. Yes the location is busy, yes it was a Friday night, but 2 hours?! Then I look around and see at least 3 tables open, and all of the patio open. So I inquired about the patio, stating that we didn't mind, and she snapped, ""No, it's not open. You have to wait 2 hours.""  I looked at my group and we all agreed we would try somewhere else, where the staff wasn't rude and they tried to be accommodating.  I told the girl at the desk, ""I'm sorry but nevermind. We are going to try to find some where else."" She got this smirk on her face and said okay. Then as we were walking out, she began speaking to another girl and laughing,  ""Can you believe that? They left because they believed the wait was 2 hours."" I was livid; I still am.In the age of customer service, I am so disappointed to have been treated like I was a piece of garbage that didn't matter.",92802

SUPERB service.  Our waiter (I wish I got his name) was very attentive and dealt with the requests of our large group (about 20 people) very well.  Gave good recommendations for drinks, kept my drink refilled, and overall was everything I love in a waiter, and I wish a waiter was.It was my friend's birthday, so we did this thing where we all put in $25, and had a 3 course meal served to us family style.  My favorite was the lettuce wraps.  Or maybe it was a tie.  A tie with their cute little desserts served in double shot glasses.  Our waitress (we had both a waiter AND a waitress) brought a sample set of these desserts to our table so we could get a visual of the desserts as we ordered.  I got the rasberry cheesecake.  I also tried the tiramisu (yum), chocolate mouse (YIKES - chocolate overload!), carrot cake, lemon pie, and red velvet cake.HOWEVER, I am Chinese, and I do need to bring up the fact that this place is just UBER Americanized, made to please the tastes of the masses, and not be true to the true to authentic chinese food.  The flavors and tastes just cannot compare to those found at an actual chinese restaurant.Thus, you can see my conflict in rating this place so high.  So I've reconciled it by saying that this review is 80% based on the amazing service I received the last time I ate at this establishment.  Great job!  I hope we left a decent tip!",92802

I've had better Americanized Chinese food at Panda express. The Buddha's feast was bland and the chow fun was overly spiced. The Ma Po Tofu was okay.

You know that the food is only going to be Americanized and sub-par, at best. You know that the food is also going to be overpriced. You know that the decor is going to be flashy and pretty, but more or less lacking-of-soul. BFD. If you don't like it, then take your happy ass somewhere else. If you didn't know, well, now you do. :) You're welcome. By all means, this does mean that you should avoid P.F. Chang's as a dining experience. Being apart of a chain of American-owned restaurants does have it's benefits. Cleanliness, for one. Okay, but anyway. The food isn't bad. I can honestly say that ordering a meal from P.F. Chang's will be better than nuking a Lean Cuisine Sweet and Sour Chicken meal. So that's an automatic win, right? I went with my friend Cyle, and he ordered the Chang's Spicy Chicken with a side of rice, while I opted for the Crispy Honey Chicken lunch special (entree, rice, soup o' choice). His chicken was better than my chicken, so I kept stealing his. ._. The plan was to box up half of our meals so that we would have dinner later that night, but it didn't work out that way. The serving sizes leaned towards the generous side, but we're lazy, so it was easier to keep eating rather than box up the food. Horrible, right? The Chang's Spicy Chicken (described as ""their version"" of General Tso's chicken and ""always a favorite"") was pretty decent. I've had General Tso's elsewhere in the city, and of course it's always going to be better from the divey hole-in-the-wall Chinese take-out place, but P.F.'s was more than merely edible. My Crispy Honey Chicken was not crispy at all, which was disappointing, and it was also rather bland, which I quickly got over by stealing more and more of Cyle's chicken. I wouldn't recommend it. I asked for salt, which apparently is a big ol' sin at P.F. Chang's. When I asked, the hostess said that she would have to go ask the Chef. WHAT? The look on my face must've been one of shock, because she hurriedly went on to explain that giving patrons salt was not traditional in Chinese cooking. I very desperately wanted to point that the restaurant wasn't traditionally Chinese anyway, so what was the big deal? Points to me, because I didn't say it. In the end, I got my salt. Damn skippy. Perhaps the greatest thing about P.F. Chang's were the dessert shots. I think they're actually called Mini Desserts, but they come in tiny little glasses and are $2 a pop, so Dessert Shots work for me. I got Red Velvet Cake, Cyle scored on Strawberry Cheesecake. Both were creamy and delicious (though the red velvet was waaaay better). They're tiny, but so cheap!...in comparison to the rest of the menu. I'd come back with a few friends for some kind of quirky dessert day. All in all, P.F. Chang's isn't a bad place to eat. You'll order food to fill your belly, and that's exactly what you'll get. It won't be anything spectacular, and your wallet will definitely be lighter. Take advantage of the experience and check out the rest of the shopping area while you're there, or Downtown Disney (super close by) if you want to make a night of it.",92802

I've been numerous times for their Happy Hour and am a consistent PF-X consumer. This drink is fabulous (although I cannot for the life of me remember WHAT is in it, exactly). It's on the fruity side, but is absolutely delish! Their agave margarita is also very, very good and not over-powering.The last time I went, I ordered their Singapore street noodles. Having had the REAL thing in Singapore, I was disappointed, but I'll still give them props for their effort. The noodles were a tad too soggy for my taste and it was a little bland, but it was still fairly good, nonetheless.We also order their tempura fried green beans, which are very good and my friend has also tried their stir-fried lamb with cilantro. I'm not a lamb fan at all, but the presentation of this particular dish was very, very good. It actually reminded me of a restaurant I went to in Beijing - major props to PFs! :D",92802

Cheng's has always been a favorite.  This location can get busy on the weekend, we prefer to go during lunch or happy hour.  My favorite touch is when the waiter creates a sauce for you, it makes any dish just a bit more delicious.  We tend to get the same dishes like the garlic chicken, the double pan-fried noodles; they come with white rice or brown rice. Definitely have the lettuce wraps!Happy hour is new.  I think it's from 3-6pm.  Beer specials and appetizers.  I loved the K-BBQ tacos.",92802

Yeah, I guess it's bad.So I went here for dinner, cuz it was my friend's birthday. Now I've been to PF Chang's before for another birthday, and it was pretty decent. This location was very nice, and I really liked the interior. The ambiance was mellow, and the service was great (especially since it was a big party)Now......for the food......I didn't find it too appetizing. My girlfriend and I ordered the orange chicken (Oh so authentic *sarcasm*) and the beef pepper steak. The beef pepper steak was a lot better than the orange chicken, but it still wasn't the business. I mean you don't really go to PF Chang's for authentic Chinese food....at least I hope not. Simply put: PF Chang's is Chinese food for a more Westernized palate. One thing that definitely stood out was their rice. It was pretty much like Uncle Ben's, I swear they cooked it straight from the box. I really wanted to enjoy the food, but it just wasn't cutting it for me. My review was based mainly on the food. Give it a try, you might find that you like it. As for me, I've had better.",92802

3171,"321 W Katella Ave Ste 120 Anaheim, CA 92802",Kecia W.,"La Mirada, CA",7/9/2014,3,"I feel like Yelp should split the stars into categories.  I love the food at this location, but I don't love the service here.No matter what time my husband and I have gone to eat at this place, it's taken more than an hour and a half.... Lunch or dinner, it doesn't matter.  Seems like they can't get you out of the building in an hour or less.  We've gone as late as 9:00 pm and didn't get out of the restaurant until almost 11pm!!!That being said, I have only ONCE had something I didn't care for.  It was actually 2 things we had in one night... 1.  The Singapore Street Noodles.  It was really bad.  The noodles were overcooked and super sticky. And it just had a strange flavor and  2. The Shaking Beef.... the beef was over cooked and the 'zesty' lime vinaigrette had too much lime.  It really made my mouth pucker and the flavor was overwhelming.However, if you start with the Chang's BBQ Spare Ribs and you won't be disappointed.  My husband LOVES these ribs and they give you a nice size serving, 6 decent sized ribs per order.  Plenty enough to be able to take some home for the next day.  My all time favorite thing here, is an odd choice, but it's the Chang's Chicken Noodle Soup.  Spicy an super flavorful.  The first time I had it , I was a little weirded out because the noodles are rice noodles and look strange.  But the broth is so tasty and has a great kick to it.  But if you don't like the kick, you can have it made to order without the heat.  We've done that a few times when we've had our 11  year old son with us because he doesn't like spicy.  It's still as delicious.  I order this often over the phone and bring it home and have it for a few days for lunch (take it to work).  I've found that if you leave it in the container provided, the noodles absorb the broth and it's ends up being a bunch of chicken and noodles.  I actually will spend the time and separate the broth (with a colander) from the chicken, mushrooms, cilantro and noodles.  This way, I have yummy soup for a few days and it stays in soup form!  It may seem like too much work, but you just can't bring this dish home without it losing all the broth to absorption. I adore the Kung Pao Scallops (this comes with peanuts, or rather it's supposed to come with them, I seem to always have to ask for a side of them AFTER the dish has arrived because there always is very little peanuts in it)  and the Beef A La Sichuan.... love too the Moo Goo Gai Pan (which is one of their kid friendly dishes... not a lot of seasoning, but still super yummy), you can't go wrong with the Mongolian Beef either.  We've never tried any dessert.One thing that kind of annoys me is when they bring you water, they all say to you, ""lets get you hydrated.""  It just sounds so cheesy and lame.  Just me I suppose.Most of the food is great, my husband and I normally try to mix it up some each time we go and try something we've never had before.  Sometimes it pays off, but other's it doesn't ... as with the night we ordered the 2 dishes mentioned above that we didn't care for.  That taught us a valuable lesson in that we only try ONE new dish when we go now.Enjoy your food, but be prepared to spend a long time there.",92802

The wait was not bad (about 20-30 min) considering it was a Saturday night, and there was a prom in town (so I heard). The waitress seated us as quickly as she could, and the place was really clean. Since my motto for Chinese food is ""the cheaper the more legit it is,"" this place doesn't fall in my target for ""good authentic Chinese food."" Its an Americanized bistro, for goodness sake. But taking that into account, the food was still pretty good, although it was really, really salty. I had some kind of lamb, and another person had the same entree, and we both agreed that a little less salt could've gone a long way.With all that said, I would probably give PF Chang's another shot if I were in search of pseudo-Chinese food.",92802

I usually like fake chinese food joints (i.e panda express) because they give you fortune cookies at the end, and perhaps better service sometimes (i.e. you won't see your bill laying on the table while you're still eating) BUT seriously PF Chang's, do you have to over season your food to the point it was almost unedible? :P The server was great. I left without taking my food (because it was salty) but it had already been boxed because the server  assumed that I'd want my leftover to go. It was a nice gesture but when I purposely forgot it at the table, she chased after me with my box of leftover ""Here you go, you forgot your food...."" lolEasy on the salt next time, will ya?",92802

We were sat on the patio in the farthest corner due to us having a party of 6, we were ignored for a good 20 minutes before our waitress came out. She had attitude and was kind of demanding when she spoke. One of our friends who was in our party didn't even receive his food until after we had finished eating ours. All in all it was a bad experience and coming from a parent who spends most nights in and who genuinely wanted to have an enjoyable time I was over it by the end of our dinner. Not to mention when our waitress brought out our desert, (we got the banana wonton desert) she laughed at the plate because the ice cream was running and said "" oh I made this plate first, do you want me to make you another or is this one okay"". If I was serving a guest and took too long to get there desert out, I'd make them another instead of bringing runny ice cream to there table.

I'm really glad we had a gift-card. We got the pre-fixe $40 for two... it came with:-- 2 soups: BF got hot & sour and said it tasted like a sauce for chicken, HAHA & I got Egg Drop which was decent...-- Appetizers: We got the Pork Steamed Dumplings which were pretty tasty... the wrap was a little too thick and it definitely was not screaming amazing, but was decent.-- Entrees: We got Honey Crispy chicken & Chang spicy chicken. The Honey Crispy chicken tasted a LOT better the Chang... The Chang wasn't even spicy! wth???-- Dessert: Choose two mini choosers from 8 and so we got the Red Velvet & Strawberry cheesecake. Both were rich, delicious & a perfect way to end the meal :)--*Not included in pre-fixe* I also got an Asian Pear Mojito.

We sat at the bar while we waited for our table of 4 and it didn't take too long. So what's wrong? Why the two measly stars for an established chain? Well PF Changs has REALLY salty food. Everything we tried was so salty. I tried smothering everything with rice and taking huge gulps of water to wash it down, but I will still remember how salty everything was. Is that what Americanized Chinese tastes like? Service was friendly, but incredibly slow. I think it took 10 minutes for our waiter to come back with our requested glasses of water. We were at our table for 2 hours...A meal shouldn't take that long unless you're sitting around and chatting it up.

The ultimate test of freshness is when you order the appetizer lettuce wraps and the lettuce is really clean and crisp. Pile on the chicken within the lettuce and add some sauce and you can taste the flavors. My girlfriend and I have a ritual of ordering the lettuce wraps (as do most others). I really enjoy the drink specials and menu because there are a lot of choices from beer to wine and a fair price. My ultimate goal is to try all the dishes because I've heard so much about the lamb, duck and noodle dishes being really exquisite. The fanciest entree I've eaten was the Sea Bass, which was so tender and full of flavor (not fishy!). All the shrimp dishes are great, especially if you like it spicy and full of flavor go for the Orange Peel with extra spice. The surrounding area of this restaurant always seems dead, which is sort of eerie. Very clean on the inside and outside and the staff are so polite and helpful. Double check when you check-in for promotions (food and drinks). One thing I noticed them promoting was the Dim Sum. I have taken a liking to ""Chinese Breakfast"" and have had it locally, but not from P.F. Chang's, which I am willing to try. One other thing, this location has a decent size bar and patio, which makes it really roomy in some sense. Great for big parties!",92802

Our waiter was incredibly helpful and checked in on us often. The hot and sour soup is incredible, order the large bowl if you have 3 or more people who want to share it. The chicken lettuce wraps are also an amazing appetizer and the crispy homey shrimp is the best entire by far.",92802
3203,"321 W Katella Ave Ste 120 Anaheim, CA 92802",Lon C.,"Pittsburg, CA",10/6/2014,1,My experience at this location was horrible. When I came in I was greeted by the host. I said I need a table for 1 and was told my best bet was the bar and pointed in the direction of the other side of the restaurant. I guess they don't want to give up their tables to single dinners. I headed to the bar and took a seat. The bar counter was covered with what looked to be sauce from the previous diner. I had to ask the bar tender to wipe off the counter. He did; however didn't bother to clean it all and left the counter sticky. The food was as good as always; however I won't be back to this location where single diners have to eat in the bar at dirty tables.,92802

The kung pao shrimp was like eating a salt lick. I'm pretty sure they used a whole bunch of salt to season the shrimp, THEN used a whole bunch of soy sauce at the end. It was extremely salty. The lettuce wraps were decent. And the Honey Chicken was decent also. But honestly, I could be more satisfied and save more money eating at Panda Express or other Chinese restaurants.",92802

The waiter mixed it up and cut the noodles into bit sized portions for me. My noodles were so damn salty! There was way too much sauce. I barely ate 1/4 of it. Bad choice I guess. The service was great though. I barely took 2 sips of my lemonade and the waitress brought out a refill!,92802
3208,"321 W Katella Ave Ste 120 Anaheim, CA 92802",Kimberly T.,"Huntington Beach, CA",9/19/2010,4,"I've been here twice, both times for a friends birthday, I have to say, my second experience was better than my first. The first time I went, our big party had to wait awhile, and the service was just okay. I mean, he was eye candy, but it was nothing memorable. I got the honey chicken with white rice, which was actually very good. I tried the orange, which I surprisingly didn't like, and believe me, I LOVE orange chicken. The only reason why my first trip wasn't amazing was because for some reason, the server charged me TWICE! And it wasn't like he swiped my card twice by accident, he charged me two different amounts. I had to go through the long wait of calling in and having the manager void one of the payments. I have to admit though, the manager made it very easy and was very understanding about it, leaving me in a better mood when I got off the phone.My second time around was better. Our server was really chill. We were waiting for one more person in our party so we can get seated, but she let us sit at the table early (which I think was really cool of her). We ordered the lettuce wraps while we waited (which were sooooo good). For my entree, I got the pan-fried noodles with calamari, and it was really good. The noodles were a bit saucy and tangy for my taste, but it was still really good. I tried my frend's honey shrimp with walnuts (or something similarly named), and it was AMAZING! The beef was really good, and their lo mein and fried rice were oh so good. While I originally would've rated this restaurant 2 stars, it has been upgraded to 4 because the food this time around and the service were really great. The only boo-boo (depending on how you look at it) was that their drinks weren't really that great. Lots of alcohol, but not so tasty (My friends got a cadillac margarita and a strawberry banana blended margarita. The alchohol was at the bottom of the blended, and both were just uber strong). All in all, pretty amazing. Before if someone were to have asked me to go to P.F. Changs, I would've been passive about it. But now, I have a stronger, more positive reaction to going to that restaurant.",92802

He stated after going through my gate in my apartment house, ""where do you want me to go now, I haven't got all night, either that or I'll just bring the food home and eat it all myself"" The manager at P.F. Chang's doesn't want to accommodate the handicapped. Told her I was unable to walk to the restaurant could they please send someone out to the car and take my order to which she replied, I can't just send my employees out aimlessly like that. I had my $100 I was going to pay for the food all ready, but had to drive away with nothing. She told me that there was another P.F. Chang's with curbside service in Irvine which is basically telling me to drive 25 miles out of my way and that there was nothing she could do to accommodate me. Just a little note to others who are handicapped and expect this company to help you out, nothing, NADA, don't expect Jack from this company.

3215,"321 W Katella Ave Ste 120 Anaheim, CA 92802",Adryenn A.,"Reno, NV",4/11/2010,2,"This review is limited to the reservation/wait list process.  First off, it should be known that I am a huge PF Changs fan, eat at one where ever I travel because I love the food, and the experience is always fantastic!This is the first time I've been not only disappointed in a PF Changs, but feel there is something significantly wrong with their front of the house operations that I've actually sent a letter to corporate!  I eat out at least 10 times a week, so naturally, as a foodie, I know how restaurants are run, and can recognize when they are run well or in the case, NOT!Attempt to eat there #1: estimated wait time 1 hour. Actual wait time 2 hours.  Of course at that point we went right across the way to eat at McCormick & Schmicks because there was immediate seating and fantastic food.  Upon comparing my usual PF Changs bill (I'm addicted to their pot stickers and back home I eat there multiple times a week) with what we spent at McCormick & Scmicks, we actually spent less for better food, spectacular service and no waiting.Attempt to eat there #2:  estimated wait time 20 minutes. At 21 minutes I check in to see how much long it's going to be...  another 30 minutes!!!I flipped open my OpenTable app on my iPhone and made reservations at McCormick & Scmicks again!  Time to be seated - none!I'm a huge huge huge fan of PF Changs food.  I suggest that corporate gets a trainer down here toot sweet to streamline what is clearly not a well working process of getting diners seated, and tables turned quickly.The other issue is that the staff have no ability to change the state of an angry or disgruntled customer, which admittedly, at the time they had to deal with me after waiting, I was. There was a distinct, ""Sorry we can't do anything about it, you'll just have to deal, cause we don't really care if you're upset."" attitude going on.Every customer should be treated like a regular, like a VIP, and here, they are treated more like cattle.  Maybe that's because it's right next to Disneyland and their clientele are transient, I don't know. I just know that out of the hundreds of times I've been to this chain in cities all over the country, this is the first time I didn't feel ""at home"".To end on a happier note: if this location is up to snuff in the kitchen (which I'll never know since I'll never go back) my favs are the potstickers. I take the flour wrapper off and just eat the inside!  My special sauce: take the pot sticker sauce, add a sugar packet, some hot mustard, and a drop or two of hot oil.  YUM!",92802

I arrived 20 min early to find a line that was three times as long as I've ever seen it. Again, given the holiday, I understood. The woman working the take out window showed little to no sense of urgency and did not communicate with the rest of us in line. After 25 minutes wait, it was now a few minutes after my food was to be ready and I finally made it to the register. She took payment and went to go ""check on"" my order. She came back to unapologetically inform me that my order was not ready. I finally received my food at 8:35. An additional 25 minutes longer and more than an hour after placing my order.

You expect consistency and if you like the establishment itself, reviews are left to service and location, both of which were great here! I was in town for a trade show and was riding solo for this one. When I noticed PF Chang's on the drive in, I immediately started my craving for the Veggie Lettuce Wraps. My issue with PFC's lettuce wraps is that once it's in my head, it's decided and done so that gave me something to look forward to if nothing else came up. I managed to beat the rush and had no trouble finding a single seat at the bar. The bartender was attentive and friendly as was the rest of the staff I had interactions with.

The front desk was also helpful and friendly.-Prices: On the higher side.-Atmosphere: Nice and cozy. The tables are a little small for sharing the food but it does make it more intimate.-Other Notes: This restaurant is close a few of the large hotels and within a large shopping area. You can walk to a few after dinner areas or so shopping before hand.

Main course was orange peel chicken, crispy honey shrimp and wok charred beef (which was the star as far as I was concerned). BUT--and take note P.F. Chang's--the music was SO LOUD you had a hard time talking/listening to your dinner companions. All I could think about was finishing and getting out of that noise!  We told the waitress and she said we weren't the first people that have complained (really?) but it was something they had no control over.

Back in October my boyfriend and I received excellent service from a waiter named Ruben. He was very friendly, courteous and attentive. He also gave my boyfriend a small complimentary serving of soup which they refer to as ""the ring of fire"", which he thought he might enjoy from some small talk they had. It was spicey! But a very nice gesture. The food was excellent as always.This review however is for a more recent visit. On 01/27/11, we went for my birthday, while visiting Disneyland. I had started my day off pretty crappy with terrible service over at the Jazz Kitchen Express in downtown Disney. However P.F. Chang's was able to  bring my satisfactory ratings of food/restaurant service, significantly higher for my special day again, especially being my 21st birthday, I ordered my first legal cocktail, the PF X, which was certainly strong but I suppose you get your money's worth. The waiter was kind enough to come back and mention to me that happy hour would be starting shortly and if I didn't mind he would put my drink order in momentarily so that I may save $3. Which may not be a lot to some people, but to me a savings is still money pocketed. We ordered and received our food shortly after, no surprise, P.F. Chang's, particularly this location, typically serves their guests in a timely and courteous manner, however the cook mistakenly doubled our order of spring rolls and received the extras free of charge. Another plus, which we have been quite lucky to be on the receiving end of multiple times at P.F. Chang's, we've received complimentary chicken fried rice which was mistakenly cooked before as well as dessert.After all that, the waiter, forgive me I don't recall your name!, exemplified his close attention to detail and recalled that he had noticed it was my birthday while carding me for my drink, he asked what kind of dessert I wanted and got it promptly then packed my 3 dumplings left over in a to go bag with both my sauces. Although my boyfriend and I both neglected to remember to give our warrior cards for our 10% discount, this was yet again another good experience at P.F. Chang's. In order to up the rating, I feel the entrees, however, need a little adjusting. We used to typically order the Beef ala Szechuan, unfortunately the last few times we've ordered this dish at numerous locations, the meat has been scarce and chewy. Other entrees just weren't that good. However I love the appetizers and small plates, such as the pork panfried dumplings, wonton soup, spicey green beans, and my boyfriend the spring rolls.

We are P.F. Chang regulars but this has to be the best location we have visited so far, mainly because of the service given by Ruben. He was friendly, attentive, and provided us with a free sampling! A bit spicy for our tastes but free is free. He also sent me off with a to-go cup for my diet coke. He should be waiter of the year for that act alone in my book. Pros: -Ruben          - Great location with parking validation          - Free sample of ""Ring of Fire""          - Diet Coke to go!          - Overall great service and pleasant experienceCons: - After effects of ""Ring of Fire""",92802

Garden Walk is still pretty quiet, despite its proximity to the horrors of Disney, and my party of six were seated in about five minutes. Our server was great and the food was decent (I had the egg rolls followed by the Honey Chicken). On the other hand, a large party of ladies seated behind us were making an unholy racket, singing (We Are Family....I'm not even kidding. I've seen people jailed for less) and shouting throughout much of our meal. And of course, nobody asked them to keep it down. Then they had run out of chocolate for dessert (that's another one that should result in jail time).Lastly, three of the six people in my party (including me) reported stomach upsets the next day. So...just go to Irvine. It's not that far a drive. And if you insist on going to Garden Walk, go to McCormick & Schmick's instead. That place rules.",92802

3247,"321 W Katella Ave Ste 120 Anaheim, CA 92802",Jonathan S.,"Enterprise, NV",1/17/2015,2,"Our experience at this PF Changs was awful. We waited a long time for our food, service was rude, orders came out at different times like CRAZY, and when they did they were wrong.  In the end the manager made our whole meal free which was great and the absolute best they could do, but it doesn't fix multiple employees being rude and food straight up not tasting good so we wont be back. After ordering it took like 45 minutes for the first appetizer to show up and only one came. 10 minutes later a couple more orders come and the guys brining them are totally impatient with us wanting to just slam it on the table and go. 10 minutes later a couple more orders come out and these guys are impatient too and they say the kitchen is behind. So we have one more guy who hasn't received his order and it gets to the point that we are all finished eating and he still doesn't have any of his food. We tell them and it turns out the server wrote down the wrong entree but they say they'll make the right one and let us know again that the kitchen is backed up. Everyone's done eating and that entree isn't coming for a while so we just tell them to forget about it. Then while we wait another long period of time for the check to come they bring out the food we said we didn't want. We don't take it because we are going to a movie and then the manager comes and after hearing us out once, leaving, and then coming back to hear us out again she comps the whole meal.  The food did not taste good. I had the lettuce wraps and the fried wontons. The wontons were just ok but very expensive, and the lettuce wraps were so off-putting I didn't even finish them.  In all honesty, the food is on par with Panda Express and Panda is a whole lot cheaper for more food. My experience may not be the norm but after similar experiences at other PF Changs locations, this one seals the deal that I wont be back ever again.",92802

The Garden Walk is a fun and busy place where you can find it packed with tourists any day of the week. You can choose to grab some food before or after watching one of the movies at their theaters or you can choose to go to Heat Ultra Lounge after eating.The only down side to visiting this location is the wait time if you show up anytime after 6:30pm or 7:00pm. But that's a great excuse grab some drinks at the bar to wait until your pager starts lighting up and flashing. There is something about alcohol in your system that makes Chinese food taste so much better!If you are looking for someplace with a lively atmosphere, then I recommend come here!",92802

Upon arrival we were told there would be a 20 minute wait, however we were seated in about 5-10 minutes so that was nice. The food was good as usual and the two star rating doesnt reflect the taste of the food. The service and time spent waiting are the reasons for the low score. The server gave my sister attitude from the start. My sister had a minor change to her order and he said he was unable to assist her with the change.  The food took a little longer than normal, however I dont blame this on the server. The kitchen was more than likely backed up as it was peak hours on a Sunday. He was fairly attentive during our visit and refilled our drinks and bussed the table regularly.It was up until this point that the rating would have been a 3 or 4. After this it went downhill and quick. Our meal came with a dessert, so we decided to upgrade and get the Apple Cobblers. We were waiting for about 15 minutes and the server told us that it would be a little longer because the only had one pastry chef on. We continued waiting and he came back 10 minutes later and told us it would be another few minutes. At this point in time we had been waiting for 25 minutes for our desserts so we were slightly bothered. He comes back after another 10 minutes and says that they are out of the dessert we ordered. We are pretty bothered at this point as we were waiting for over 30 minutes for literally nothing. Tables around us were seated, received there food and almost done with it in this time frame. He never once apologized for the wait, he just asked us what other dessert we wanted. I understand restaurants run out of items, however being told this after that long of a wait is unacceptable. We reluctantly told him that we want the basic dessert and we had that out in 5 minutes. The dessert was horrible and our table barely touched it. It then took him another 15 minutes to find a manager to adjust the bill to the new desserts. The server never once apologized nor got a manager involved. I have worked in the food service industry for over a decade and would never allow this to happen to my customers. My family contemplated talking to a manager about how the server handled the situation. We decided to bring it to their attention as we were upset as how we were treated. My sister talked to a manager, who was really nice and understanding. The manger gave us a gift card for them to make it up to us. I appreciate this and thought it was warranted in this situation. We will more than likely go back to use the gift card, however it will more than likely be at another location.",92802

Since it's a chain restaurant, it really has more to do with everything but the food. If you haven't been to a Changs yet, it's very solid American-style chinese food. I haven't had a plate there yet that I didn't like and they also have a lot of options for tea lovers, which I appreciate. I just wanted to give this particular Changs kudos for the great service I got there. My waiter Andrew was sharp, attentive, and friendly without being cloying and fake (like the waiter from Office Space). He was on top of my tea refills like a pro, which is 90% of how I judge any restaurant.If I had anything negative to say about this location, it's only that it can get very crowded and the acoustics in the restaurant can make it seem loud.I'm assuming that the majority of people reading this review page are those visiting Disneyland from out of town.

Each time?  Where is the manager?  After spending 10 bucks a pop on our four margaritas, 12 more on our appetizer, and 20 plus for our dinner plates, we had planned on having more cocktails / wine with a dessert.  But instead we couldn't get done soon enough.  Where was the manager?  I thought about this the entire night.  I believe that if these people were asked to leave the manager would have received a standing ovation and the respect of all the dining patrons in the restaurant.  But it didn't happen.  We are turning into a nation of pansies.  Our people that are hired to be in positions like this restaurant manager demonstrated a tolerance of such ignorant behavior at the expense of the entire restaurant, because we are all growing accustomed to poorly behaved people.  We all are to be blamed because we are accepting of this in many ways.  With our baby sitter included and our entire bill, this was a 100 plus dollar night for us.  We could have just driven around the block and sat at the bar at Chili's.  Thanks people.  Thank you, PF Chang's.  I would have had a conversation with the manager, but she never came out to discuss it with me.",92802

So delectably light and crisp with a wonderful sweet and sour plum sauce, I could've finished another order by myself! As entrees we ordered, Mongolian beef, lo mein combo and shrimp with lobster sauce (that lacked sauce...disappointed) were average. Maybe it was because our server informed us that they ran out of white rice and it was almost done cooking. 30 minutes later and after countless apologies from our server, we got ONE small bowl of rice and was still undercooked!  I can't believe that a Chinese restaurant would run out of white rice....

We left at 11...with 3 exhausted kids. We had to cancel plans for tomorrow, because the kids will be too exhausted to go. No apology from the manager at the onset of our conversation.

With so many choices in the area, go to another restaurant.",92802

I'm guessing there was a bottle of soy sauce in the kitchen with a loose cap and one thing lead to another...we didn't send it back, but we also didn't eat it.

3303,"321 W Katella Ave Ste 120 Anaheim, CA 92802",Krystal R.,"Wellington, FL",2/22/2014,2,"It seems that PF Changs has lost it's lackluster appeal. I dined with my husband and our two foodie kids. My husband and I had often frequented PF changs before kids and we wanted to take them since I saw that there was a kids menu that seemed appropriate. Whenever dining with kids, our standard rule is to order the kids dishes first to come out ASAP. I ordered the kids honey chicken and baby Buddhas feast steamed...thinking it would be tender. I had to request the vegetables to be fork tender and they came back still hard to bite. The waitress had said she spoke with the chef to make sure they were well done, but I guess the chef ignored the request and the veggies were not well done as requested. It was highly entertaining to not give my baby food while our dishes had arrived. The vegetables had seemed lost because it took 20 minutes for it arrive back to our table and by that time - our kids were finished eating. Luckily I had brought food as a back-up plan. The main dishes we ordered Mongolian beef and Chang shrimp were great but it seems the portions have reduced and the shrimp looked pretty tiny. We were also here for a special occasion and it was notated in our reservation that we were celebrating a birthday and our server had noticed it after we paid the bill. She offered to box something to take home but we didn't have time for that. I was very disappointed with our dining experience and might not make another visit with the kids.",92802

Came on a Friday night about 7. We had no wait at all, score. My friend got a glass of wine, which she reported was sour. I guess the bottle had been sitting around a while. We had a coupon for free lettuce wraps. I'm not usually a fan, but they were pretty good. We got Wonton soup, which was actually disappointing. There were too many mushrooms and the shrimp was small and low quality, not what I've come to expect. We also got the Chang's spicy chicken, which apparently you can't screw up. Thank goodness, because its the best thing on the menu. Our waitress Kiri was great. But when she gave us the check, she said that it was rung up by another waitress, wtf? I guess she had more tables. That sucked for her. Anyway, this other girl didn't apply the lettuce wrap coupon, so we had to wait another 10 minutes for that to be corrected.

The waitress was great, constantly re-filling drinks, and she was very attentive. I wish I remembered her name. Food did take a little while to come out, but the appetizers were brought out pretty quickly. One of the girls in our party complained about the taste of her martini - which tasted like soap - and the waitress took the drink back, offered another - and even comped it. Waitress was really nice and offered to split up the check to make it easier on us all. Happy Hour was over and the drinks were a little pricey, and were weak! So drink before you come! Appetizers ordered were the lettuce wraps-which were good, and spring rolls - which were okay. I ordered the honey shrimp - and it was delicious!! And I'm not a big seafood fan either. I can't remember what everyone else ordered, but everyone left happy. We will be back soon. Just wish the prices were more reasonable.

My husband and I were in town to hang out and watch the football games and after they were over we decided to go to my hands down favorite place ever.. Pf Changs. We were told it would be a 35 min wait and we decided to stay... It was more like 10 min, exceptional! We were seated on the patio which was very nice, comfortable and clean and we were tended to immediately by our waiter Theron. He was friendly, was very happy and was amazing!!! There was a Hispanic gentleman that was on the patio as well that was incredibly friendly and cheerful and was talking with us about the football games as my husband and I both had 49er jerseys on. Our food was incredible as always and we had stellar service. Being from Bakersfield we frequent PF Changs a lot, more than a few times a month.  No matter what town we stop to visit in we always like to try pf changs in the area and it never ever fails us...its amazing .

So why not just front the bill for something that you can be rest assured is delicious and filling? If this sounds like your cup of tea venture into PF Changs. I'm  a seasoned veteran of this Asian fusion eatery son these are my tips. If you want a delicious appetizer to start that will do more than just add $ to your bill then go with the Chicken Lettuce wraps (vegetarian lettuce also available). Now this is where the fun comes in, the dishes are large enough to do a family style shmorgishborg dinner. So feel free to order a variety and share them...or don't if you're like that. Now my wife and I usually split an order of Mongolian Beef that comes with brown rice. Most dishes are large enough to do this, which is a way for us po' folks to enjoy a romantic evening out on a budget. Also, pairing with other rice and noodle dishes is a fantastic way to have the best of both worlds (I recommend the Singapore Street Noodles). And that's that.

I got my food spicy, and when I ran out of water, it took a while for my waiter to notice. Also, when I asked for more rice, it took so long for the waiter to get it to me that I ate the rest of my Mongolian beef without it. The service brings my rating down to a flat 3.",92802

You would assume she would be apologetic, assuming she just didn't see us but she was RUDE!! Rolled her eyes and took another 5 minutes to get us menus. After that we sat for a good 20 minutes before I could wave her down again to get an order in. Yes they were slightly busy but if you are working in a corporate bar near downtown Disney you should be able to handle a 20 top bar with 2 bartenders. We finally got our drinks and ordered an app, we were going to have dinner there but by the time they came over to get our order we were so over it.

It all started about a month ago our order took such a long time to come out and it was a relatively slow night, on the plus side of that situation they gave us a complimentary appetizer to make up for the long wait. Last night however was too much to handle, it was a Wednesday night and since it was raining out and near Disney I thought to make reservations for a party of 2. We first arrived and were sat on time, we were told the server would be right with us. Being a server myself and seeing it was a little crowded I prepared myself for a couple minute wait. This is where is started getting ridiculous, it took the server 10 minutes to come over to our table just to greet us, then it took an additional 10 minutes to get our drinks to the table (non alcoholic by the way so they should have never taken that long) it's now been 20 minutes and we were just getting our drinks, by then we had decided what to order so we placed our orders right when we got our drinks. We ordered one appetizer, and two entrees. It took 55 minutes for the appetizer to arrive at our table. By that time we were starving and a little upset, we couldn't find our server or management anywhere. An additional 20 minutes went by before our food came out. Safe to say we were a little upset. I don't think I'll be coming back to this location for a very long while.

It came with an appetizer, two soups, 2 entrees, and a desert. We chose the chicken lettuce wraps for the appetizer (delicious!) and the egg-drop soup (also delicious). We added the lo-mein to our two entrees and chose the mongolian beef and crispy honey chicken. All delicious except for the honey chicken, which was just a 'meh'. The dessert was just two small cups (not much bigger than a shot glass) of whatever your group chooses. And even though we were pretty full, our group was still kind of disappointed by the dessert sizes.So this P.F. Changs is pretty much up to par with all the other ones that i've been to.

The Singapore street noodles were amazing, with the right amount of curry flavour and juicy shrimp- I definitely recommend ordering this dish if you're looking for a carb option. the ahi tuna tartare was delicious but it was kinda hard to eat since the wonton shell cracked easily. On the drink front, the Moscow Mules are strong and taste good. The key lime pie dessert drink tastes exactly like key lime pie. Cons: the kitchen isn't managed effectively.

I had never been to PF changs so before i could agree we were on our way there. This place was packed which is normally a good sign. It was about a 45 minute wait so we headed to the bar for a few drinks before our meal. I wasnt really in the drinking mood but I got a Absolute mandarin and sprite. The bartender made it just right! After baby sitting our drinks for 30 minutes or so we get the buzz. *ring ring* thats us. We ended up getting a table outside which wasnt bad at all since it was nice night out. We order PF changs for two. It starts off with soup. I ordered the hot and sour and he got the egg drop. Hot and sour was ok tasted like some mexican food my mom makes called ""fedaeo"". He let me try the egg drop soup and WOW i wish i would have gotten that it had so much flavor! For our starter we had to get the Chicken lettuce wrap i had heard so much about and let me tell you it did not disappoint. The cool moist pieces of lettuce were a perfect combination with the chicken. I could not stop eating them. Thinking about them right now is making my mouth water! On to the entree! We decided on Pepper Steak and Sweet and sour pork. This completed our ""chicken, beef and pork"" for the day. HAHA. I thought the pepper steak was a little to salty for me but it was still decent. Comparing to the pepper steak at president thai which IMO is a LOT better. The sweet and sour pork on the other hand had good pieces of meat but all the veggies just had a weird taste to them. There was one in particular that had us wondering ""what the ... is that"" Haha. We managed to cram just about all of the food down our throats and we were feeling pretty full at this point, BUT wait their's more? Dessert. I think i ended up get some cheese cake velvet cake and he got something with chocolate both topped the meal off pretty good but im not a big sweets person so it was just ok for me.",92802

I was recovering from a knee injury that evening and after we had been seated I propped my knee on a chair. Well Mr. Manager grabbed the chair without asking, and my leg crashed to the floor in a flurry of pain.

WHAT!!  She called the manager who removed the charge for that dish & brought out a second dish of the shrimp, and got our desserts (part of the prix fixe menu) which were little cheesecakes in a shot glass.  UGH!  My youngest tasted it & said Mom they put cough syrup on the top of the cheesecake & yes, it tasted like overly tart cough syrup.  The ONLY part of the fiasco that was positive was the service.  The waitress & the Manager were great!  Now if only someone can fix that restaurant so it tastes like the other's we've been to.  I'm sorry, but we'll never waste our $ on this location again",92802

Called at 3:23 to see where I was at on the waitlist. They said another 20 minutes.  Went back in at 3:55 and the girl in the front named Ryan  said she didn't check me in with an attitude. If you don't like your job get a new one. I left because if that's the first impression I'm out. I should have listen to all of the yelp reviews with there bad customer service.,90703

They are incompetent and have the worst service I've ever received. Not only did they manage to get a phone order wrong, but they never corrected the issue after calling them to let them know about it. We called to let them know that the order was completely wrong. The girl who took our order (Jessica) managed to admit that it was wrong and asked if we wanted a refund or remake it. We told her to remake it and she said it'll be 15-20 minutes. Then about 5-10 minutes later, her manager, Jasmine calls back to ask the same questions. She was rude and when we picked up the phone, her greeting was, ""This is PF Chang's, how can we help you?"" ?????? You called us why would you ask how can you help us if we already spoke to your employee? Then she said your order might cost more???? I am dumbfounded by her phone manners considering I have managed in customer service and in the restaurant business for 10+ years. She gave a heap of attitude while apologizing (LOL how does that even work) and asked if we wanted a refund. I'm sure we spoke to Jessica before asking her to correct the order and she confirmed? All in all, without putting every detail of the phone conversation, she refused to give her employees name (it was on the receipt BTW) and put us on hold for 5+ minutes, only to come back and ask AGAIN if we wanted a new order or a refund. I have no words for this branch of P.F. Chang's. We have allergies to meat and they are clueless to what would've actually happened if we actually ate it. When she came back from hold, her voice completely changed and sounded more apologetic. We asked if this was the same person and she confirmed. Honestly, it's such a slap in the face and I would NEVER come here and tell everyone not to eat at this branch again.",90703

The Chang's chicken skin was mushy like it had been out for a while and our noodles were not even completely coated with sauce. The only redeeming part was the lettuce wrap and wonton soup. I had not eaten here in a long time and sadly it will be a long time until I return again.,90703

The Chicken lettuce wraps and hot & sour soup were perfect appetizers. Kung pao chicken and Mongolian beef were so flavorful. Chicken Lo mein was very comforting.

I ordered takeout and the portions look much smaller than what you actually get when you're dining in. I asked the manager at the front politely and she just nodded her head and said that's how it is and if I want a refund. Didn't even try to help? Ok. The employee at the front was much more nice and helpful than the 'manager' was. Will not be returning to this location due to her attitude. $30 for 10 pieces of small beef???? Makes no sense to me.

On our way back from California Pizza Kitchen with our takeout, I  noticed a couple with a small PG Chang's bag. Hmm, we could have gotten takeout had she offered us that option.

One for the customers who paid for their food. But did not feel like waiting for 2 to 3 hours to get their food. These were the most pissed off customers their.

The way the chicken and the sauces were packed in the container was very odd. The container had 2 compartments, 1 large and 1 smaller compartment. Instead of putting all the chicken in the large compartment and the 2 sauces on the smaller side, 1/2 the chicken was in the small side and 1/2 in the large side with the sauce containers sitting in the chicken. During these times of covid and sanitary measures being critical that seemed to be very unsanitary and downright stupid. I don't know where those sauce containers have been sitting, they shouldn't even have been in the same container with the chicken.

I went up to ask for the status and she say is right away.Where she sat us didn't look like it was the nicest or cleanest area. To be honest this location had an ""outlet"" feel. The ambiance is far from what the other PF Chang locations I have been too. It just wasn't the same feel. We came out for something nice since we were celebrating too and it just didn't give us that feeling. But the price was definitely the same  Our waitress was awesome. Very sweet. And helpful.

I had ordered a bag of steak entree and it was so dried out and the side that came with it were I roasted potato and then brown rice and they were both just completely dry it was awful gave it to my dog so then my family wanted to try pfchangs for a second time.  four of us ordered the Kung Pao chicken and all of us thought it was dry the chef there had cooked the chicken so long that it was dry it wasn't good at all so two strikes I'm not going to go back to that location. However the PF Chang's in Long Beach at Shoreline Village is it really good cuz I went there last month with my granddaughter and it was really yummy so clearly it has to be the chefs at the Cerritos do not know how to prepare the food where is nice and tender and juicy and not all dried out,90703

Some unmasked and unwilling to cover. P.F. Chang's did nothing to ease the social distancing but made things worse with lack of organization, staffing and unseen or herd from leadership. Response for manager was give them 24 hrs to call back.... time is ticking NO CALL BACk. Pictures show only a few staff working, bags and bags of food that sat there for two hours or more.Those that yelled the loudest seem to get theirs first. However for every order that finally went out half were brought back incorrect.  After waiting 2 hrs and 43 minutes (mom you gotta know I love you) order received...

The last time Ive been to PFC's was when i was 10 and i always had this (juvenile) unmemorable experience plus all my family brainwashed me Into thinking that it was ""commercialized"" ""Americanized"" Asian food. Well last night, I was by my hometown mall and decided I'm going to give this place a chance! I'm so happy I did! The blushing geisha alone is why I'd give 5 stars, because it's like everything I've been looking for in a drink.... like MAMA IM CRYING because I loved it that much. Why  I did dock one star, well you'll see below: 1. BLUSHING GEISHA: I'm a hardcore fan of tart drinks and this hit right on the nail! Grapefruit vodka, blood orange purée, basil seeds and maybe lemon soda? I can't remember but DELISH. 2. Lobster avo roll: light, tangy with an interesting (curry leaf) herby pop! 3. Veggie lettuce wraps: full of flavor! Would order again, and what's amazing is the spicy horse Radish-y sauce. 4. Crab wontons: WHOA, no cream cheese or artificial meat here! I love that you could see the crab bits. 5. Long life noodles with prawns: I don't remember ordering it with the shrimp but our waiter brought it out with them on and I'm glad she did! Shrimp was lightly fried and the noodles garlic with some citrus flavor. I loved it because most garlic noodles end up being more salty. Here's where I also dock one star- for a Chinese place the noodles were really soft! Like you can give them to a baby and they wouldn't need to chew soft! Lol I'm not sure if it was just my batch but I'd order the noodz al dente next time! All in all, I'm happy I can come back to this nearby location and yes I'm no longer a hater! Haha :)",90703

Each dish also comes out one at a time, so you eat everything right when it is piping hot!Food: Do not stress over ordering the right thing, especially if you are not eating alone. Absolutely everything is amazing, and if each person orders something different, no one misses out! My personal favorites are the Crispy Honey Shrimp, Ahi Poke Bowl, and Kung Pao Dragon Roll. I mean this wholeheartedly when I say it: P.F. Chang's Crispy Honey Shrimp is the best I have ever tasted!Atmosphere: A beautiful decor, both inside and out. The perfect spot for relaxation while bonding with loved ones. Quiet setting for friendly conversations, with the added joy of getting to explore multiple dishes together! Cleanliness: P.F. Chang's cleanliness is as plain as the sky is blue. Spotless dishes and tables no matter where you go! The restrooms are in absolute pristine condition as well. Prices: Almost everything is within $10-16. The food quality and sheer volume is definitely worth the cost in my opinion!

Which is Bacardi Limon, Apple pucker, lime and mint leaves.   Service was average.  Although our waitress came around maybe once or twice maybe 3 times tops, still tipped her well.   She had a great attitude.  And it seemed they had her doing so many other things beside waiting on her tables/customers which is not her fault.  Food: starter - Chang's spare ribs.  Were good. Not awesome.   Much better spare ribs at The Original Thai BBQ, hands down.  Cerritos location is good.  But for best go the Original location in LA on 3rd street.  Mongolian beef - was great.   Not awesome. Especially with the EXTRA serving of chives.  OMG! Like they were hooking us up on the abundant amount of chives.  Smh.  Chang's spicy chicken - not spicy, not awesome.  Orange peel chicken - was good.  Not great or awesome.  You may get better orange chicken at Ming's or even Tao Wok. Pad Thai - was Pad Aye aye aye.  Total disappointment.  Absolutely no flavor what so ever.  Much better pad Thai at Thai Corner.  Hands down. Even the white rice was sub par.   And the chili paste hot sauce was absolutely horrible.  Salty AF... which ruined one of my servings I had to just discard.  Grand total: $116.95.  Not awesome for not awesome food.   Average at best.  You will not be seeing me here again.  You can catch me having bbq spare ribs @ The Original Thai BBQ on 3rd street.  Having awesome Pad Thai and Curry @ Thai corner,  Paramount and Carson in Lakewood.

We had to flag him down for water, napkins, utensils, and to check on missing food. He nonchalantly walked over every time like he was in no rush to help or do anything. To top off bad service, I ordered a new dish... lobster fried rice. The rice was super dry, had a random sweetness to it, and microscopic, greasy fried lobster tails thrown on top. No! No! No!

Know that.  When I called from the curb side pickup parking spot and was told to come in, I told them all these things.  The person on the phone replied "" yeah, well, whatever.""  As you walk up you have tables on both sides of you full of unmasked people.  Nope. So if you're wondering why their overall rating is not even 3 stars perhaps it's because their customer service and attention to safety are precluding customers like me from coming back.  I don't post many reviews but because this involved COVID safety I felt I should. If they were honest about not having curb side pickup instead of lying about it three times I never would have ordered from there. BTW the food was bland.",90703

The iced tea barely had any mango taste to it and was a disappointment. As for my main dish, the chicken pieces had great flavor with their crispy coating. The slices of orange melded surprisingly well with the chicken. How to ruin it all? Provide a bowl of dry rice that is in hardened clumps. An embarrassment.A mini dessert of strawberry coconut cake lifts my rating to 2.5 stars. Served in a glass jar, the cake was moist and the coconut flavored topping was excellent, only surpassed by the strawberries on top.Service was fast, efficient but non-personable.

We finally went to dine-in in Mon, 6/15 for dinner. It didn't have the ""PF Chang"" feel as we were walked in to be seated. We were seated at a half booth/half chair section for our party of 4. My first impression was the booths were stained and dirty and wondered why they hadn't bothered to clean them during  the time they were closed due to the quarantine. There were quite a few areas that were stained, that really turned me off. I shrugged it off trying to give it the benefit of the doubt & because I was really excited to finally be eating there. We ordered the Chicken wrapsfar an appetizer which was really good but the Orange Peel Chicken and Honey Shrimp did not have the ""PF Chang quality"" I've had in the past, it was a little dry and served like warm. I'm not sure why this would be, being the restaurant was pretty empty and it was a Monday. The waiters weren't terrible but weren't overly friendly either.

There are so many good authentic Chinese and Asian restaurants in the area that are more affordable, so there's really no need to ever subject myself to tonight's fiasco again.

Arrived about 10 mins early and checked in. While I waited I noticed there was a bunch of tables open which annoyed me because we didn't get seated until after 5:45pm even with tables open. The place itself is inside the mall so its smaller compared to others I've visited. Our booth was next to the bar and while we waited for our food, I noticed that the bartender making drinks left his own personal items (water bottle) on the counter by the bar. Also, even though he drank from his water bottle he did not wash his hands when he returned back to making drinks. That grossed me out due to the fact that it was his own personal reuseable bottle which ego knows when was the last time it was washed or where it's been. The only saving grace here was our waiter Marvin. He was super nice and even came around frequently to offer refills and check on our table. I had a coupon for a free order of Kung Pow chicken which he totally honored with no problems. They also had a promo for Friday's where they offered endless chicken fried rice for $10.

So, I am happy when the state allows outside dining because my partner birthday was coming up on July25, 2020. On Wednesday July 22,2020 I called to check if they offer outside dining, they said yes and that this day the last call is at 830 pm. So I call today July 25, 2020 to check the outside dining last call . Carmen tells me 9:00pm. Understandable . So, I get off at 6 pm and my partner gets off at 7pm . We hurry up to get ready to get there before 9 . We arrive at 8:23 pm. The hostess/idk manager says she decided to close the outside dining early at 8:00pm. I tell her why if I was told 9 was last call . She said that  she already made that call and that is that . I guess the customers should rely only on takeout. What a disappointment. I had to travel to this location because the PF Chang's in Torrance Ca is logical and only offer takeout . Being truthful to a business is important . Having employees that make the calls is bad for business . They should stick to a standard time . 9:00pm seemed reasonable .",90703

Lol The server told us that this meal is actually  vegetarian, which makes sense. Lol the flavor is okay though, just too much veggies for our tasting. it also comes with steam rice. We would probably enjoy it more, of there were more chicken than vegies.               The chicken lettuce wrap is okay. It taste like smokey bbq. It's a  good healthy option.              The vietnamese lava cake is ok. Nothing really special IMO.

Very nice guy and answered all of my questions about the menu items. He kept us informed on when our food would arrive and also how the food was tasting when received. It was pretty good (not too hot, which is a good thing). The ambiance was very nice. It had a lounge feel to it. The decor was very modern and beautiful. It was also a clean establishment, which is very important when dining out. They do have outdoor seating, but it was a bit chilly. So no one was out there at the moment. But it will definitely be nice to sit out there and enjoy your cocktails and food around springtime. Only thing was we didn't get any fortune cookies. Otherwise, everything was great.",90703

Came here on a Friday night at 6pm, told the wait was 5 minutes for a seat for our party of 4. Took about 10 minutes to get seated even though there were plenty of open seats. First observation while waiting was there were about 5 servers and hostesses that just stood around chit chatting. No sense of urgency to get guests seated none were welcoming. I'm not looking for anyone to be chipper, but at least some sense of customer service would have been nice.When we finally got seated, 10 minutes had passed and no one even came back to say they'd be with us or take our drink order. Again -- it wasn't busy. Server came around with a tray of food a bit later and asked ""egg drop soup""? My husband replied we didn't order anything nor has anyone come to our table. Again, no acknowledgement from the server, or any of the other 4 that walked by. Needless to say, after 20 minutes of sitting, we walked out. Had someone acknowledged us and said that they'd be with us shortly, I would have gladly waited and think twice about getting up and leaving. Sadly, the lack of customer service would not bring me back here.

How inconsiderate. And sadly it was the assistant manager (Mary!?!?) that did it. Literally just didn't care about the noise she's making. Needs to take etiquette classes (not one is enough as far as I am concern with how she acts). Everybody is just hanging out in the open and loudly talking. I certainly don't need to hear the Chang's drama. And once again SHE is a participant as well. Veronica is an okay bartender. She takes order and give you your drinks and she's good at that. But then never rechecked. Had to asked for water instead of offering and checking. Didn't even ask for my I.D.  Done eating for 20 minutes at least and the bowl is still in front of me. So sloppy. Not a care in the world. But I'm a good tipper. Still gave $10 out of $26 bill. Definitely needs some polishing. I could've just went to Panda Express if I didn't care about the atmosphere.

First off, it's a mall location, so don't get your hopes too high. I'm used to the nice ambiance and decor of the stand-alone places. There is an attempt here, but it falls flat. Appetizers: Cecilia's Dumplings, shrimp. Sauce needed some acid or soy. It was tasty, but still cool on the inside. Soup: Chicken noodle. It came with tomatoes. Cherry tomatoes, cut in half. It was odd. Flavor was ok, balance of heat and savor, but chicken was slimy. Noodles were good, and there were plenty of them. Main dishes: Mongolian Beef and Kung Pao Shrimp.MB- like I remember it from all the other times I've had it. Good pieces of beef with a nice glaze, very flavorful and true to what I expect from P.F. Chang's. Got to the table like-warm though. (They weren't busy, and it came out quickly, so I can understand why it was only warm) KPS- hot dish and great flavor. The veggies and shrimp, again, are just like I remember from other locations, and it is the flavors that keep us coming back. Others- they don't have the chili-garlic paste we love from P.F. Chang', and they don't make the sauce tableside anymore. Sad. Our service was spectacular! Rey did an awesome job and was attentive and friendly. TLDR: Overall, classic dishes were awesome, I miss the sauces, they aren't the same, service was great, ambiance is lacking.",90703

My group decided to sit on their patio and it was so comfortable and peaceful. It wasn't too crowded at the time we went and the patio has happy hour for an additional hour until 7pm. Our servers name was Kass, and she was super attentive and very nice! She took the extra time to talk about their motto and offer us reward cards which is much appreciated! Their happy hour is awesome!! They have appetizers at $5-$6 and cocktails and beers for $4-$6. The Asian pear mojito and blackberry martini are so so yummy! Skip the honey and thyme cocktail though it's so sour!!! Their appetizers were very good. The dumplings with shrimp were awesome! It's a shame they only came with four. The spicy tuna is average but comes with 8 pieces so it's good if you're paying the happy hour price. I wouldn't order it off the normal menu. Their cauliflower tempura had a really good flavor profile but when something is called tempura you expect it to be crunchy----which it was not! The lettuce wraps were again good in flavor but the lettuce was so cold. It made it a little unappealing and hard to actually ""wrap"". In my experience the lettuce wraps are normally with steamed lettuce unless this has changed. Lastly their mini desserts look delicious! I tried the triple chocolate and it was good. Perfect size for one person. I hope to get to try some entrees next time but I would definitely return for the patio ambiance. The inside looks a little too dark and cramped for my taste though.",90703

We ordered sweet sour chicken, Kung pao chicken, lettuce wraps and egg rolls and chicken fried rice. It was all cold and soggy nasty soggy. The sweet sour chicken soggy, eggs rolls soggy, Kung pao chicken dry and super spicy super spicy from sitting so long. The rice was dry so let's just say it was all just nasty dry or soggy. Lettuce wraps did not even feed two adults and two children not enough lettuce nor chicken. I get we are in a pandemic I get that they are working during it. But like I said before this location really needs to step up it's game because this is not the first time the food and service has sucked. It's close to our home so going to the Long Beach location during these times was out of the question.

If management is reading this, this guy really deserves a raise!!! I almost forgot I was in a P.F. Chang's.I was then handed off to Mariah, who gave great recommendations on dishes to order. I got the Wok Flamed Filet Mignon. It came out promptly and it was absolutely delicious. It reminded me of a dish we have back in Peru called Lomo Saltado with a twist. Everyone else in our party loved the food and could not be happier with the experience as a whole. The entire restaurant was spotless and seemed to be running smoothly. Props to this place.

Everytime I asked for a waiter they would act like they wouldnt hear you. And when it took an hour for our food to come out I lost my appetite after my son pointed out flys in the kitchen by the drinks because you can see through a window for the kitchen. The real reason why im writing this though and what ticked me off is that when I asked them to pack up my food and cancel the dish that ended up cold and ive been waiting for almost an hour for -the waiter started giving attitude to my four year old son. My son doesnt know what obviously is going on and when he got the fortune cookies with the check and the waiter couldnt even answer him back!!

If it were up to me, he would have received this tip....Tip: work on your customer service skillsFOODThe food was sub-par.  I've been to many PF Chang's restaurants and this was the only one that served my food borderline cold.  I ordered hot tea, and it was luke-warm.  We ordered the WALNUT SHRIMP WITH MELON and CRISPY HONEY CHICKEN, and the temperature on both of those were definitely incorrect.  It's as if the kitchen had it ready for awhile, but the server forgot about it.  That is just a guess.  Taste was a miss for me today.  The food was just ok.  The WALNUT SHRIMP WITH MELON was good, but it tasted a little more sour and less creamy than the other locations serve it.  The CRISPY HONEY CHICKEN was bland.  It was missing something.  So, once I was able to flag Jacob down for some chili sauce, I was finally able to add a little flavor to it.We also ordered the SHRIMP TEMPURA ROLL which was good and CHICKEN LETTUCE WRAPS which are always a fave.  But still, not as good as the other locations.OVERALLI am still a PF Chang's customer, but I will absolutely be avoiding THIS particular location.  I live in Cerritos and would rather drive to Long Beach to get my PF Chang's fix.",90703

My bf and I asked them several times when we'd be seated even though we saw a plethora of booths open. When we finally did get seated, our waitress was totally MEH and not friendly at all. No ""thanks for waiting"", nothing. Maybe if she was friendlier, it would've slightly made up for our crappy ""waiting forever"" experience.We ordered the tempura calamari with tempura veggies, which was okay. I got the Korean stir fry chicken which was also okay. The side of white rice that our meals came with was soooo MEH and it was so dry!! I expect way better rice from an ""Asian"" restaurant. I will say that the Mongolian beef and the cocktails were pretty good, though. Overall, I really did not enjoy our long ass wait, and I couldn't stand the annoying trendy music they were playing. This was definitely an entirely different experience from the P.F. Chang's I went to in Santa Monica.

Upon arriving to the restaurant there where multiple lines with no proper signs to which line is for what service. This restaurant did a GREAT JOB in putting everyone at risk including staff with no social distancing. Or asking customers to wear face mask like every other store/ restaurant. I was told order where running 2 hours late to check back. Mind you i drove from Whittier after waiting 2 hours my prouder was still not ready. While i was waiting i noticed the orders that where being sent out where wrong! These people where returning touched food. I mean again we're in the middle of a pandemic. Shame on PF Chang's for not only putting your customers at risk but also your employees.

What the P.F Stand for? She didn't answer...  Once visiting the place we got asked if we wanted to sit on the patio or inside, I opted for inside since I spotted about 4-6 tables opened and I was hungry to try some of that Dim Sung when I got back home.

While waiting I would give the waitresses that look that screamed ""GIRLLLL THERE ARE 4 TABLES OPENED WHY THE H!CK Am I still waiting?"" Eventually we got seated and I checked out their drinks menu and found it to be a bit EH on the beer department. About 5-6 beers on TAP AND THE REST were bottled. I got myself a Corona and got chugging as I felt I was in store for something special... 1ST Plate we tried was the Walnut Shrimp which was decent and was extra creamy. I like that.  2nd Plate was Noodles based which was pretty good but the Shrimp it came with was a bit on the salty side and not the good kind. 3rd Plate was a fucking mess as they got our order wrong and I just didn't care at this point so I ate it. Bill came out to around 110 which wasn't that bad for being a Cerritos located Restaurant.In all honesty though just spend 7 Dollars at the nearest Chinese Fast Food joint and get yourself a 6 Pack of Corona from Pepitos Liquor Store.

The restaurant seemed to have more employees than guests but seating was available so we went straight to the bar.We ordered drinks and appetizers. Our drinks came fast and our bartender, Dez as nice and took care of us. We waited a good 30 minutes when we decided to ask about our appetizers which seemed to be taking longer than what I've experienced at other chains.Finally about 10 minutes later our potstickers arrived and they looked like they had been sitting for a bit. I cut into the potsticker only to find they were cold. We were left with a bad taste in our mouth that we no longer wanted it. We finished our drink and lettuce wraps and called it an evening.My manager, Juan came over and apologized. We waited another 15 minutes to get the potstickers removed from the bill. I was quite surprised that the manager did not comp the entire bill, it was only $45. For the poor service we received I would have expected that at the least. I think I may stick to driving to Anaheim to eat as I know I will get good service.",90703

Before PF Chang's use to be a great restaurant and had such high standards, but over the past few pick up orders I have done it's been complete disappointment and embarrassment. Tonight when I went to go pick up my order not only did I have to check it multiple times to assure that my order was correct (cause my family knows PF Chang's always miss something from your order). But when I got home and open my order i was beyond disappointed. The food was portions and plating was beyond embarrassing. Not only did the containers looked completely empty but the containers were all wrong. The containers are divided into two sections a big one and a smaller section, in one of the entrees the meat was in the bigger section and and the rice was in the smaller. I get another entree and the smaller section was filled with meat and the bigger section was filled with rice. Like the containers are already empty but you're going to reduced my entree size as well?! COME ON PF CHANGS I usually spend over 200 dollars on my orders and to get mediocre portions and food for that price is not okay! I'm starting to feel like maybe Panda Express is a better route!",90703
3584,"360 Los Cerritos Ctr Ste C15 Cerritos, CA 90703",Kat R.,"Norwalk, CA",10/29/2017,3,"Went in and tried PF Chang's for the first time ever. Going in I didn't really expect much, because I was pretty sure that this was an Americanized Chinese. Basically if you want to eat in a nice setting go here and if you want really good Chinese food I suggest looking at other nearby Chinese restaurants in the area. Vegetarian Lettuce WrapThis was a favorite in our table. It had chestnuts,mushroom, crispy noodles, and other things. Their wasabi sauce was spicy and delicious. The lettuce cups they gave us was very small which made it hard to really enjoy without being messy. Food: Mongolian Beef My mom ordered this dish and after one bite she spit it out. According to her, this dish isn't your traditional Mongolian beef, because it was very sweet. Majority of our table didn't try this since everyone but my mom is a pescatarian. Miso Salmon My dad didn't want to share this plate. He enjoyed it very much. Long Life Noodles & PrawnMy boyfriend and mom found this dish very delicious. I on the other hand didn't enjoy it. I felt it lacked a bit of flavor and the noodles were a bit dry. Walnut ShrimpThis was a favorite. I never really got why you would put honey and shrimp in one plate, but I gave it a shot. It was surprisingly good. The shrimp was crispy and the walnut added a nice touch. The melon that came with it was very soggy. Gross. Mao Pao TofuThis was another favorite in the table. It was flavorful and delicious. The tofu was not overly fried and the sauce it was in was delicious. The broccoli that came with it was perfectly cooked. Our server actually put this in the house, because she confused it with our original order of ""Buddha's Feast"". Buddha's FeastThis was a disappointment. We didn't really enjoy this dish, because it lacked flavor. It seems like it was just stir fried and they didn't season it well. Drinks:They have a standard amount of drinks available. My parents had the coconut drink and the strawberry limeade... my mom really enjoyed their coconut drink. I got a taste of it, it was thick and creamy. I had the Peach Whisky and it was delicious. It was strong too :)Service: Our server was very nice and enjoyed the service she provided us. What I did not really like about this restaurant was when I asked the person who brought our food if it was the correct dish he had no clue what it was. You work here and you should at least know how each dish looks like.Overall, it's not a place I would frequent and have a craving for. The service provided by our service was excellent. When our table experienced some troubles (one of our orders didn't come out and brought out the wrong order) she was able to make us feel at ease and didn't need a manager involvement to make things right. I wished I remembered her name, but I was pretty buzzed at that point. But yeah try it if you've never been!",90703

I brought my dog with me and I was afraid that they would not allow my dog in the patio area but when I asked them they said they would allow for me to be seated in the patio area with my dog. The patio was empty since it was a cold day but they had fire heater on the patio so it wasn't cold at all. There were a couple of times my dog would get off the leash and wander off and the waiters would not be rude to me or tell me to leash my dog. They were very friendly about it compared to other restaurants I have been to. I also had my dog on my lap couple of times and they didn't yell at me or disrespect me in any way. They were consistently providing me with good service and checking up on my dog and I. They have a variety of yummy options and I was having a hard time deciding what to get.

Service was great, the waiters paid much attention to every customer and got us everything we needed.The food was decent at best. The crispy honey chicken was beautifully cooked and presented. The fact that it came with a bowl of rice (unlimited rice at that) was a huge plus. The long life noodles and prawn were weird to be honest. The noodles were a bit salty and felt as if there was too much seasoning. The shrimp was way too salty. I love all  shrimp but after eating here, I guess l love most shrimp. The price of the food was outrageous. $15 for a plate of chicken? $15 for the small plate of noodles? Stop worrying about making money and start worrying about your quality of food.

The first time, the food was very good in the 3-4 star range, everything tasted extremely fresh and very flavorful.  All the the entrees arrived on time and everyone seemed to enjoy the meal.This time, there were 5 of us, and the bill ended up around $190 for the five of us.  None of the dishes were what any of us considered tasty or really good.  The appetizers didn't seem fresh.  The egg rolls seemed like they had stayed under a heat lamp for a while, and this was probably the case because the server brought the egg rolls to us in about 2 min after we ordered them, there wasn't enough time to cook them in that time.The fried rice, mongolian beef, and salmon all were a C or lower.  Not worthy of returning the food, but so bad that I don't want to spend this much money at a place that is obviously hit or miss.  With so many other places in Cerritos, we will just go somewhere else.",90703

So we tell him what's was wrong and he just stud there dumb founded so we left. It's just dumb how they have so many waiters walking around but none of them are actually attending guest.

I got up and told the hostess, excuse me there is something wrong here we been waiting more than an hour and noticed there is people going in before us. All she did was apologized and we were seated.

Finally ..one says hey and without saying I will get these ...he moves on and then the other bar tender says 5 min later ..I can get those. I said ..that would be good.

Food was great quality and very tasty. The only thing I didn't like was the front desk and manager weren't very aware of the vegan options on the menu. There were lots of vegan options but they should be more knowledgeable about that in order to accommodate. I'm vegan and my boyfriend is pescatarian and we both loved it! The garlic green beans were unreal! We also ordered the cauliflower, honey shrimp, asparagus, lettuce wraps and pear mojit. Everything was very tasty! We were served by Mary and she was phenomenal. Knew the menu inside and out and was very honest! We will definitely request her next time we go. She made it a great experience! UPDATE: This was one my favourite restaurants to go to and on December 24th, 2019 me and my fiancé decided to have a date night. We arrived at the restaurant and received great service from the bartender while waiting for a table. Once we got to our table we ordered appetizers and and entrees. We got what we always get: green beans and fried rice well done! The appetizers took very long to come out and when it finally came out it was disappointing. The green beans sat out in the window aisle (my fiancé saw them) and were not hot when they came out, on top of that they were undercooked. This is my favourite item on the menu and I get it all the time so it tasted very rushed. I asked for the rice to be well done (burnt & crispy) and it wasn't. I asked the server to get us some fresh hot green beans and to fry the rice for longer until it was crispy. He came back in probably something like 2 minutes... the rice looked exactly the same. So I asked him to please ask the chef to burn the rice. The server came back and said ""the chef said that's the best he can do"". I'm sorry but we don't go out to pay $10-20 per dish for someone to tell us that undercooked & lukewarm items are the best they can do. Going to dinner is not something we do often so this is a treat for us that was ruined. I'm ashamed to say that one of my favourite restaurants would treat their customers like that.

It was a shame for us that we selected your restaurant for our celebration. Our order was not ready on 05/10/20 at 3:00pm. The staff was not available to answer any of our questions and the update that I received came from other customers that were also waiting for their food. Not to mention, your restaurant failed to take the necessary steps to address social distancing considering the COVID-19 pandemic as there were many customers waiting at the same time which makes me believe that customer safety is not your priority.

On Sunday 9/29/19 my husband and I and we took 2 Of our closest friends here (1st time at this location) & first time at P.F. Chang's for our friends. We have been to LB in the past. We chk in & we are told it's a 45 mins wait. We thought it was long & had other choices but still decided to wait. We waited at the bar and yes we bought drinks. So we get called for our table and the hostess offers us only a small booth & we decline it because it's too small for us & didn't want to be uncomfortable. So my husband asks the hostess if we could instead have the other table that was available & she said she couldn't give us that table because it was reserved at that time she was rude and bothered that we even asked her she called her Mgr and she couldn't help either instead they made us wait another 15-20mins and when we finally got sat at the new table we had CERISE SPRAG as our server she said that was her name. I clearly remember what she looks like. She offered us appetizers & we ordered some at this time we are hungry been there almost an hour and a half She then offered us water. Then my husband said I don't want water we want drinks she said oh no guys we should get some food in your systems first. Who is she to tells us that????This is a family friendly place she said.  Um yes we knew that. We understand that and had no intentions of doing anything wrong. We all looked at each other and got really bothered we couldn't believe we were being treated this way!!!! first of all she doesn't know us and only because we were in the bar doesn't give her the right to judge us or assume things. She kept insisting we should have some food first. Excuse me lady!!! Who are you? To decide that for us!! We have never been to a place who treated us that way and we eat out a lot. One of our friends then told her what? Now you're going to be our mother?!!Not even our own mother tells us what to do or not to do or what to eat or not eat, this wasn't going to be free we were going to pay for everything. She then I think realized she should have not said that and offered to buy/pay for our appetizers. No, thank you! We all got up and I personally in her face told her she was very rude talking to us that way and asked her name. She still then said are you guys going to be ok to drive really? We are not kids we are adults! We all decided to leave the restaurant quietly without making a fuss. We could've called the manager and made a big deal but we are not those kind of people and for what the manager seemed useless when we first asked if we could have the reserved table anyways they never went out of their way to try and help us. Bottom line is we will never return to this location.ATTN: UPPER MANAGEMENT your staff needs training and or send them to some educational customer service seminars because they are lacking customer service skills!!!

JJ was working & he was utterly amazing. He made me feel right at home. He consistently checked in to see if I was OK or needed anything. I was never without a cocktail. Once food arrived, he was prompt in asking if everything was to my satisfaction. His banter wants me to come back. In fact, I've already mentioned to friends that we need to come back when JJ is working. Looking to make a trip on a Tues or Wed for Happy Hour. I'm thinking this might be a weekly trip.Thank you so much. Made me a big fan of this location.",90703

I asked for a salad we once had at a different location and made me feel like I was asking for something out of this world. He said that all they had was on the menu with a serious look on his face no smile and not welcoming at all. I also asked what they had to drink with no alcohol and he was just a complete winnie about it. After talking to the manager he confirmed that what I originally asked for was on the menu in the past. That's what Nick should've said instead of making me feel like bad for asking. I came in in a good mood and left in a bad mood because of this waiter. He needs to go apply and work at a fast food restaurant with his attitude.,90703

But the menu I saw on Sunday was pretty much straight up Chinese food.  The same items you can find at Panda Express. The flavor was not much better. I think they spent the majority of their energy and effort on the decor and ambiance. The decor is immaculate. Modern design with lots of clean square lines on the tile , bar top , tables and even the tile on the wall on the exterior. They surely didn't spend the money on training for their servers.  Our server constantly reached over our food to serve our drinks and food and to pick up dishes from our table. I find that to be amateurish and unbecoming of a fine dining experience.  More and more I'm seeing this behavior in most mid-level chain restaurants. Maybe I'm old fashion. Maybe it's because it was Mother's Day. I don't know. I don't consider it a deal breaker. I will likely go back but more for the ambiance rather than the delicious Asian fusion cuisine.",90703

It's for those who want to show they can afford expensive, garbage Americanized Chinese food, knowing damn well they're eating trash. Wish I could give zero stars. My wife and I ordered the crispy honey chicken and the tempura cauliflower. The Crispy Honey Chicken: it states ""Lightly Battered"" but was all batter. The batter was still gummy and tasted like under dried bland lemon chicken from a Chinese to go spot that has food sitting out under a lamp. $15 no thanks! Tempura Cauliflower: the sweet and spicy sauce was way too saucy for the cauliflower. Tempura batter was trash. Couldn't taste any cauliflower, it was as if you were eating just sweet and spicy batter.  Only thing good about this place was the strawberry lemonade. Other than that I don't know why Cerritos allowed this to take over the Red Robin that was originally there. You're asking why I even ate here after my continuous bitching ? Because my wife and I were in a rush and didn't want to walk all over the mall to find something. And in my opinion, Cerritos has way too many Asian food places, some that are actually legit and authentic and you want to throw this commercialized, Americanized and overpriced mediocre ""Chinese"" food in the city?!?!

Cece did a pretty good job and the experience with food was saved by her. She did a good job explaining the menu. However, the most important thing in a restaurant is the food. 1. Crab Wontons: the sauce on the bottom was pretty good except that it was too salty. The crab wontons had very little fillings and were mostly just fried wonton skin. 2. Crispy Honey Chicken: This is my favorite dish that we got today. It was nice. The chicken was a little powdery but that can be overlooked. I loved the little bit of tarty sweet and sour taste. I applaud it for not being salty. 3. Wok fried filet Mignon: TOO SALTY! I could not taste the quality of the meat because of the amount of salt that was in it. I don't know if it was the sauce or something but SOOOO SALTY!4. Lettuce Cups: This is their most renowned dish. It's decently cooked. It was a little salty but otherwise this dish was pretty good. 5. Oolong Chilean Sea Bass: This was so salty. The quality of the fish was there. I loved that they put spinach underneath it. PLEASE PUT LESS SALT ON IT! Or less salt in your sauces. 6. Hokkien Street Noodles: SALTY! I can't remember anything much besides the strong garlic taste and the SALT! I love garlic but the salt was too much.7. Miso Glazed Salmon: I was pretty disappointed because the salmon was too tough. It would've been nice if it was more tender. The sauce was very salty. 8. Mango Ice Tea: It was pretty good as I was downing the drink to quench my thirst from the salt. It was a shame that the server didn't ask me if I wanted for refills but that's minor. The mango was really faint. I could barely taste the mango so that was a bit disappointing.I don't know where they get their salt from but it must be really cheap because they are SUPER generous with it. Either that or the chef's hand was slippery and accidentally spilled half a bottle in all my dishes. Please make your food and sauces less salty. My tongue and the top of my mouth is numb.",90703

The host, whose name I didn't get, wasn't very welcoming. She looked annoyed that there was a line waiting to be seated and she immediately told us it's an hour and 30 minute wait, as if she didn't want us to stay. I told her I'd wait and she took my name and phone number down. So we stood off to the side waiting to be seated for about 10 minutes and she kept giving us a look that even my mother-in-law said ""why does she keep looking at us wrong?"" So we decided to go to Frida Mexican Cuisine. As soon as we were seated at Frida (30 minutes later), I got a notification on my phone that my table was ready. That means the host lied to us.

I arrived earlier and was seated in the bar area around 445pm and ordered a drink and water. After 5:00, my friend let me know she'd be there in a few minutes so I ordered multiple appetizers and more water and  another drink. We were having a great time talking about family, kids, work, etc. After 6 pm, one of the bartender-let us know that happy hour was still going on in case we wanted anymore drinks. We placed a order for our 3rd drink around 6:15ish , and we continued to catch up and talk. Drinking water and finishing apps in between. I decided to place a order for a last drink prior to the end of happy hour. I then get approached by the manager CiCi who states that this is a family restaurant and she was checking I on us bc an additional drink had been ordered, I let her know that I had been there over 2 hours, had multiple appetizers, and 3 glasses of water and was not driving but to go ahead to cancel the drink. I was really upset, so I called to clarify why she approached me and emphasized it was a family restaurant, that would indicate there was something inappropriate in my behavior, she denied any concerns regarding my behavior and stated it was the bartender who felt uncomfortable serving me a additional drink. I told her she needed to change her approach bc it was offensive , bc it doesn't relay they're concern of safety it more implies inappropriate behavior . I will never go there again. I'm educated, with a medical background/license. Mother of 3 and would never carry myself in a inappropriate way.",90703

A friend of ours told us about the recent opening in the Los Cerritos Center. The food was delicious and on request, they adjusted the spiciness of one of our dishes perfectly. The service was exceptional. The manager, Jason, greeted us and made sure we were happy. Although our appetites were satisfied, we couldn't resist their small dessert offerings served in small Mason jars. They are really good. We disclosed to the manager that we knew one of the original partners of P.F. Chang's -- Philip Chiang (yes, there is an 'i' in his last name). His mother started the Mandarin in San Francisco. Philip ran the Mandarin in Beverly Hills and later started Mandarette Cafe on Beverly Blvd. in L.A. Quite a lineage! Manager Jason told me that Philip is involved as a consultant for the corporation that now runs P.F. It's a good thing because I thought on my last visit (after the corporation took over) the food wasn't the same -- too salty and spicy. Philip is back, so now we will be back. Philip is an artist, so I think his design sensibilities might be evident in the interior design of the new Cerritos location.",90703

They always given me my drink and she didn't even bother to ask if it was for me or not. And it just gets better!!  So the total came out to be $4.93 and I gave Carmen $10. She placed my change with the receipt on the counter top. When I opened it I only got $5.05 back when I should be getting 2more pennies  ($5.07). I told her I am missing 2 pennies and right away she was like ""Do you have change?"" -_____-  SHE KNEW she gave me LESS money but she didn't even bother to let me know!!! If she let me know I would have said ""hey it's okay because it's only 2 pennies"".  From the beginning she should have asked me ""I am sorry but do you have change because we do not have any pennies right now?""  Anyways I just let them keep the change but honestly, all of this wouldn't have mattered if she was friendly. Her tone of voice and attitude wasn't friendly at all!!! I really hope she wasn't the manager because her service was horrible!!! I will not be going to P.F.

My experience was a double edge sword because the waitress Megan was nice and attentive (AT FIRST) however, she forgot to put the order through so we waited about 45mins for our main entrees to arrive. She said the manager took some items off the bill, he only took off an appetizer. Not even an apology. After that, Megans attitude towards us changed as if she expected a small tip so there was no need to be nice any more. For a guest to feel that way, it's a pretty nasty feeling when I am paying for service. The food isn't worth the price either.  I can separate service from food but there was little to go by.  We also wanted to use a free entree coupon we had to be applied to a dish of our choosing but she applied it to the cheapest entree on the ticket when I wrote on the receipt to apply it to the lobster/shrimp rice. Often time I experience faulty service and not blame the server because it might be the chef or just overall too busy but there was no excuse for this kind of treatment. It's a shame.

The meal was delicious and the servings huge. We ended taking some of it home. I want to thank Jason and Marriah for making this an unforgettable experience.

We went on 7/25 around 7pm and sat at the bar. My fiancé asked the bartender how a specific beer was, and he replied with ""what do you mean how is it?"" We were expecting his opinion about the beer, but it took him a while. We ordered and right after we got our drinks the female bartender that was there gave us the bill. I'm sorry, but that was just rude. That made us feel so unwelcome and unwanted. Don't bring the bill unless we ask for it and are ready to leave. We were planning on getting more drinks, but not after that. Anyways, we get our food and not ONCE did any of the bartenders come and ask us how everything was, or if they can get us anything else. I put my card next to the bill but I had to get it and take it to the host, only to have the host take it back to the bartender. The female bartender gave me my card and turned around. She didn't even say ""thank you"" or ""thanks for coming in"" I expected better service and for my first time. We were so disappointed and won't be coming back.",90703

The first time it was great there was a bit of a wait but, they were accommodating and the service was awesome. We had a lovely dinner out on the patio and while it was a little drizzling and cold the heater were sufficiently warm to keep it comfortable and honestly it was a full house. Not so much last night. We called ahead to see on the wait it was 15-20 minutes at 6:00 for two. We got there half an hour later to be told 45- hour ?!? Wtf?! We had plans and could not wait that long.  Plus we were totally craving veggie lettuce wraps and coconut curry veggies. Oh well. There were Way less people than the last time we were here and obvious open tables. Reservations held for tables out on the patio ok cool but, there are other 2-4 seater tables open inside. We got Eye rolls and so we left. I'm not sure why it seems that the younger generation does not feel like they need to have manners. Especially when dealing with the public. We were hungry and disappointed. It feels like they were purposely creating ""the wait "" not like there actually needed to be one. And, when people are talking to you don't fake smile then turn your back to us because You're done talking or are talking with your co-workers. It's rude.

So my first thought was to get P.F. Chang's catering platters. I ordered 3 plates. The crispy chicken, lo Mein noodles and chicken lettuce wraps. I requested to have the food ready at 5:45. I had company over so I asked my husband to pick it up. He arrived at the location and unfortunately there was no curbside parking. Due to holiday hours he was driving around for 25 minutes(Which made him late and was not there to surprise my mom) when he picked up the food the take out employee asked if he would like sauces. My husband said yes please give me any sauce that comes with these meals. When my husband got home and we laid out the food we were missing the lettuce for the wraps and there was no sauce at all. Right after I called to let them know and they said they would refund me since I could not go back since we were in the middle of entertaining and I wasn't about to wait to find parking for 25 more minutes. While eating the food I noticed my guest complaining about the lettuce wraps. They were saying it didn't look like chicken lettuce wraps. I looked at the receipt and they we veggie lettuce wraps. Not only did they not give me lettuce they also gave me the wrong order. I paid a lot of money for the whole meal and the only thing my mom likes was ruined. I really wanted to make my moms 60th birthday special since it only happens once and I feel like this put a damper  on it. I will never order the catering services from P.F. Chang's again.",90703

A waiter would come take your order.  After waiting about 20 -30 minutes, they brought me the wrong order.  I waited longer and my order was finally brought to me.  Their credit card machine was down so they used the old-time credit card sliding machine with the duplicate paper copies.  While I was waiting for my order and sitting near the kitchen, I noticed complete chaos in the restaurant.  There were way too many servers.  Many of them were asking each other where certain table numbers were located.  I saw servers wandering around with trays of food not knowing where to go.  Some even went back to the kitchen with the food.  Many customers were just sitting at tables looking very unhappy because they had obviously been waiting a long time for their food.  I will continue to enjoy the Anaheim PF Chang's until the one in Cerritos gets its act together!",90703

The reason we've not returned since was pretty much justified after today's meal. This restaurant essentially serves American Chinese fast food cuisine at high sit-down-cloth-napkin prices. The restaurant was comfortable and the no-touch QR menu was considerate. (This is essentially a Panda Inn with higher prices.) We finally came back to eat here because we were given $100 worth of gift cards. We ordered: lobster dumplings in miso-butter sauce (6 dumplings for $15), Chang's spicy chicken ($19), Crispy Honey chicken ($18), Pepper Steak ($19), Shrimp with Lobster Sauce ($19), a couple of iced teas (@$3.50). There were lunch portions of some of the entrees available for about 2/3 of the cost of the full-sized orders; we were told by our waiter that the food portion was almost a third of the full-sized. Service was attentive until we got our food. Then the bus boy/man pretty much saw that we were waiting after we were done eating and offered us to go boxes and he seemed more interested in us - kudos to him! Nonetheless, we hope the tips are generously shared with this hardworking gentleman!So, food wise, the clear winner was the lobster dumpling  dish, albeit pricey, had a delicious sauce and good amount of lobster meat in each of the dumplings. It set off the meal well. However, the other dishes, particularly the chicken dishes, were unremarkable, to the point of boring - they were breaded chicken pieces with sauce, and ever so slightly garnished with a few slivers of scallions, served directly and starkly on black dishes. The honey chicken (maybe their version of General Tso?) was on a bed of deep fried rice noodles. Taste wise - mild (kinder than ""bland"") and not crispy. Maybe the fried rice noodles were the crispy part? The spicy chicken had a little more character, but essentially the same thing but with a slightly sweet-spicy sauce. The pepper beef was perhaps the tastiest of the mains we ordered, with tenderised beef slices with peppers and onions. The anticipated shrimp in lobster sauce was a little disappointing - but palatable like the other dishes. It was an unimaginative monochromatic brown/yellow dish of medium shrimp + sliced mushroom + water chestnuts in a clear garlicky sauce with egg. The plus here was the generous amount of rice that came with the meal - both white and brown. Our bill came to $106 and change. Two stars for the entrees, plus one for the lobster dumplings and the bus boy.",91367

The ambiance was okay (nothing super-special), and the waiter was attentive (although he shouted and startled me every time he appeared...which was usually behind my right shoulder).Details:- Orange chicken: overpoweringly orange, with a LOT of sauce and mushy breading on the chicken.- Beef and broccoli: The beef had a vaguely fishy taste and we all guessed it was cooked in fish oil. The broccoli florets were odd in that the flower portions were super-soft (not mushy), but the stem portions were crunchy.- Kung Pow Chicken: This was actually really good.- Vegetable Chow Mein: For the price of nothing but noodles and veggies, this was a small dish and nearly flavorless.Before the meal was done, we all agreed that the food quality and taste at Panda Express was better. This is bad when a fancy restaurant can't even match the quality of a mall food-court food service. Especially when the fancy restaurant easily costs three or four times what the fast-food place does.PF Chang's simply isn't good enough to warrant their high prices, and we are not likely to return.",91367

Chang's has stood the test of time.  For now at least.  We sat on the patio (no inside dinning right now).  It was really nice.  They have some fans blowing to combat the 100 August afternoon.  The wait staff is all masked up, some with face shields too.  Service was good!Had to get the pan fried shrimp dumplings.  Good like always.  Wife only wanted 2 so that's 4 for me : )  We split the Mandarin Crunch Salad aka Chinese Chicken Salad.  It was fresh cool and hit the spot.  Plenty to split.We also did the Mongolian Beef entree size ($20.00).  Looking back on it, the lunch size ($13.00) would have been just fine.  Really tasty.  Say what you want about this Americanized Chinese food but this was good!

Had reservations, still waited 20min. Had to ask for refills, fine.. COVID times, server was busy, they're short staffed .. etc etc ..  but there's only so much you can forgive before a bad night turns into a .. 'we should've stayed home..' kinda night. Appetizers came, lettuce for chicken wraps didn't come until the food was cold to even wrap and eat it. The main course took forever to arrive when it did .. it was barely luke warm. The plate was plenty hot from sitting under the warmers in the kitchen .. but the food was just cold.. if I'm paying $20 a dish I want HOT food. Not too much to ask right? Appetizer dishes were never cleared so when the main course came, the server was asking us to move empty dirty plates around so we can make room for the main course. I asked  our server (who was extremely busy with 6 other tables) and another server to clear the dishes and she said ok and walked away to greet her next table.. wtf?! So much for team work... Called manager over, he seemed overwhelmed as well, never apologized and just rushed to have the dishes remade .. ok fine. Low and behold, out of nowhere the busser appears and wants to clear our dishes.. not sure where he was the rest of the night... I wouldn't let him take the cold food until our hot food came because I don't know if they're just gonna reheat it and bring it right back.. who knows.. Anyway, long story short they even missed a salad we had ordered that never came and later I checked the bill and of course we were charged for it.

The chicken was definitely on the dry side. On a better note the fried rice in itself was palatable. Neither soggy nor hard. My secret to at least ingesting this entree along with most, was the Chinese hot oil, and Chinese mustard. (Which I had to request, they would have normally been part of the table setting).What blew me away was when Chris, our server delivered the requested condiments, the bottles were about 95 % empty - (See photo).The Mongolian beef had a bland flavor to it, apart from being on the dry side. My recollection from their menu stated this dish is identified as spicy. Far far from spicy and usually flavorful. That was noticeably quite contrary from what was experienced today.Once again the diminimus sauce element provided enough heat to make this entree palatable.On a better note, their honey walnut shrimp was on point, flavorful, and made just right. However, the melon balls that came with this dish had a hard / tough texture to the bite, indicating the melon fruit used had not ripened fully for consumption. I just skipped the melons altogether after the initial bite.And finally, the chicken lettuce wrap was a tad dry, and lacked flavor. Once again noticed the diminimus portions provided today. There used to be an abundance of full lettuce leaves with more than adequate fillings for this dish. That was not the case this afternoon. I purposely did not order an alcohol infused beverage to enable give this review a realistic rating as opposed to my previous review,  yet,  sad to say there were no noticeable differences insofar as flavor, portions, nor a semblance the entrees freshly made.Management is encouraged to up their game as PF Chang's used to be my go to establishment for Chinese fusion not too long ago. I must have patronized you guys with at least 75 visits prior to this year. That may now change.The reason I provided this establishment with three stars was because Chris, our server was very attentive.  Always checking on how we were doing, providing beverage refills, and just being all around personable. (Perhaps he should be the one training your wait staff after 15 years of service with your resto.) Kudos Chris, great job! You definitely made a great impression and may have curbed my thought process to offer 3 stars for today's  dining experience. (I have posted Chris' picture as well). My rating this experience would have been a generous 2 stars.Sorry guys, bottom line, I would have provided you with a two star rating but for your hero, Chris. I earnestly hope he gets way up in your corporate ladder. He deserves it!!!On a lighter more positive note, adequate  parking within their lot at noon on on a Sunday.

I showed up for Valentine's Day to have a great meal with my wife and I'm presented with a reduced item menu. At least half of the menu items have been abandoned.  The menu has a bistro feel to it. And not in a good way.  To my wife's disappointment, the Orange Peel chicken was taken off the new menu. This was her favorite and has been for years. How does a Chinese style restaurant get rid of the most popular item?!The food itself was a bit bland and fairly forgettable. There are still items that I love and I'll most likely going to continue to go there but with the competition for my dining dollars P.F. Chang's really blew it with my family.",91367

With a 5:45 reservation we gave them 30 minutes and then were told another 30. We were told their reservations take priority over open table. At 6:15 we were told it would be another 30 minutes. We are trying to support our restaurants but if they are nt willing to accommodate a reservation within a reasonable time then maybe they shouldn't take reservations during covid. The manager Brian was ZERO help. You would think and offer of water or a drink. Nope! Best part was they also told us they wouldn't honor their happy hour because we wouldn't be seated before 6. Then after questioning him he said he would honor one. Thanks Bri Guy! What a bummer that this place treats long loyal customers this way.,91367

I haven't been here in years as last time I dined I had one of the managers laugh when I noted a food allergy to her. The experience was terrible and made me never want to return to this location. However I was in the area this week and decided to give them a second try several years later.Upon entering the restaurant I put my name down and was told it would be about a 20 minute wait. I was a bit confused why as no one was waiting and there were plenty of open tables but I took a seat and waited. When it was time for us to get seated we were escorted to a small booth on the right side and given our menus. My friend and I sat there patiently waiting for a server to come greet us or take our drink orders but no one came. We watched as people that got seated after us were all being helped yet no one approached our table. We even tried calling over a few waiters who mad eye contact with us but just ignored us. After about twenty minutes I finally went back up to the host stand and expressed my frustration. The host apologized and said we definitely should have already gotten helped. He stated he would inform a manager right away for them to come speak with us. But guess what - that NEVER happened. Instead we got a waitress that came over that wasn't present at all when talking to us. She constantly was looking around and focusing on her other tables. She quickly rushed through our orders and left. The food arrived after a bit of a wait but we didn't even have silverware. Again we had to try and track down a waiter to get some. Once we got her attention she brought over silverware and in a rude manor expressed ""is there anything else"". The whole experience made us feel very unwelcome at this restaurant.It's a shame how other locations can do such a great job but this one on two occasions years apart has failed both times. I will not be returning and hope others choose to visit their multiple different locations instead of this one.",91367

Think of it as an upscale version of Mongolian Beef. Trust me, its good!Lastly, we tried a new dish: Chicken Pad Thai. We tried this because they have daily specials for $10. Today's special was the Pad Thai. It had all the ingredients of a traditional Pad Thai dish. The chicken was crispy which makes me think they may have fried it a little first before putting in all the ingredients, which was perfect because it didn't leave a soggy texture - if that makes sense. The service was great. We were greeted immediately once we entered and exited. Our server was delightful at this location. That is not always the case is some locations. I gave it a 4 stars instead of 5 because the prices were a little high. For the three dishes alone, it came out to $45 and that is with the daily special.",91367

It was pretty busy and their front door situation should be remodeled as no customer wanted to sit near the entrance due to the freezing air that would burst through the door as people entered/exited. I requested to be seated away from the door since I had a small. The hostess became snappy because of my request saying I'll have to sit wherever there is seating since no one wants to sit near the entrance. To keep calm I just walked away as she continued to tell me she couldn't accommodate my request. After being seated as far away from the door as possible, our server came to the table and we ordered drinks. I dont remember her name but she was really nice and helpful. She did a great job at maintaining the positive energy established. Since we already knew what we wanted to eat we ordered the spicy orange chicken, chow mein, beef broccoli and a new item the mongolian dumpling as an appetizer. The food: The appetizer Mongolian beef was pretty bland, just meat in a dumpling wrap with a weird after taste.Chow mein: was equally as sad as the appetizer. It taste like noodles and peanut oil. My toddler didnt even want anymore after a few bites. And he loves every kind of noodle,  especially italian and chinese food. Orange chicken was the worst. It was pan seared chicken pieces tossed in what looked like dole mandarin fruit cups in heavy syrup, red chili peppers and sugar. But it wasnt spicy like we asked.Beef and broccoli seemed to be the only thing that taste half way decent. All in all I took it as their attempt to be an ""healthier"" alternative to chinese food. And that's a stretch but I cant figure out why everything was extremely flavorless other than them catering to the aging population who may not be able to eat seasoned food. While I dont remember having such a poor dining experience in prior years hopefully I'll remember to never return this time. There's too many other places out here to settle for this and its cost. Sadly the waitress was shocked that we said the food was good after she braced for the worst after hesitantly asking our opinion of the food. Newly noted in Google to never return.",91367

I like the restaurant much more before they cut their menu in half in February. They should also have more fans for their outdoor seating because that is the only seating they offer and it's 100 degrees. My Mongolian beef was very low quality meat and the amount of sauce it was served with was underwhelming to say the least.

CRISPY HONEY CHICKEN = battered chicken in a honey sauce, served on a bed of crispy rice noodles.  Chicken is always juicy on the inside.STIR-FRIED EGGPLANT = moist, tender eggplant in a sweet chili glaze.  Just as flavorful as the meat dishes.BEEF A LA SICHUAN = not nearly as spicy as the menu would lead you to believe.  I am a spice weakling and even I think that the heat is quite mild.  Strips of flank steak are caramelized in a sweet peppery sauce to the point that I consider them as MEAT CANDY.  Mixed with lots of green onion and veggie strips, though I wish these were cut smaller since they can be difficult to eat. All employees from the hostess stand to the servers are very welcoming and friendly.  They understand that most of the clientele are employees in the area and do their best to get you out within the standard lunch hour.Location is along Oxnard St between Topanga Canyon Blvd & Owensmouth.  Look across the street from the Marriott in the Warner Center area.",91367

I also reached out to the Senior Manager and have not heard back, so I thought posting a review would make the most sense. Last week I ordered lunch on 3 seperate occasions and requested that all meals be made spicy.  On all 3 occasions, my food items were not only inedible, but arrived swimming in chili paste and Sriracha sauce. What I don't understand is why a chef would even let those items go out and be served to their customers. I would truly be embarrassed to offern my customers a meal that was not executed correctly. The last item I ordered was the Honey Chicken Bowl and when I opened up the package, and this is not an exaggeration, the whole meal was a combined soupy mass of fried rice, broccoli, carrots, soggy honey chicken and an exorbitant amount of chili paste and sauce. It lacked any flavor, was  embarrassing to look at and inedible. I really expected more from P. F. Changs and these last visits were truly disappointing!",91367

Made a reservation, now usually our table is ready and waiting, not last night we had to wait about 20 minutes. Next we waited about 15 minutes before anyone came to wait on us. No silverware or napkins asked for and only after our appetizer arrived. Our main dishes arrived before our appetizer and soup, we sent them back where I am sure they were placed under a heat lamp because when they came back they were luke warm. I specially asked fro them to be remade but were not.Soup and appetizer came at the same time. When we finished with them no one came to pick up our dirty dishes, all the dishes just piled up. After waiting until we were half way through our mains we called over a buss boy and asked him to remove them, the two buss boys were just standing around and talking and checking their phones. When they had to clean a table across from us they berely got the dishes off and NO  SANITIZING took place at all or floor sweeping all kinds of stuff was on the floor under the table, for the next guest to step on, no one checked. Bill came and was wrong of course, why am I not surprised, no fortune cookies delivered, by this time we just wanted to GET OUT!Our waiter was trying very hard but he seemed to be over worked too many tables, he tried but still a lot to go wrong with our meal, and the worst part was that when all these things were brought up the management they seem to be ignored.Will try one more time at a different PF Chang's and see if things are different.",91367

I have now been here two times in the past month for take out and I must say I have been impressed with not only the portions, but the fact that when I call the customer service line it's a person at the restaurant and not a third party which is what it seemed to be before but not anymore.

On Saturday, Nov. 2, 2019, in the evening, my husband and I decided to have dinner at this establishment. We pulled into the parking lot to take a handicapped space with our permanent handicapped license plates on our vehicle when this little punk in an overpriced car that thought he was the only person on earth zoomed in front of us and took the space.Unfortunately, we had to park quite a distance away. As we walked by the car, we confronted the idiot that was on the passenger side, he was as useless as a flea, apparently high on something. We then went into the takeout side of the restaurant, where I confronted this worthless human being, which he was less than man enough to even look at me. The coward!We proceeded to see the manager of the restaurant, Amy, who was little to no help what so ever. We explained our dilemma, and she responded that she couldn't police the parking lot! REALLY!!! We didn't ask her to police it. We asked her to say something to the idiot, such as we have a complaint from another patron about the handicapped space you took. Call him out on the carpet. Simple and easy. She took the easy way out and threw us under the bus. She said nothing at all to him. Amy, as a manager, you should have done something to defuse the situation. Instead, you let down a vocal patron. A mistake!Frankly, P.F. Chang's, your food is marginal, management is less than adequate, and the only thing I will give you one star on is our server. However, P.F.Chang's, you had nothing to do with that either since she was doing her job.Good riddance to bad rubbish!",91367

Chang's is like the Olive Garden of Chinese food--there's nothin' authentic about it. There's only a few locations, it's not bad, it's not great, which means there's most certainly better options but they're probably a lot further and you don't feel like making the trip all the way to the other side of town... so you settle.I'm not the settling type, but my mom insisted on taking me out to dinner here so here we are!First we ordered the chicken wrap as a starter but it arrived as a vegetarian wrap. We tasted nothing but lettuce and heavily sauteed diced water chestnuts. Faaantastic!And shame on me for ordering sushi from a barely-Chinese restaurant, but my curiosity got the best of me! This ""sushi roll"" was heavy on the COLD RICE and had barely a squirt of lobster in my so-called lobster avocado roll, drenched in their aioli sauce. Listen, no amount of sauce could take away from that atrocity. Market sushi is better than this shit.The salt and pepper prawns run $20 a plate and you're served with 10 pieces at $2 a *shrimp. There's no way those tiny babies were ""prawns"". I wish I took a picture at what the plate looked like when it arrived at our table. There was a huge empty gap in the center... like it literally looked like some other table's left overs.The beef fried rice looked greasier than a Pizza Hut pan pizza. But at least it tasted good, I guess.Overall I'm not exactly disappointed because this is exactly what I expected. 2 stars for proving me right, P.F. Chang's.

The customer service is rapid, amazing, and always on top of things. One thing I really like is their great happy hour deals, great for a quick visit after work.

Chang's frequently.  I made dinner plans for New Year's Day. My choices were between Ruth's Chris, Davenport's and P.F. Chang's.  I chose P.F. Chang's. My reservation was for 8:00 p.m.  When I walked in the door the hostess, rather than greeting me, advised me that they could seat me but it would take one to one and 1/2 hours before we could eat because two of their cooks walked out. Being that I drove a distance to get there, I decided to stay. After being seated we placed our order. We ordered their new calamari appetizer, Chang's chicken, Mongolian beef, rice and noodles. 10 mins after placing our order, the waiter returned to advise us that they had run out of chicken. I reluctantly ordered a shrimp dish instead. As expected, the order took exceedingly long to arrive. When it finally did everything came out at one time except for the calamari, which should have been the first thing to arrive.  When the waiter came back to our table, I asked him where our calamari was. It was at that point (more than one hour after arriving and ordering) that he advised us that they had run out. Was anyone planning to tell us?? The food we did receive was disgusting. The shrimp were soggy with absolutely zero crisp to them. The Mongolian beef tasted like rubber. The rice and noodles had absolutely no taste.  Panda Express would have been better!  When it came time to paying the bill I provided my rewards number so that I could get the points. I had also earned a free entree. The manager took it upon herself to apply my free entree reward towards the bill without asking me if that's what I wanted to do. I asked the waiter if I could speak to the manager because the receipt failed to show an itemization of charges, so I wasn't able to determine which dish she applied the free entree towards. I wanted to make sure the free entree was used towards the Mongolian beef or shrimp rather than the less expensive side items.  Instead of the manager coming out and explaining what she had done, and apologizing for the horrible experience we just had, she sent the waiter back with the full bill, not deducting the free entree I had earned. I was so annoyed by this time I paid the bill and left. Very poor management. Unprofessional staff and not the type of experience you would expect on New Year's Day! I wish I had gone to Ruth's Chris or Davenport's instead. Even Panda Express would have been a better choice.",91367

Changs on Topanga Canyon Blvd  in Woodland Hills and this location continued to come up in the search. I'm going to take it that I have the right location. It is next to an AMC 16 theater and the Marriott hotel is across the street. This should do it as for as providing landmarks. I hadn't been to a P.F. Changs in a long time, but I always remembered it as having fresh ingredients. This is not your Mama's chinese restuarant! Before I go on lets give the brown rice a moment of silence. I don't really like brown rice, but DANG! P.F. Changs that brown rice is incredible ! That's saying a lot because I honestly I eat brown rice because it's suppose to be healthier ...blah, bah , blah. Well I don't need gravy for this rice.  Myself inner voice kept talking to me...stop eating the rice. Moving on to the rest of the experience. The ambiance is always low lighting and very calming with the battery operated candles on each table. What a nice touch. I ordered sesame chicken, mixed veggies and that dang good ol' brown freaking rice! The mixed veggies had red bell pepper which gave the veggies a little punch. I had water and a small glass of Merlot red wine. Don't tell my mommy her baby girl drank some wine. Shhh! It was a small glass and I'm not a drinker. I can't even call myself a social drinker. Anyway I don't have any knowledge of wines, but it wasn't bad. If it didn't leave a bad taste on my palate, then it was alright to me. The Mister had walnut chicken , broccoli and brown rice. To drink he had a coconut mojito. It looked really pretty. He enjoyed his meal as well. The waitress was very friendly. She teased me while I was trying to use the chop sticks. I tired a few times then I was done. We drove around the city a little and in so much traffic, I was starving. I couldn't play with those chop sticks anymore. It was a great experience. I didn't check out the ladies room to see if it were tidy, but the place over all looked presentable enough as for as I could see. I took some of my food back to my hotel to eat for breakfast. I love eating non traditional food for breakfast. Let me tell you it was delicious the next day. The flavors seemed to settle and it was really good.

Every time we needed something, we had to Summons her or her colleagues. When our food came out appetizer was lukewarm but I did not complain. When the main courses came out, the Lo-Mein that we had gone into detail about but she failed to write down our order and omitted our request, came out with NO SAUCE. Opposed to extra sauce. We had to ask another waiter to get Jade to come to the table and when she did she seemed annoyed again. No apology NOTHING. When the manager came over, she had the same stoic nonchalant attitude about the issue and did not apologize either.

I avoided this chain for most my life but recently started working near one, so I have to pop in every once in a while with some coworkers. The food is rather strange. I had some variety of the chicken, kung po I think and it just felt to dense. Like they compressed the chicken and I was eating a piece that would usually be 3 times the size. I am grateful for the protein packed meal but it wasn't pleasant to chew and had below average mouth feel. I ordered some white rice in order to at least have a filling meal and it still bothers me that a restaurant that serves asian food would charge so much for a side of white rice. This isn't panda express where the margins are minuscule - this is a mid-class restaurant. The wait is also pretty bad. The waiter kept refilling my drink and checking in every few minutes which is what saves this place from 2 stars (the hospitality here is always great).

First off, let me say the bar service was good. Only thing in the restaurant that was, but it was. Came at happy hour, ordered spring rolls and sake. Sake was nice and hot, and spring rolls flavorful.2. Then dinner. The restaurant was practically empty, so we got seated, and waited. And waited. And waited. No crowds and plenty of waitstaff, and others who arrived later got waited on and served, but I guess they dont do older people. Either that or we Had stumbled on Harry Potter's invisibility cloak. Anyway, after like 30 minutes, someone FINALLY took our order. He did apologize, to his credit.3. The food. We ordered the crab wanton, some potstickers and the avocado rolls. I kid you not, they were greasy, tough and tasteless. Which is fine, except for the prices they were asking.

So instead we went to P.F. Chang's, where it took over 20 mins to be seated, when there was at least a dozen empty tables. I don't understand why the wait was necessary, but we finally got seated and right away I explained to the waiter that we were limited on time and are going to order at one single time to speed the process. The food wasn't up to par it was average, and the beef Mongolian was dry. One key point that really that took my experience over the edge was that I ordered a California roll which took forever to come to my table. When it finally did we were ready to leave, but being that the manager personally brought it and apologized for the long wait I figured he may just waive the California roll off my order. Surprisingly when our check arrived I was billed for everything. It's ok but I should of canceled the California roll because it was terrible it was nothing what I expected, I have never waited for a sushi roll that, to be that terrible.

The ends and the edges were still on there hard to take off when they are cooked. Sweet and sour chicken beaded more seasoning. It was too bland. Complimentary white rice was way to over cooked and it was cooked to the point where it was getting mushy. Broccoli beef was too salty too much soy sauce and salt added. Lo main was over cooked and the peas snap peas like I mentioned before where not properly cleaned. Also it was missing flavor over all for what I payed it was too expensive for watered down food and drink. The lemonade with mango tea tasted like water.

It was a lot smaller portion wise than it was when I went about a year ago... Also I feel like they put too many water chestnuts as filler not enough chicken. So it was big bites of water chestnuts... And the white crispy stuff tasted stale. As we were sitting there was a taller guy bartender and a brunette bartender ( women need to keep their hair  up please) looked as though they were fighting. She kept calling him jealous and he kept telling her to go wash her hands... You could tell they were annoyed with each other, which... Fine, whatever, but....

Luckily, we arrived 15 minutes before the end of happy hour (6pm) and we're able to take advantage of their bar food at reduced prices.I've been to several of the PF Chang's chains in SoCal and really like the modern upscale dining room which features dark wood tones, comfortable booths, exquisite stone walls and eclectic lighting fixtures in a sophisticated, yet comfortable dining atmosphere. Suitable for casual meals, date night, office get together or any special occasions.We ordered the pork dumplings, chicken lettuce wrap and northern-style spare ribs. Everything was terrific. The chicken lettuce wrap was delicious and on point. The sweet/salty flavors from the minced meat and vegetables, balanced nicely with lettuce.Though large enough for two people to share, I had a hard time letting go of mine! The ribs were surprisingly good too...really tender and flavorful. With exception to the chicken wrap, portions were small unfortunately. We ended up ordering the Mongolian beef and orange chicken. I actually enjoyed PF Chang's Mongolian beef which was well seasoned, not to salty or sweet and very delicious. The perfect companion to steam white rice (brown rice available). The orange chicken was okay. It was more on the sweeter side which I disliked and lacked light crisp exterior. We actually thought about skipping dessert, but when we saw ""select any 3 sweets treats for $7.95"" from their dessert menu, we simply couldn't resist indulging. We ordered the tiramisu, red velvet, and salted caramel cake. And to add to our sugar overload, our server included a complimentary chocolate peanut butter crunch cake. Oh me oh my!!!! Talk about over indulgence. Everyone enjoyed and devoured the chocolate peanut butter crunch cake which was rich, dense and lusciously good. Love crunchy texture and creamy peanut butter/chocolate flavor, reminded me of snicker bar. The salted caramel was terrific as well. Unfortunately, red velvet cake and tiramisu were not up to par and lacking in authenticity and quality. Though some of the items dishes weren't as memorable and appealing, we enjoyed our visit, food was reasonably priced and atmosphere was inviting.

I think it was more dinner than work, but I'm not complaining. The family style approach of P.F. Chang's is perfect for an event like this. Everyone ordered something and then we all passed it around. From appetizer to dessert everything was delicious. Our server, Kelly, did an awesome job handling our group of 14 people! Also, I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of their drinks for a restaurant. I ordered a Mai Thai and it wasn't watered down. Everyone who ordered drinks was feeling good after 1 and that is unusual for a restaurant bar. One of my favorite foods that we tried was the lobster avocado roll. It stands out in my mind as the favorite thing that we tried. Also some of the favorites of the group were Mongolian Beef, Flourless Chocolate Cake, the lettuce wraps and anything with shrimp. However, the chocolate raspberry wontons were underwhelming and so was the Chang's Lobster rice. Everything else, though, was pretty good.  We definitely all recommend this place for big groups when you are in the area and hungry! It's well worth it.

We knew they closed at 11 and didn't want to be ""those customers"" so we rushed over once we decided our cravings needed to be met. Was not on the ball and didn't make note of any names, but everyone was pleasant enough. We were seated promptly after entering, didn't seem very busy. Our waitress was Angie (she never introduced herself, I had to check the receipt) and she also, was nice enough, but her service fell short. Maybe it was because we came in towards closing? It's all good, I'll still come and eat here, just earlier I suppose. Ordered an appetizer of the lettuce wraps as soon as I could make eye contact with a busboy, those wraps are my jam... my lady jam. I think I ate like 7? It seems like such an appropriate amount at first and then after eating a few, I was just amazed at how much was still left on the plate. I ate it all though, that good. I use to come here every year for my birthday, but the wraps aren't enough to keep me coming once a year. It's expensive American Chinese food and I'd rather spend my money in Chinatown DTLA. We ordered vegetable fried rice and the beef á la Sichuan, and I got a cup of the egg drop soup. Soup was delicious! Fried rice was okay, was a bit eggy and needed salt. Beef was yummy, although very crisp to the point that it hurt my mouth. The heat crept up on you, it's all in the juice and gets you once you've finished your bite. Soak up some of the rice with the hot beef sauce/juice and you've got a winning combination. Overall yummy and I left feeling full. Oh, and to the couple across a few tables, canoodling and mad dogging my boyfriend and I all night, get a f**king life and maybe drink less, you looked a bit tore up.",91367

Nearly every time we visit we end up returning a dish (undercooked shrimp, soggy egg rolls, unsweetened Mongolian beef, etc.) this is one of the most inconsistent chains we've been to. During our last visit I ordered pad Thai and noticed that I had trouble finding the noodles (the main reason why I ordered the dish). I realized that the small amount of the noodles were are micro sized (smaller than the bean sprouts). I asked the server if they changed the noodles and he said no and asked if I would like a new one and I did. Shortly after the manager (a blond woman) came out with my dish asking if something was wrong with it. I explained the noodle situation and showed her the noodles on my plate and told her they were tiny noodles. She responded saying ""I don't know about that, but we can make you a new one"".

We were seated at 6:15pm and ordered right away. I am writing this review as we are seated at the restaurant, it's 7:46pm we still have not received our food. The wait staff advised that the restaurant is very behind because they ran a take out promotion so their kitchen is backed up. It took ten minutes to receive our drinks, still no food. The waitress was really trying her best but what is she to do, the kitchen is backed up. We are not sure when we will get our food...hopefully sometime this evening. The good news is the egg rolls we did get were tasty and my passion fruit ice tea is pretty good too. I would suggest holding off on visiting if they run take out promotions. In house guests are put on the back burner because apparently they don't believe in staffing their restaurant properly when they run promotions. I think if they were better at managing expectations, or even offered an apology we would not be as disappointed, the repeated response continues to be the kitchen is backed up because of the promotion, no apology offered. I forgot to mention, wait staff dropped a drink on the floor, the table next to us were the ones warning people to be careful, then after about 5 minutes they put their napkins on the spill and eventually cleaned it up. The staff did eventually come to clean but our neighbors were key in making sure no one got hurt.Update on the review: I changed to one star, our food arrived at 7:58pm, 3 of the orders came incorrectly, crispy honey chicken was ordered, they brought orange chicken, the sushi ordered was ordered with no shellfish for allergies, it came with crab, the rice was ordered as brown, it came as white and brown mixed. I asked if I can order something else, they said they can't rush anything so it would be another hour. She apologized and advised that two of the cooks walked out. Interesting dining experience, thankfully dining mates were willing to share and I ordered an appetizer because that is the only thing they could bring with minimal wait time. I would recommend ordering take out, the food is good but clearly in house guests are not this restaurants priority.

My uncle decided to take us here while we were staying with them for the weekend. It was the day after Christmas, so we knew it was going to be busy. We knew it was going to be packed and we knew the wait time was going to be insane. We got there and of course, it was a 45 minute wait, but we looked around and there were other tables that were empty, so my uncle said ""let's go, let's go somewhere else"" and as we're returning the little buzzer, the waitress changed the time to ""10 minutes"" so we decided to stay. They knew it was going to be a big bill, since there were 7 of us. 10 minutes rolled around and we weren't seated and people who came in after us were seated before us, again, we decided to leave and that's when they decided to seat us. We saw a lot of open tables too, so it was no excuse, my uncle was angry and spoke to the guy in the tie, he seemed to be the supervisor. So right there, they were dropped to 2 stars. We got seated and the waiter was clearly stressed and frazzled by how busy they were. He took our drinks order and took awhile to come back. My uncle again, had to ask another waitress what was taking him with our waters, teas and wine. She told him that he was back there making the tea. He came back with the drinks but never took our order, so again, my uncle had to call for him, at this point, we're looking at 1 1/2 stars with the service.Finally he came back and took our orders and the food came out fast, he refilled our teapots, the appetizers came out first to hold over my daughter who was clearly starving and upset. We got the vegetarian dumplings and the pork dumplings for appetizers, both are really good. At this point, back up to 2 1/2 stars. The food came out with pork fried rice, beef and broccoli, tofu and broccoli, honey crisp shrimp, and a side of brown rice, we got two plates of each. Everything was really good, it was on the lazy susan for us to spin around and share. The pork fried rice wasn't with bbq pork, but it was still good. We all got quiet because we were busy eating and were happy at this point. Back up to 3 stars. Then he comes out and asks if everything was ok, he got us refills of our drinks and our plates of beef and broccoli and tofu and broccoli and left. Back up to 3 1/2 stars.When we told him we were ready for the bill, he came out with a huge side piece of chocolate cake with some fruit and a candle, compliments of the restaurant for the slow service. He also told us he got such a big piece since there's so many of us and a lot of times, people want some too, so he didn't want to get a small piece. There were a big piece of it left since we were so full and the cake was so rich and dense, we couldn't eat much of it.

Now, you're probably saying to yourself, how can you possibly go wrong when his name is on this restaurant. Well, I've been dining at P.F. Changs now for a little over 8 years, on a pretty consistent basis. The food and the drinks at one point in time were good enough for me to keep it in my 'Chinese' rotation so to speak. Unfortunately, I've finally came to a realization that the standard of this restaurant is slowly but surely deteriorating. So my boyfriend and I came on Friday for Chinese take out/movie night. We phoned in our order so that we can speed up the waiting process, knowing the restaurant would be packed especially on a Friday night. This is a very busy location, being situated outside of Promenade Mall/AMC theatre. The items we ordered :double pan fried noodles with chicken - usually this item was my favorite, however it was EXTREMELY salty, almost inedible. low mien with chicken - very bland, no major flavor profile. Vanilla ice cream has more flavor. almond and cashew chicken - this was the only enjoyable item we had that night. There was plenty of chicken and the sauce actually was good. We also had brown rice to accompany it, which was cooked perfectly. Another issue I have with this establishment now, is the rewards card they offer. My family and I order at least once or twice a Month, and I've yet to see ANY type of incentive or reward. Isn't that was a 'REWARD' Card is for? P.F. Changs was once my 'go-to' Chinese restaurant.

My buddy has a lot of food allergies so there was considerable limitations in what he could order.Ambience: the setting is almost identical to other PF Chang restaurants that I have been in. When you walk in, there is a center hostess station with large open rooms on either side. A very simple but elegant decor. The restaurant itself is situated on the periphery of a shopping mall that is in the process of closing. The good news is that the parking lot is fairly empty and there is ample free parking nearby.Service: our server, Rachel, was absolutely amazing. She came by almost immediately after we were seated and made us feel very welcome and comfortable. She was able to get information from the chef regarding the ingredients of dishes so that my friend could order without worrying about an allergic reaction to a hidden item in one of the dishes he ordered. In fact, when the food runner brought the food to the table, she realized that one of the dishes was not proper and had it brought back to the kitchen to be remade so that it would be safe then to eat.Food: this was the weakest part of the night. We started with the wonton soup. The wonton soup was bland and nearly flavorless. The wontons themselves were actually quite tasty but were not enough to carry this otherwise mediocre dish. We had mongolian beef. This was dried out and not very flavorful. We had an almond chicken dish that was incredibly bland. We also had the shrimp with lobster sauce. Again best described as meh.In summary, service 5 stars, ambience 4 stars, food 2 stars. This is supposed to be an upscale Chinese restaurant.

I wonder if the place is closing, like the rest of the Promenade Mall, and they just don't care anymore?One visit, the server left the restaurant after taking our order! To her credit, the duty manager took care of us.During our most recent visit, the order was not done correctly (not the first time this has happened; Cook staff is either over-worked or just not good enough to deliver on the menu). The waiter had quite the attitude about him; we were glad to leave. The kicker is that after we submitted a critique via the receipt code process, no one from the restaurant followed-up (You know there's problems with a restaurant when there's no follow-up). Whatever the case, this PF Chang's in Woodland Hills just seems to be going through the motions and doesn't care anymore about food quality or service. Sad!",91367

The restaurant was not in a horribly busy state. There were people dining here but it was nowhere near crowded. The service was highly lacking. My server did check on me after I got my food. Where I ended up being unhappy is how it took more than 25 minutes to pay and get out of there. I had to get back to work. It's excessive to take such a long time to bring my check after I've requested it and then have to wait all over again after I've put my credit card in so she can pick it up and bring it back to me for tip and signature.  When she finally came to bring the check to me, I think I was visibly not pleased due to the extensive wait, but not only did she not apologize for taking so long but she also didn't say anything at all. She dropped off the check and walked off. I would've preferred that she apologized for taking so long or acknowledged SOMETHING as I pretty much stared at her with a displeased expression on my face as she walked towards me. I would have preferred that she address that and also not walk away. She should have at least waited for me to put my card in so I didn't have to wait all over again for her to return.",91367

When we asked the waitress why our food was taking so long to arrive, she gave a snarky comment saying ""everyone here is hungry"" and walked off. As we called the manager over, she informed us that the order was only put in 10 minutes ago. Ridiculous!!! The waitress forgot to put in our order AND she was rude.

The beef was over cooked and tough and chicken was also over cooked and dry. Service was fine.

If you are looking for an ""authentic"" Chinese culinary adventure, go somewhere else. You are in Los Angeles and there are plenty of options. If you like the occasional Americanized, chain-restaurant experience, come here. I'm not knocking that, sometimes I enjoy a good chain.So, as a PF Chang's liker, please heed my warning. AVOID THIS LOCATION AT ALL COSTS!!! I have eaten here at least 7 or 8 times, over a 2-3 year time span, and the service is consistently awful. You are probably wondering why I keep going here if the service is so bad. No, it's not the food. Even the tasty food is not enough to make me want to come back to this location. I only come here because other people make me. If it's just me and a friend or two I do whatever is needed to talk them into going ANYWHERE else. But sometimes other people have done the planning and I just don't have a choice.On a good day, the service is just slow and painful. Issues I have encountered here:Bringing out entrees before appetizers and drinks.Forgetting some items completely.Bringing out half of the party's food 5 to 10 minutes earlier than the other half. When the second half of the group finally gets their food it is cold. Incorrect check.So there you have it. The only reason it got 2 stars instead of 1 is that it is still a PF Chang's. If you are craving some PF Chang's, I recommend heading over to the Sherman Oaks location. If you are just looking for somewhere to eat before a movie, I recommend Ruth's Chris. Or McDonald's. Yeah, I would pick McDonald's over this PF Chang's.",91367

Now and then, we order their amazing food to go but we still prefer the ambience of eating dinner at their bar and the quick, attentive service we always receive.

The spare ribs, shrimp dumplings and a Asian salad with avocado and tomatoes.

My 3 star come from service...We ordered a bottle of sake, we got a glass, we ordered rice,  we didn't get it, the sauce didn't come with our lettuce wraps, took forever to get the bill.  Food was fine, but i think that's the last time we will be dinning here.

Our waitress was very nice, kind and professional. And our drinks were constantly brought refilled to the table which was very appreciated. However, the food was not so good. My sister in law ordered a vegetarian meal and we did the two for forty meal. We had egg drop soup that tasted off, chicken lettuce wraps, honey chicken, almond cashew chicken and the peanut butter crunch bar for dessert.  And we ordered a kids meal of lo mien with veggies and somehow they charged us for 2 kids meals! I have a 2yr old with me, how are they going to possibly eat 2 kids meals????Beyond that after we left we chatted a bit more and my sister in law had to start heading home. We decided to go in the mall to walk around and get some energy out of the kid before getting back in the car for a long drive. I started to feel really sick and got diearea and on the drive home we got a text that my sister in law was feeling very sick. And the toddler was screaming the whole way back home from stomach pain and my wife started complaining of stomach pain as well. When we got home my wife contacted the establishment and spoke with the manager to notify them that all of us had gotten sick after eating there and that we all had come from different locations so it was the only source, especially since it happened within 30min of leaving the establishment. The manager went on to argue with my wife denying that it could of been their food as we all had different things and there is no way that we got sick from there. However, there is no way we all got sick from anything else, and he should not of argued with my wife. We have always had good food from PF Changs, which is why we met up there to eat and talk. However after this experience and paying over $60 for a meal deal, TWO kids meals, and 2 drinks, to get sick and argued with the manager I will not be taking the family there or recommending it to anyone for a very long time.",91367

I said that was really the same price - It was $1/ ounce. I asked to speak to the manager. He said the server was wrong. They are all 6 ounce size, regardless of when you're buying it. I, then, told him that I asked for a chilled wine glass and the server told me they don't chill their glasses. She said could add soda water and I said no. I told this to the manager and he said they could definitely chill glasses and he also thought her suggestion was strange. He said, ""obviously she's not in a good mood and it's being directed to you so let's change servers."" I told him the order was taken and there was nothing for the server to do except serve the food. I asked if he could give me some sort of price adjustment and he said no. He could just change servers. I said pack up the food to go. The check came to $22.12. I gave the server $40.12. I received $2 in change from the server - NOT the $18 I was supposed to get. By this time, I was so angry. I called the manager over, again, and told him the mistake made with my money.

Chang's experience so much less desirable.P.F. Chang's has a good mobile app which makes ordering a take-out very easy and convenient.  We are now using P.F.

I went to this location a couple of nights ago with a friend as a pre-NYE hang out. Look, I get that it's the holidays and people are tired. I get that perhaps it was busy for a Monday night. Look, I'm with ya. But the beyond sub-par service isn't the first time and today just made me mad. In 2011 I wrote that this place had good service. Well, today, a day short of 2014, it does not have good service. Not even remotely close. Not even so much as to say my water came out promptly and I just waited on food from a backed up kitchen. I had arrived almost 20 minutes before my friend came as she was stuck in traffic. I was sat outside immediately as there was virtually no one sitting outside. Not sure why, it was gorgeous out. It took 10 minutes for someone to come by to me to ask me if I needed anything and/or if i was waiting for someone. My tea came about 5 minutes later. 15 minutes for tea!! It's a damn pot with hot water in it and a damn tea bag! Once my friend arrived it took another 15+ minutes to get a tea cup for her. We had been talking so I didn't really notice how much time had passed with out her having a tea cup. When it finally came, I paused and said, wait, are you JUST NOW getting your tea cup? It just went on from there. I believe our order went in around 6:30 at the latest and we started eating around 8:00 p.m. I'd like to blame this on a holiday back up, but honestly, this isn't the first time it's happened since my last review. It just happened to be the worst since. I will go to the Santa Monica PF next time I find myself going to PF Changs.",91367

Those with egg flower were satisfied as well. Those who ordered salads? Nope. It arrived a good 5-7 minutes after the soups.Sadly my boss had been the one to order the salad...  He was irritated with but they fired him up with the entree's. He ordered salmon and rice... His food showed up a after the rest of us were halfway done with our food. To top it off the salmon potion was extremely small- late and VERY small, he orders it often.  He told the waiter and he apologized. My boss was on a time crunch before his conference call and had to leave money for the check as he left. The waiter had approached as he was leaving and made no attempts to let him know he wasn't going to be charged. No apologies, no mention until we asked for his bill and then we were informed his bill was comped. I had my mid-year review after his conference call. He was still clearly spun up from the ordeal at lunch. We couldn't have paid PF Changs to pick on one person more. Sadly our lunch favorite is on the no go list for some time now.

I have wondered about the heritage of P.F. Chang's and in that regard I recently saw an article about Cecilia Chiang the doyenne of high end Chinese food in San Francisco at her renowned restaurant, The Mandarin (now closed). P.F. Chang was founded  by her son, Phillip, complete with a simplified spelling of the family name. So you might think it would be pretty good with that connection, right?Similar to the unhappy occasions I do visit McDonald's and swearing never to return, I think I have reached that point with P.F. Chang's. While the others in my group seemed to like it, I do not think any of them have actually had good Chinese food.Anyway, lettuce wraps are kinda tasty, but the closest thing I have ever had at a real place was Minced Squab at Fung Lum years ago. Kung pao scallops, kung pao shrimp, mandarin beef, spicy beef, hot and sour soup, and pork dumpling (allegedly pan fried) were all bad. Just bad. The breading or whatever it was on the Kung Pao seafood was particularly objectionable, the quality of the shrimps and scallops worse than I would find acceptable at Panda Express.Desserts were ok but, of course have nothing whatsoever to do with Chinese cuisine.Speaking of Panda Express, when I do choose to go there I have low expectations, it is cheap, and I enjoy eating it more than the product turned out by P.F.

This is not the first time they have dropped the ball.  It only took the bartender/waiter 17 minutes to ask me If I needed chopsticks  soI could not actually eat my sushi. My main meal is took 60 minutes to come out.  I didn't say anything but they knew the delay was ridiculous and comped the meal. I would rather have my food brought to me on time instead of spending over 90 minutes in the restaurant waiting.  This location has issues.,91367

Take the TunaTartare. Nice chunks of Ahi and avocado with wonton crisps to serve it on. A recipe so good I looked it up online and made it at home. But tonight-- I got little pieces of diced tuna with onions and a few slices of avocado on -- a few 1 inch pieces of wontons. It looked like somebody's leftover Pace Picante with broken chips. We had to ask about five times for a silverware set up and iced tea and my normally delicious fried rice tasted like rice a roni.

This was very unprofessional on the managers part,, manager should have asked Adam to go to the back and talk to him privately instead of embarrassing him in front of the clients.

Waiting 30-40 minutes with a little pager to eat so-so quasi Chinese food seems like a waste of fucking time. However if you are smack in the middle of higher/upper middle class Whitesville then this is the normal thing to do. Like a robot I stand with my little pager hoping the food g-d of PF will call me home in a rapture of blinking lights and vibrations. Thirty-six and a half minutes in I realize I've been numbed by it all. The food could suck beyond all hell and I would still rate them 4 stars. I could claim the devil made me do it and all would be forgiven.

OK NEW math is being used here.

One star ~Belch, thats for the salt, or was it pepper shrimp and the chicken in black bean sauce. Even the rice was bad.
Four stars ~Yum, I really liked the sea bass in ginger soy with baby corn and spinach.
Five stars ~Fun with Mai Tais
One star ~Absolutely NO Asian people in or around the place. Nada, zip, nil, bupkis! (white words)
Five stars ~Cuteass wait staff even if they are dumber than a bag of hammers. Really, this kid had NO idea why he was mixing the special sauce for us. We asked, ""what do we use it for???"" 
One star ~Dumb/cuteass waiter forgot or messed up almost everything and then sent the 14 year old manager over to apologize for the delays. I think it would have been better if our waiter did it instead....even if only once. 
Three stars ~ Decor is cookie cutter BRANDING, but at least it's pleasant.

So there is no way to really total those numbers. With the plethora of great mom and pop dining choices I still don't get why one would wait 30-40 min for PF's

My over all impression of the place is 3 1/3 stars.",91367

The server wasn't very sympathetic at all kinda just brushed it off & we ordered new drinks . No mention of them being taken off the bill . Next we ordered lobster fried rice & garlic noodles both seafood dishes we asked for spicy . They slathered siricha on the rice ruining the dish & the noodles alike had a strange acquired taste overall food seasoning was TERRIBLE . We simply ate the seafood everything else went to waste . We expressed our feelings ab the food again server was unsympathetic no mention of fixing it or removing from the bill .

They aren't kidding about it being very creamy) and Tiramisu Mini (I liked that the best. It made me wish I could get it in a regular size.

I have celiac disease so it's difficult finding restaurants with decent gluten free menus, let alone gluten free Chinese food! When I came here I was delighted when they had a full gluten free menu including appetizers, entrees, and even desert. Our server, Hector was so kind and knowledgeable about celiac disease and made sure my meal wasn't cross-contaminated and even brought me gluten free soy sauce packets. Our food- gf chang's spicy chicken and Mongolian beef was soooo bomb. Then we had gf strawberry shortcake which was also delicious. I will definitely be coming back in the future when I'm craving Chinese food! Shoutout to Hector our waiter !!",91367

Hot and sour soup - deliciousThe only downfall is the reception area and attentiveness of the reception staff.  A little more welcoming and friendly would be nice and would put this location at a five star for me.Good parking and usually space available even on weekends.

I might have caught them on an off night, when people just weren't bringing their A-Game, but I would have to say I was a little disappointed by my experience at PF Changs Woodland Hills. I ordered takeout; everything on the order was gluten free. One of those gluten free items was the wrap appetizer. The filling itself was gluten free, so it would make sense that they would give it to you with a baggy full of lettuce with gluten free sauce, right?I guess not at this PF Changs. Nope, they tried to give me lettuce wraps with regular ol' gluten-filled sauce, even though I payed the $1 upcharge to get it gluten free. They happily replaced the sauce & lettuce (lest there be cross contamination) after I pressed. But still. What a rookie mistake. That aside, I didn't get sick.

Maybe its because they know my face and I tip well?  I don't care, I still appreciate it.  I don't get that same treatment at other places.  Its one of the few chains I will actually go to in order to have a drink.  And this is only PF Changs location I bother coming to, I've tried a few others and  the other bartenders don't do it like they do.  Seems to be well managed, many locals frequent this bar for the same reason I do.

4249,"21821 Oxnard St Woodland Hills, CA 91367",Scott B.,"Canyon Country, CA",3/11/2013,3,"I met a friend here for dinner.  We walked in the side entrance, and found our way to the front of the place to get a table. As I walked in, at first glance, the place seemed very very nice. The lighting was romantic, the terra cotta soldiers were all over the place guarding stuff, the great big oriental tapestry was hung with care, and there were white people working. Apparently, very nice Chinese restaurants do not have Chinese people working there.  Who knew?       It looked kinda busy, and there were waiters and staff and people walking all around, but during our stroll through the place to get up to the hostess stand I did see some empty tables. We asked for a table, and they sat us down pretty much immediately. It was a little bit until our waiter showed up.      The dude got our drink orders, handed us menus, and whooshed off to get our beverages. While perusing the menu, I noticed happily that there were some not so expensive things, as well as some expensive things. When the waiter came back with the drinks, we had figured out what we wanted. I ordered the combo fried rice and my friend went with a cup of won-ton soup, and some egg rolls off the appetizer menu.     We sat and caught up and waited a little bit for our food to come out.  The plates were hot when they came out, I tested my fried rice, and it was great. It had several of god's animals in it. Shrimp, Beef, Chicken....and it was all cooked & seasoned well. It was some damn fine fried rice. My friend said her stuff was also good.      As we ate, I began to realize that my iced tea had run dry. I attempted the ""Bianchi Waiter Call Maneuver"" by sucking on the straw in the cup, empty of liquid, and making alot of noise..but nothin. I remembered had a cup of ice water anyhow, I switched to that and continued with my meal. I wasn't able to finish my rice, and when a bus-guy (not even the bus-people are Chinese) came over to begin clearing our plates, he asked if he could pack up my rice. He ran to get a to-go box and packed it up. I was quite impressed at his skill of packing up. Not a single grain of fried rice was lost.      After some more waiting, the waiter came back, and left us the bill and 4 fortune cookies.  (2 of which were duplicates, luckily we both happened to get one) Maybe the extra fortunes were the waiters way of apologizing for all the waiting. I dunno.     Towards the end of the meal, the couple at the next table over was greeting their camera wielding mother. Over the next few minutes, I was blinded by several bright flashes of her camera. She was taking pictures of her newborn grand-child with Dad, with Mom, with Dad and Mom, and of Dad...lots and lots of pictures. It was practically a disco with all the flashing lights in my face.       I took the light-spots in my vision as a sign that I was to leave. I took care of the bill, which ended up being about 30 bucks with tax and tip for the both of us. Not too bad. Thank you for your service P.F. Chang's,  I may or may not be back sometime in the future.",91367

4259,"21821 Oxnard St Woodland Hills, CA 91367",David O.,"Encinitas, CA",11/6/2006,4,"Friday Night, 7 PM.   We just got out of Borat and we're hungry.   The parking lot at the Westfield Promenade is a sea of cars.   Some are coming in, others are trying to make their way out.  It's a complete clusterfuck and just the thought of fighting my way out of here is raising my blood pressure.  So off to P.F. Chang's we go.

People are congregated outside, each clutching at their pager like a heroin addict holding his spoon in anticipation for his next fix.   We put our name on the list and they tell us 30-45 minutes.  We too, get one of those pagers and we make our way towards the bar.

I get a Bombay Sapphire Martini, slightly dirty.  My wife gets Mojito.  The bartender's nice enough and apparently made the drinks properly (my wife watched him the whole time) but my martini still tastes like bathwater.   I know martinis, and this ain't one.   No matter, as I feel that the gin, or whatever the fuck it is, is slowly making its way down my esophagus and numbing the droning noise that envelops us (why is it so fucking loud in here anyway?  Were they trying for such good acoustics?)   My wife's also not too thrilled with her drink.  I take a sip and it's pure sugar.   If I were rating the drinks alone, they'd be getting 2 stars... and that'd be just for service.

We finish our drinks and go back outside for a while.   We talk, and talk, and talk.   It's been one hour and still no nothing.  The last 15 minutes I've been watching that damn thing like a weird Ouija Board controller.  I'm just waiting for the pager to start buzzing and lighting up like one of those obnoxious Vegas casino jackpots, but it stays dark and oblivious to my pain.

We go in and talk to the desk, and apparently they buzzed us 20 minutes ago....   That's odd cuz that's the same fucking excuse we've gotten 3 or 4 times before at different P.F. Chang's whenever our pager doesn't work.   Or worse yet, is the evil broken pager following us around California?  Anyway, we must have had ""that look"" because they seat us immediately.

Thankfully, from that point on, things got a lot better.

The decor is cool.   I like the look of P.F. Chang's, not so much this location in particular, but all of them.   The lighting is subdued.   The ceilings are tall... 20 feet tall, and the colors on the walls, while warm, give a certain modern sensibility to the whole place.  This feeling is accentuated by the really cool and really funky round solar lamps that hang from the ceiling and give off a mellow orange glow.  I so want some of those for my loft!  They look totally money!   To contrast with the modern design, they have a few large Ming (I believe they're Ming, but don't hold me on that) statues in a few places around the bar and restaurant.  Let's say the decor works well.  That would get 5 stars in my book.

The place was packed, every table busy.   It's still loud as fuck and even though we can hold a conversation, it's the kind of background noise that is probably calculated perfectly.  The decibels will not hinder your dinner experience, but they will make you want to head for the door after one hour, or 1.5 hours tops.   Perfect...that'll clear the table for the next patrons.    Anyway, back to the service... our waitress, Danielle, totally rocks.   Despite how busy she was, she refilled our water glasses multiple times and the bottle of Sonoma Cutrer Chardonnay we ordered was served at the perfect temperature:  55 degrees.  Service?  4 stars.   It'd have been 5, but that fucking evil broken pager cost 'em one...

Now for the food.   

We started out with the crab wontons and the Peking Dumplings for appetizers and we then shared Chang's Spicy Chicken and the Garlic Noodles.   I also asked if the kitchen could make me the ""ring of fire"" sauce, which isn't on the menu but if you're in the know, they'll make it for you.  It's made with garlic chili sauce, whole roasted thai chilis, garlic, the whole stir fried.  It's very tasty and very spicy.   Let's just say I need to apply aloe vera to my tongue and lips by the time we'd finished dinner, and you find out why they call it the ""ring of fire"" the next morning.

The Crab wontons were, alas, too soggy.  The oil they fried it in must not have been hot enough, but I've seriously had better.  Now for the filling, though, you could actually taste the crab and they didn't go overboard on the cream cheese, which was nice.   The Peking Dumplings, however, were totally good.  They were crunchy on the outside, stuffed with some tender and hot meat, and they did not feel greasy, as dumplings sometimes can.

Chang's Spicy Chicken was lean, tender, spicy, and served very hot, meaning that you didn't end up with cold chicken by the end of your meal.  It was very well prepared and had a nice kick to it.  Of course, smothered in the ring of fire, that was a non-issue anyway.  Garlic noodles?  They had a nice garlic flavor, but were unfortunately too sweet.",91367

I always talked smack about PF Chang being an overglorified chinese restaurant that's extremely Americanized.....I think I'm halfway wrong and right.We arrived still early, so there were plenty of seats available, big plus. It was a lot darker than I expected though, and it made it somewhat hard to see. The servers were extremely nice and very attentive, he kept coming back every few minutes to see if we needed anything. Not once did I ever have to request a refill, it was brought out almost automatically. When he was going on his lunch break, he even came around to each table that he was serving and gave a short speech and introduction to the server that was replacing him (by the way, he did a much better job)We went with the two for 40 deal, which included an appetizer, two entrees, and two desserts. First and foremost, you need to try out the lettuce wraps. The chicken that they use for the filling is absolutely delicious! If you ask the servers, they will show you how it's done, instant flavor high!The ""Kogi"" tacos were very mediocre, though, there wasn't very much flavor embedded within.The main entrees were great, very good flavor for the honey chicken and the Mongolian beef. When it came time for the desserts as part of the special, the desserts came out in these little shot glasses, and it appeared that everything was layered (one layer graham cracker, one layer cheese/cake, one layer topping, repeat. All in all, this location provided excellent service, although you may experience a little wait time for the food. When we got there, the place was still empty, but by the time we left, the restaurant became very packed. As stated, the servers are very friendly (almost to the point where it was kind of scary), and there was a line for the bathroom, but for sure I'd give this location another visit.",91367

Why should I pay for overpriced, oversalty, Chinese food when I can get it for much tastier at a real Chinese place??? I didn't want other people to think more of the place when they saw me, a real Chinese, eating there. I had eaten here once before, also unwillingly, for a friend's birthday dinner but it was a really long time ago, so I THOUGHT I would give it another shot since the BF loves it. No, I don't know how I could date someone who LOVES PFCHANGS!!! So it was a chilly Saturday night. We waited about 5 minutes for outdoor seating and would have been longer for inside. In this 5 minutes, we ordered drinks at the bar (everything tastes better when you're drunk). We ordered the garlic noodles, wok seared lamb, side of brussels sprouts, and the crispy honey shrimp. Since I know white-Chinese food is super salty for my pallet, I asked for everything low-sodium. I wasn't sure they could accommodate but they did, and it seemed like it was not a rare thing to ask for.Garlic noodles: They don't use real Chinese noodles. It almost looked like linguine and it was pretty tasteless (not because of the low-sodium).Wok seared lamb: I liked this dish the best. I expected lamb chops but it was actually  minced lamb with a very bold flavor but not that bold lamb flavor. Crispy honey shrimp: Light batter, big shrimps, good flavor.Brussels sprouts: Terrible! I guess our bad for not reading the description thoroughly but it was thinly shaved brussels sprouts, which I've never seen before. There was no flavor at all. It was like eating lettuce, not that lettuce is bad but weird for a side.PLUS, everything came out half warm. Some were warm and some were half warm. Were we that much farther away from the kitchen???Service: OK. Since we were outside, the waiters don't frequent as much. It was getting chilly and I asked for the heaters to be turned back on but it never happened. The waiter either lied or didn't know how to turn it on, so basically he lied.Price: This is what I was the unhappiest about. For our 3 plates (fine, 4, but 1 was a side!) and 2 drinks, the bill came out to about $70. That's $85ish after tip. That is A LOT for NOT a lot of food(in my mind, I know I could have gotten it for less than half that at a real Chinese restaurant).I still stand by my opinion that I don't like this place and I will not come back again unless I have to!!!",91367

So being adventurous wife and I decided to try the spicy tuna, the menu mentioned that it came with a dash of Sriracha, so the plate comes and 4 of the 8 pieces are basically swimming in the Sriracha, not really what we expected, the spicy tuna itself was acceptable but floating it in the Sriracha was not really necessary and actually overpowered the tuna itself.  Our waitress was either over worked or just plain not organized because she carried the wife's cup of coffee to two other tables, back to the kitchen, then to another table and finally to us.

Heck, why am I even here?  I guess PF Changs is the place to go when you can't decide where to go.The biggest problem with this location is spotty service - sometimes good, sometimes not so.  This has been one of my most predictably boring reviews ever, but it stands to reason because that description perfectly fits PF Changs.",91367

They serve Chinses food but they don't want to associate themselves with the culture.

Option#1, Take out orders go to a live person. Option#2 goes to voice-mail. They can care less what you have to ask unless you are ordering something.

Our service was a bit slow as well which was odd considering that the restaurant wasn't very busy at all.And finally, there were 2 straws on the floor in the dining room when we arrived; one in front of our table and another in front of a table that we walked by on our way to our table. The issue here is that despite the numerous people that walked by this garbage on the floor while we were there, (hostess's, Servers, and bussers, nobody bothered to take a second to pick up the trash off the floor.

My sister and I came in for lunch on a Saturday around 2 pm and the restaurant was not busy at all. I have tried P.F. Chang's for the first time in Las Vegas recently and loved it. Anyway, we were seated and we waited a while for the waitress to show up and take our drink order and we put in our appetizer orders as well which was California rolls and chard Brussels sprouts (nothing that too complicated or crazy). We sat there and waited for probably close to 30 minutes and then the waitress brings completely the wrong items. After I told her that is not what we ordered, she took another 15 minutes to bring back the correct items. We then placed another order for another item, the Long-Life noodles. I had to ask to get my drink filled by another waiter in the restaurant. As we are eating, we get a plate sent to our table. Again, this item was not something that we ordered. We waited for another 15 minutes then the manager comes out and delivers our noodles personally, apologizes for the delay and says a desert is on him. I didn't complain or express to him my dissatisfaction with the service but accepted his offer. He brought out another drink and it had a piece of vegetable (not from our dishes) at the bottom of the glass. I informed him and he brought out another right away. We put in our dessert order and guess what? When it came out they said they ""ran out"" of the flavor we wanted so we were SOL. I understand that the desert was complimentary but the service was terrible. I don't feel entitled to anything but it was the least they can do to redeem their slow and messy service that day.  They even charged me for soda water in which I had never been charged for in any other restaurant. Not that it makes a difference, but I will never be returning to this mess of a location again. There needs to be better communication which the staff or something. There shouldn't be such a huge wait time especially when the restaurant is not busy at all. Get it together, P.F. Chang's!",91367

Our double pan fried noodle was a little gooey and a bit too salty.  I believe a double pan fried noodle should be slightly crispy and crunchy but I could be wrong ... I'd never tried it here before so maybe this is just the way it is here.Finally, the hostesses were so kind and nice and helpful.  It's so great when a restaurant trains their staff and every member of the staff is a professional.  Whoever is training the staff here is doing a fantastic job.  Some of the bizarre people at the bar had attitudes but not one staff member did.  Every staff member I encountered was friendly and nice.If it weren't so crowded here I'd probably go more often.  The lighting is just perfect although it's a bit loud for my liking.  it's nice to see a restaurant that really knows what they're doing and they do it well.",91367

Do not order fish at  a restaurant that is sketch or a chain...because you will be sadly disappointed...(most of the time its really fishy and disgusting because its either frozen or not fresh...especially americanized restaurants...)2. Don't order something that you loved at another restaurant because your bound to be disappointed.3. Don't order something that isn't a popular dish...ask the waiter...the dish is popular for a reason...because its better than all the rest...4. If your unsure about the restaurant go for lunch...if the place is gross at least it will be a cheaper gross experience...hahaanyways back to this place...don't hate me but i actually had some good food here...kinda pricey considering what they're serving you but not bad...the lettuce wrap was good...(ask for more lettuce before your waiter slips away and disappears into oblivion like ours did) skip the fish dishes...(my dumb friend orders the salmon and spinach thingy against my advice and she regretted it later...gross fishiness ensued...ps..she didn't eat it )  the mongolian beef is really good actually...one of the better things on the menu...they have beer so bottoms up...lol that good...the walnut shrimp was okay...had better...the kung pao was okay...not fabulous...fried rice was boring...ehh...but don't listen to me i don't like fried rice so i'm biased...desert..fried bananas...some might like it...gross to me...so recap...the mongolian beef was good...lettuce wraps were good...if anything get those...,91367

Good thing we had reservations -- we didn't wait as long.We sat down and waited a good while until we were served -- and it was because my friend's husband had to complain about our long wait and no one had even acknowleged us or offered us water. After that -- two servers approached our table and the manager came to apologize.I've been to many restaurants and I can count only a handful of times the manager had come to apologize.Since then, the service had been superb. My friend is vegetarian, so I was pleased that they had plenty of vegetarian options. The lettuce wrap was great. I also enjoyed the eggplant dish, and the kung pao chicken. I was also happy that there was a brown rice option with no additional fee (most places charge more because it's special order).Lastly, our appertizers were comped by the manager -- so a table filled with delicious cuisine for four people ended up costing just $30.Sure, they required a little prompting, but I was very very satisfied with the overall experience.",91367

We didn't take it, but we appreciated the offer.LOWBad server. Got my wine order wrong. Got my entree wrong. Incredibly slow. Dinner for two took almost 3 hours.Bad food. I got the same dish that I have been getting at P.F. Chang's for the better part of six years (Cantonese Chow Fun), and this was the only time it came out and was BAD - dry, bland. And remember that this is AFTER getting the wrong entree. After multiple failures, I was hoping that we would get some sort of make-good when the bill came. Our bill was for the full amount. We thought about saying something to the manager but decided it would be more appropriate to educate you, dear reader, rather than make a scene in the restaurant.

Chang experiences.1. Lettuce Wraps: love them, they're amazing2. Pork spare ribs: Too sweet and oyster saucey for me.  Some times too crispy3. Dynamite Shrimp: I like it but I feel like it's not worth it to order when I'm trying to stay within a budget4. Spring rolls: pass on them, tastes below average5. Hot and Sour soup: Their huge bowl of soup is awesome.  I love them!  I feel like I need to order them whenever I go there.6. Chicken salad: I normally wouldn't order a salad here but once I tried it, I really enjoyed it.  It's not really as filling especially for the price but I really do love it.  I think the secret is in their dressing.  I've probably ordered this like 5+ times.7. Chicken with black sauce: Classic, you can't go wrong with this.8. Kung Pao: Flavorful for sure but too much other stuff (chili peppers, peanuts, etc) and not enough chicken9. Crispy Honey chicken: Awesome stuff.  Order it if you have a hard time deciding and you're looking for like orange chicken-type10. Orange chicken: Nahh, I'll pass.  The orange zest thing isn't my thing although the quality of the chicken is better than those heavily battered cheapo places.11. Orange beef: Nahh squared.  12. Pepper steak: probably my favorite beef dish.  It's definitely more steak-y than just beef-y.13. Lemongrass prawns: It's good but difficult to eat as the meat is hard to separate from the shell.  Also as leftovers, they're terrible.14. Scallops: I love the scallop dishes but you'll realize how quickly the scallops disappear.  They cook them very well where it's super tender and not rubbery.15. Fried rice: It's alright nothing special.  I'd pass on this as well.16. Garlic noodles: I find them too oily, especially as leftovers.17. Singapore street noodles: I think it's the best noodle dish.  I really like it and probably would be my default orderThey also offer happy hour.  Finding decent food late at night can be difficult so PF Chang is reliable until midnight.  Take-out from here is great and I always enjoy it.  When the sauce-man comes, just tell him you'll do it yourself.  When the fortune cookies comes, always add ""in bed"" afterwards.",91367

Firstly, the sauces they put on the table... uh ok? She had us so confused what she was going to do/not do that we said just do it. All she did was take a scoop of each and put it in the middle one. OK? I thought she was going to mix up something amazing. Not. We ordered the P.F Changs for two for $39.99. Maybe I had really high expectations for the lettuce wrap, but it did not live up to my expectations at all. Don't get me wrong, it was really good but I've had better. For the entrees, we got the peppered steak and crispy honey shrimp. Both entrees were pretty good. I wasn't expecting the steak to be drenched in a sauce, but it was stil tasty. I liked the shrimp the best. It was semi sweet and just the right amount of crispy-ness. Now the best part of the meal, the mini desserts. We had the tirimisu and raspberry cheesecake. I think I really enjoyed it because it was so cute and came in a little shot glass. The service here was pretty good. She did what she had to do. But, I remember asking her for salt&pepper (for the soup), she brought it out when we already finished the soup and already eating the lettuce wrap. uh thanks? Btw, happy hour, $2 pbr.

Then Steve (looked like a manager) took over as the bar tender had many clients at the bar and I was done in 5 minutes! in addition, Steve offered me a cold soda for the road on the house. Considering it was 108 degrees outside, it was very thoughtful and I appreciated that. The food was packed properly and the 15 minutes drive home with AC blasting high did not have an impact on food temperature. The quality of food was superb. We truly enjoyed it.

If you want to go someplace with a wide variety of not-too-exotic Chinese-like food (sorry, I have family in Singapore and will not call this anywhere near authentic Chinese food), then this is the place. Now, despite my snark, I'm giving this place three stars because, well, you know what you're getting, so you can't be too upset by the Americanized dishes. However, the service is not very good (we received the wrong check), and the prices are too high for what you're getting. For example, a basic salmon dish (i.e., no sophistication or especially pricey ingredients) cost $19.95 and really should cost $15.95.

A great way to impress say a date or friends but it all goes downhill when you actually taste the food. I suppose the money you are paying is for the ambiance, atmosphere.

I can almost always find at least one thing on any menu that I will eat but P.F. Chang's is the rare exception. Everything is just so bland and mediocre. The sauce demonstration is kind of cool the first time you see it done (I think we had a good server the first time I came here) but when you taste it, it's just kind of blah.They have a full bar which SOUNDS cool but I ordered one of their drink specials at the bar and it was so fruity and sweet that I couldn't even finish it (rare for me).Service is pretty hit or miss at this place.

I went for dinner here last night with my Mom because there really aren't any reasonably priced, nice places to go in her neighborhood. I like the ambiance and the people at PF Changs, but they need to improve the food. We had the usual Chicken Lettuce Wraps, which tasted just ok. Our server did not prepare the special sauce as I've experienced in other PF Chang locations, just plopped it all down together. And the white, crispy noodle things the meat is served over were so hard I almost broke a tooth. We shared the Orange Peel Shrimp which tasted like old rubber shoes in a spicy orange sauce. How old is the shrimp, one might wonder? With the appetizer, 2 glasses of $9 chardonnay, and a side of garlic snap peas, the bill came to around $52 not including the tip. Not cheap for mediocre food. The last straw was the large white spider that came scampering up the back of the booth to check out the feast. Ahhhhh! Halloween was last week.",91367

The dishes are always made perfectly, and if something has ever come out not as expected the waiters have always taken it back and remade it according to my liking!

Tried the banana spring rolls but they're not really my cup of tea. Decent though, if you like this type of dessert more than CHOCOLATE! Could get pricey with sake and teas.

It happened I never visited PFChangs because it's a network and I prefer family owned businesses when it comes to Chinese food. This time we were close by and decided to have diner. Now speaking of price/quality usually when I see Panda express price ranges I expect Panda express quality. It is good though when you hungry and do not want to spend much money. When the price range is higher my expectations are higher as well. So far it worked perfectly well. Every time you pay over $10 for Mongolian beef it's expected to be way better than one for $6. Same for shrimps, soups. I have few dishes which allow me to get my restaurant rating. So I can always compare apples to apples. PFChang's is pretty expensive. While quality wise way lower than many 'panda-express-level' places. Yes it's nice in and out. Probably nice place for date. But what about food?.. Bottom line - PFChang's (at least one in Woodland Hills) was a total disappointment and waste of money. Any other place in that area will beat this one.

To start off with, the service really sucked. Our waitress did not know anything about the menu, could not even answer the simplest of questions (which is sweeter, the northern style spare ribs or the chang's BBQ spare ribs?). My husband had to ask for a lemon slice for his ice tea three times! And then our waitress took forever to come back and take our order.The menu has changed and some of their signature dishes have been reworked to cut their costs and make a bigger profit margin. For example the Kung Pao chicken. This dish alone was the reason we came to PF Chang's. It was unique, delicious, loaded with peanuts and not sauced down. It was a dish we could not duplicate at home. The new makeover has half the amount of chicken, half the amount of peanuts, and is loaded up with sauce that tastes like it came from a bottle and tons of sliced celery which is completely unnecessary in this dish. It's filler. The crab wontons had a small amount of filling before but now it is nonexistent. And that refreshing julienned carrot and cucumber salad on the side? Gone. And they pour that not-so-good sweet sauce over the whole bottom of the plate so your wontons that at one time were fried crispy, are now soggy and soaked in a gross sauce. The salt and pepper prawns (why are they called prawns? They're shrimp, and certainly not as big as they used to be) are overly salted. Barely edible. Yes, this was always a salty dish, but now it is over the top. Remember when you got your own bowl of rice? Not anymore. Now ONE bowl of rice is paired with each entree. Really? I can't have my own bowl of rice? The restaurant was barely 1/2 full at 6:30 pm and we were pressured to hurry up and leave. We were still eating our dinner when our waitress came back and asked us if we wanted to see a dessert menu. When we said no, the check came immediately out, even before our plates were cleared. But I think the topper of the night was when I was in the bathroom washing my hands. I hear the toilet flush, see the hostess walk out of the stall, pick up a dirty paper towel off the floor, throw it in the trash and walk out without WASHING HER HANDS! At least she's not handling our food, right?Like I said, we will not be coming back.",91367

As I walk I was worried I was under dressed and my wallet would take a massive hit. Well we get inside and hey...this is a large place with awesome artwork,architecture and many waiters. BUT...the customers look like they too were way under dressed..whats up? So we get a nice table and Alex helps us. He give advice and we settle for the deal for two for about $40...Alex says they are known for huge portions. I said ok.Full surprised when a child's size bowl of soup for each of us is served. Then the calamari was ok ,,but then again...enough for one..not two. Then to my horror the main dish; Alex lied!  Appetizer size plates with maybe 2 spoonfuls amounts of the dish. The meals were so simple that I have seen them in every corner $1 joint. My shrimp had so much breading, I could have used it for a PJ sanwich! Mushy! Two small bowls of rice.  For $40 this is a bit on the sparse side. Then the dessert...now this meal is a ""for two"" but they only offer one piece! I (we) got the key lime pie. OMG this thing was smaller then sushi! To make matters worse..I got charged for a glass of soda water...not a bottle. Well I finally figured out WHAT the place is....imagine McDonald's building a super beautiful building and putting the business inside. Same food same attitudes....Yes same McDonald's fast food. Well PF Chang is 100% fast food quality food in a overwhelming building.

Perfectly crisp on the outside and juicy on the inside, big portion size, great lemon sauce!!! A little on the pricey side at $15. More than worth it. However, I found a recipe for it online.

Way too mushy, the eggplant often slid off of the skin. More oily than necessary, but since it's cooked in Mono- and Poly- unsaturated oil, i'll let it fly. $8.50.Other things I've had that deserve mentioning:Peking DuckMandarin Chickenand my BF likes their Sweet and Sour soup.so -1 star for the overcooked eggplant, as eggplant is pretty easy to cook and it would've been incredible had it been done right.aside from that, i love love love their scallops, what can I say?",91367

Oh and lose the atitude about being an ""upscale"" eatery. You are in Woodland Hills not Beverly Hills.",91367

It was about 9:30pm Saturday night. The place looked almost empty from outside. We waited 20mins to be seated. The host estimated a 20min wait and that's about how long it took. We were seated. The waitress Kristi came to us after about 5mins. She seemed to be in a rush. Who knows why because the place did not look full and there were several tables around us empty. She immediately offered us more time but we were ready. I ordered Chang's Spare Ribs to start off with. Ordered Sweet and Sour Chicken, Mongolian Beef, Garlic Noodles and PF Chang's Fried Rice.I ordered a Coke and Fiji water to drink. Some one else brought us the water. Wish I would have gotten his name because he was funny. He made a joke in reference to the water we had and to the Fiji water.About 15min later the waitress brought the spare ribs. They were delicious. Uhmmm uhmmmm..! My date didn't like them. She said the spices were too strong.About 20min after that, the same guy who brought the water brought our food. He made another joke. He was funny and had a good personality.The Sweet and Sour Chicken was good. Not the best, compared to what I've had at other PF Chang's. The Mongolian Beef was delicious. Best part of the meal. The Garlic Noodles felt kind of dry to me and a bit flavorless.PF Chang's Fried Rice was good. It always is. So far the waitress has communicated with us once. When she took the order. But I see her asking a few tables around us if they are ok and asks them how the meal is. Half way through the meal the waitress comes by and asks my date if we need anything. I'm thinking ""what!?!"", I ordered the food, which puts me as the head of the table.  She did that twice. So we're done with our food and ask for dogie bags. She brings the little carton containers but not the black and see-through plastic ones. She kind of struggled to get the food in there. That was funny. I'm looking through the receipt and realize she didn't bring the coke I asked for. I pay, leave a small tip and I leave. The food overall was good. The service by the waitress needs improvement.",91367

The Mongolian beef is one of my favorites along with the Wedge Salad. I've had other dishes but Mongolian beef always comes out on top.For dessert, BANANA SPRING ROLLS -- Six warm, crispy bites with coconut-pineapple ice cream and drizzled with caramel and vanilla sauce.

I thought its was pretty lame to sort of kick us out when we in fact were enjoying ourselves with waitress and its not like we were the last ones. management there must be reevaluated. because whoever made this decision can not be managing a place like this. because it is losing owner money and customer. they gave us some 10$ off coupons of 40 dollars spent. as if to reconcile the situation. but I really don't go back there unless it is the last place open and there is no where else to go. we were paying customers, ready to buy more and we were denied service because bartender wanted to close up bar early and go home. 2 stars because drinks signature cocktails were good. very poor customer service.

The weird thing is they gave us almost an entire head of lettuce for a small amount of meat. Dinner consisted of honey chicken, honey shrimp, sweet and sour pork, and some pan fried noodles. If I could sum up dinner in one word, it would be SOGGY. The honey chicken was fried and the sauce was to way to sweet. The honey shrimp suffered from the same to sweet sauce and grocery store quality frozen shrimp. The sweet and sour pork was just sweet and sour mush. The wife reported that the pan fried noodles were oily and tasted horrible. I'm not sure why anyone would actually CHOOSE to eat at a place like this but hey if you're up for some bad food coupled with bad service, PF Changs is the place to be.",91367

The egg rolls where swimming in grease. The Samuel Adams beer was the only positive aspect of the meal and the only credit the restaurant can take for that is that they served it cold.

Chang's.",91367
4524,"21821 Oxnard St Woodland Hills, CA 91367",B R.,"Northridge, CA",5/20/2012,2,Food did not have good flavor. The noodles tasted stale.  Third time was not a charm. For that price the should spend time on the flavor and quality more,91367
4525,"21821 Oxnard St Woodland Hills, CA 91367",Michael M.,"Napa, CA",7/19/2012,1,Service is terrible. We had to request our server numerous times without any success. I was so looking forward to one of my favorite places. Now I am taking it off my list. Too bad.,91367

4527,"21821 Oxnard St Woodland Hills, CA 91367",A F.,"Simi Valley, CA",11/20/2010,3,"was there today, I haven't gone in a while. The restaurant has nice atmosphere, but a little dissapointing. My glass was dirty, then my knife had a piece of rice stuck on it. So I was grossed out.  One of the dishes had green onions with pieces of the head of the onion (which is the part you throw away). The food was good, but then I had a stomach ache.  So not very impressed.  The waitress was nice, our food took a long time and didn't see much of the waitress. Probably won't go back for a while. I could get better Chinese style food else where.",91367
4528,"21821 Oxnard St Woodland Hills, CA 91367",Beth B.,"WOODLAND HLS, CA",12/21/2011,1,"Food was good, service was horrid. We went on a Sunday before 11;45 just to avoid what happened. We got there and got seated right away, with only two other tables in our section, and waited, and waited, and waited. Apparently it was more important to the ***3** servers in the area to fill the sugars and light the candles rather then serve us. After 20 minutes when we were about to get up and leave, someone asks has anyone served us. Nope... ok, got drinks and appetiser order in. And waited. And waited..... it took over an hour to get in and out for lunch, I think it took 20 minutes again to get our check and pay. The food was good, but the service has made us rethink about sitting again. If my friend wants her hot and sour soup, we will defienlty order for takeout, the service is subpar for what you are paying. Never sitting down there again.",91367
4529,"21821 Oxnard St Woodland Hills, CA 91367",DAVID S.,"Woodland Hills, CA",3/24/2009,2,"Went to this location of PF Changs for the **** time to celebrate  a birthday.  They still have the same menu; and have a new $39 set price menu you must ask for.  We had to ask 3 times to get that  menu and finally did.  We ordered and had to send back the Mongolian Beef 2 times as the waiter knew it was burnt.  They seem to have to have changed their portion sizes; some recipes,  and  even the Kung Pao was way way off, looking as if it was recooked in a microwave.  The manager and waiter both indicated there were new chefs and they didn't always cook the way the Asian chefs did in the past.  Overall, very average, for what used to be a really good place to eat.  The $39 menu is a good deal; 2 soups, 1 appetizer; 2 entrees; and 2 little deserts.  So, if you go, try that menu and save a few bucks.",91367
